The introduction of metallurgy which initiated unprecedented technological progress has also been linked with the establishment of social stratification and distinction between rich and poor and precious metals as the means to fundamentally control the dynamics of culture and society.

The introduction of metallurgy which initiated unprecedented technological progress has also been linked with the establishment of social stratification and distinction between rich and poor and precious metals as the means to fundamentally control the dynamics of culture and society. In Northern Europe, societies were able to live well on rich food supplies from the marshlands, which had been created by the warmer climate. Other phenomena are the expansion of Megalithism, the appearance of the first significant economic stratification and the related first known monarchies in the Balkan region. Labour specialisation, economic stratification and possibly the risk of invasion may have been the reasons behind that development. From 2800 BC, the Danubian Seine-Oise-Marne culture pusheed directly or indirectly southwards and destroyed most of the rich Megalithic culture of western France.

The introduction of metallurgy which initiated unprecedented technological progress has also been linked with the establishment of social stratification and distinction between rich and poor and precious metals as the means to fundamentally control the dynamics of culture and society. In Northern Europe, societies were able to live well on rich food supplies from the marshlands, which had been created by the warmer climate. Other phenomena are the expansion of Megalithism, the appearance of the first significant economic stratification and the related first known monarchies in the Balkan region. Labour specialisation, economic stratification and possibly the risk of invasion may have been the reasons behind that development. From 2800 BC, the Danubian Seine-Oise-Marne culture pusheed directly or indirectly southwards and destroyed most of the rich Megalithic culture of western France.

The introduction of metallurgy which initiated unprecedented technological progress has also been linked with the establishment of social stratification and distinction between rich and poor and precious metals as the means to fundamentally control the dynamics of culture and society. In Northern Europe, societies were able to live well on rich food supplies from the marshlands, which had been created by the warmer climate. Other phenomena are the expansion of Megalithism, the appearance of the first significant economic stratification and the related first known monarchies in the Balkan region. Labour specialisation, economic stratification and possibly the risk of invasion may have been the reasons behind that development. From 2800 BC, the Danubian Seine-Oise-Marne culture pusheed directly or indirectly southwards and destroyed most of the rich Megalithic culture of western France.
