Later, the freshwater Lake Nemrut formed inside the caldera, becoming the world's second largest caldera lake. In this period it was suggested that the unusual structure of the watersheds in the region, and the very formation of Lake Van, is related to a large volcanic eruption and the blocking of the water discharge to Murat River by the lava flow. + Lakes within the caldera234px234px234pxIlı, eastern viewLake Nemrut, northeastern view ""Seasonal Lake""  Lake Nemrut  Lake Nemrut () is located in the south-western part of the caldera and is now a freshwater lake.

In winter, when less water is available from rivers and domestic energy consumption rises, Georgia experiences a deficit in electricity supplies, and imports energy from neighbouring countries. Water is transferred to a tunnel through a water intake located on the left bank of the reservoir creating a 130 m high asphalt faced-rockfill dam. From the reservoir, water is to be supplied into the headrace tunnel. Out of the created reservoir, 45.5 m/sec additional water is to be discharged into the Nenskra reservoir through a transfer tunnel allowing the Nenskra HPP to produce 1,219 GWh yearly. Tunnels  The Nakra transfer tunnel connects the Nakra valley with the Nenskra valley and is approximately 12.5 km long by 3.5 m in diameter and will divert water from behind the Nakra weir and into the Nenskra reservoir. The power unit will include the HPP powerhouse, tailrace for discharged water and GIS substation. Waste water will be discharged into the Nenskra river by tailrace. The dam will operate in the natural regime of the river through a bottom outlet to keep the water at the level of 1 370 m.
