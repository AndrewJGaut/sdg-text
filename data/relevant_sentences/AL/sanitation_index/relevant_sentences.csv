However, that is the so-called ""dead water"", which comes from the depth of  and has the temperature of only few Celsius degrees. Local population in the watershed of Temštica protested claiming that over 70% of the water was already taken out of Temštica which will result in an ecological catastrophe, especially in the canyon of Little Colorado. In protest, population of the village of Temska boycotted the Serbian parliamentary elections in January 2007.Politika, 22 January 2007, page 06 Due to the continued opposition from both the municipality and the population, the construction of the  long tunnel which would transfer the water from the river into the lake was abandoned. The water of Visočica is already being transferred into the lake, so the Temska relies only on waters from the Temštica. Transferring that water into the lake would make riverbeds downstream almost dry and lifeless. In the winter of 2017, the government announced that it will continue the construction of the tunnel, promising they will leave ""the minimal needed amount"" of water in the river. As reported by numerous media, the investors tend to build the objects even without all the necessary (or positive) permits and though they apply with projects of watermill hydro plants, which include mini reservoirs and constant flow of the streams, in the end they just conduct water into the pipes, drying the rivers out completely. The cause was supported by the musician Manu Chao who visited Topli Dol, giving an ad hoc performance and drinking water directly from the river. The Visočica is the source of the drinking water for the region and the habitat of the protected noble crayfish.

However, that is the so-called ""dead water"", which comes from the depth of  and has the temperature of only few Celsius degrees. Local population in the watershed of Temštica protested claiming that over 70% of the water was already taken out of Temštica which will result in an ecological catastrophe, especially in the canyon of Little Colorado. In protest, population of the village of Temska boycotted the Serbian parliamentary elections in January 2007.Politika, 22 January 2007, page 06 Due to the continued opposition from both the municipality and the population, the construction of the  long tunnel which would transfer the water from the river into the lake was abandoned. The water of Visočica is already being transferred into the lake, so the Temska relies only on waters from the Temštica. Transferring that water into the lake would make riverbeds downstream almost dry and lifeless. In the winter of 2017, the government announced that it will continue the construction of the tunnel, promising they will leave ""the minimal needed amount"" of water in the river. As reported by numerous media, the investors tend to build the objects even without all the necessary (or positive) permits and though they apply with projects of watermill hydro plants, which include mini reservoirs and constant flow of the streams, in the end they just conduct water into the pipes, drying the rivers out completely. The cause was supported by the musician Manu Chao who visited Topli Dol, giving an ad hoc performance and drinking water directly from the river. The Visočica is the source of the drinking water for the region and the habitat of the protected noble crayfish.
