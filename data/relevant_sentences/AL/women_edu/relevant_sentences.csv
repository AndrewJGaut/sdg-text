This mythic element says that the oracles at the oasis of Siwa in Libya and of Dodona in Epirus were equally old, but similarly transmitted by Phoenician culture, and that the seeresses – Herodotus does not say ""sibyls"" – were women. The element of the dove may be an attempt to account for a folk etymology applied to the archaic name of the sacred women that no longer made sense and the eventual connection with Zeus, justified by a tale told by a priestess. According to Strabo, the prophecies were originally uttered by men:  At the outset, it is true, those who uttered the prophecies were men (this too perhaps the poet indicates, for he calls them “hypophetae” [interpreters] and the prophets might be ranked among these), but later on three old women were designated as prophets, after Dione also had been designated as temple-associate of Zeus. Strabo also reports as uncertain the story that the predecessor of Dodona oracle was located in Thessaly:  ...the temple [oracle] was transferred from Thessaly, from the part of Pelasgia which is about Scotussa (and Scotussa does belong to the territory called Thessalia Pelasgiotis), and also that most of the women whose descendants are the prophetesses of today went along at the same time; and it is from this fact that Zeus was also called “Pelasgian.”  In a fragment of Strabo we find the following:Strabo. Among the Thesprotians and the Molossians old women are called ""peliai"" and old men ""pelioi,"" as is also the case among the Macedonians; at any rate, those people call their dignitaries ""peligones"" (compare the gerontesThis was the name of the senators at Sparta, meaning 'the elders'.

The neighbors were most impressed and their mother asked Hera to grant them the greatest gift. She had to be an older woman of blameless life chosen from among the peasants of the area. Python, who had been sent by Hera, had attempted to prevent Leto, while she was pregnant with Apollo and Artemis, from giving birth. Apollo killed Python but had to be punished for it, since he was a child of Gaia. Delphi was since ancient times a place of worship for Gaia, the mother goddess connected with fertility. The French author relates in a charming style his adventures on the road, praising particularly the ability of an old woman to put back in place the dislocated arm of one of his foreign traveling companions, who had fallen off the horse.

The neighbors were most impressed and their mother asked Hera to grant them the greatest gift. She had to be an older woman of blameless life chosen from among the peasants of the area. Python, who had been sent by Hera, had attempted to prevent Leto, while she was pregnant with Apollo and Artemis, from giving birth. Apollo killed Python but had to be punished for it, since he was a child of Gaia. Delphi was since ancient times a place of worship for Gaia, the mother goddess connected with fertility. The French author relates in a charming style his adventures on the road, praising particularly the ability of an old woman to put back in place the dislocated arm of one of his foreign traveling companions, who had fallen off the horse.

This mythic element says that the oracles at the oasis of Siwa in Libya and of Dodona in Epirus were equally old, but similarly transmitted by Phoenician culture, and that the seeresses – Herodotus does not say ""sibyls"" – were women. The element of the dove may be an attempt to account for a folk etymology applied to the archaic name of the sacred women that no longer made sense and the eventual connection with Zeus, justified by a tale told by a priestess. According to Strabo, the prophecies were originally uttered by men:  At the outset, it is true, those who uttered the prophecies were men (this too perhaps the poet indicates, for he calls them “hypophetae” [interpreters] and the prophets might be ranked among these), but later on three old women were designated as prophets, after Dione also had been designated as temple-associate of Zeus. Strabo also reports as uncertain the story that the predecessor of Dodona oracle was located in Thessaly:  ...the temple [oracle] was transferred from Thessaly, from the part of Pelasgia which is about Scotussa (and Scotussa does belong to the territory called Thessalia Pelasgiotis), and also that most of the women whose descendants are the prophetesses of today went along at the same time; and it is from this fact that Zeus was also called “Pelasgian.”  In a fragment of Strabo we find the following:Strabo. Among the Thesprotians and the Molossians old women are called ""peliai"" and old men ""pelioi,"" as is also the case among the Macedonians; at any rate, those people call their dignitaries ""peligones"" (compare the gerontesThis was the name of the senators at Sparta, meaning 'the elders'.

This mythic element says that the oracles at the oasis of Siwa in Libya and of Dodona in Epirus were equally old, but similarly transmitted by Phoenician culture, and that the seeresses – Herodotus does not say ""sibyls"" – were women. The element of the dove may be an attempt to account for a folk etymology applied to the archaic name of the sacred women that no longer made sense and the eventual connection with Zeus, justified by a tale told by a priestess. According to Strabo, the prophecies were originally uttered by men:  At the outset, it is true, those who uttered the prophecies were men (this too perhaps the poet indicates, for he calls them “hypophetae” [interpreters] and the prophets might be ranked among these), but later on three old women were designated as prophets, after Dione also had been designated as temple-associate of Zeus. Strabo also reports as uncertain the story that the predecessor of Dodona oracle was located in Thessaly:  ...the temple [oracle] was transferred from Thessaly, from the part of Pelasgia which is about Scotussa (and Scotussa does belong to the territory called Thessalia Pelasgiotis), and also that most of the women whose descendants are the prophetesses of today went along at the same time; and it is from this fact that Zeus was also called “Pelasgian.”  In a fragment of Strabo we find the following:Strabo. Among the Thesprotians and the Molossians old women are called ""peliai"" and old men ""pelioi,"" as is also the case among the Macedonians; at any rate, those people call their dignitaries ""peligones"" (compare the gerontesThis was the name of the senators at Sparta, meaning 'the elders'.

The statues commemorate their feat of pulling their mother's cart several miles to the Sanctuary of Hera in the absence of oxen. The neighbors were most impressed and their mother asked Hera to grant them the greatest gift. She had to be an older woman of blameless life chosen from among the peasants of the area.

This mythic element says that the oracles at the oasis of Siwa in Libya and of Dodona in Epirus were equally old, but similarly transmitted by Phoenician culture, and that the seeresses – Herodotus does not say ""sibyls"" – were women. The element of the dove may be an attempt to account for a folk etymology applied to the archaic name of the sacred women that no longer made sense and the eventual connection with Zeus, justified by a tale told by a priestess. According to Strabo, the prophecies were originally uttered by men:  At the outset, it is true, those who uttered the prophecies were men (this too perhaps the poet indicates, for he calls them “hypophetae” [interpreters] and the prophets might be ranked among these), but later on three old women were designated as prophets, after Dione also had been designated as temple-associate of Zeus. Strabo also reports as uncertain the story that the predecessor of Dodona oracle was located in Thessaly:  ...the temple [oracle] was transferred from Thessaly, from the part of Pelasgia which is about Scotussa (and Scotussa does belong to the territory called Thessalia Pelasgiotis), and also that most of the women whose descendants are the prophetesses of today went along at the same time; and it is from this fact that Zeus was also called “Pelasgian.”  In a fragment of Strabo we find the following:Strabo. Among the Thesprotians and the Molossians old women are called ""peliai"" and old men ""pelioi,"" as is also the case among the Macedonians; at any rate, those people call their dignitaries ""peligones"" (compare the gerontesThis was the name of the senators at Sparta, meaning 'the elders'.

The statues commemorate their feat of pulling their mother's cart several miles to the Sanctuary of Hera in the absence of oxen. The neighbors were most impressed and their mother asked Hera to grant them the greatest gift. She had to be an older woman of blameless life chosen from among the peasants of the area.

Apollo killed Python but had to be punished for it, since he was a child of Gaia. Delphi was since ancient times a place of worship for Gaia, the mother goddess connected with fertility. The French author relates in a charming style his adventures on the road, praising particularly the ability of an old woman to put back in place the dislocated arm of one of his foreign traveling companions, who had fallen off the horse.

This mythic element says that the oracles at the oasis of Siwa in Libya and of Dodona in Epirus were equally old, but similarly transmitted by Phoenician culture, and that the seeresses – Herodotus does not say ""sibyls"" – were women. The element of the dove may be an attempt to account for a folk etymology applied to the archaic name of the sacred women that no longer made sense and the eventual connection with Zeus, justified by a tale told by a priestess. According to Strabo, the prophecies were originally uttered by men:  At the outset, it is true, those who uttered the prophecies were men (this too perhaps the poet indicates, for he calls them “hypophetae” [interpreters] and the prophets might be ranked among these), but later on three old women were designated as prophets, after Dione also had been designated as temple-associate of Zeus. Strabo also reports as uncertain the story that the predecessor of Dodona oracle was located in Thessaly:  ...the temple [oracle] was transferred from Thessaly, from the part of Pelasgia which is about Scotussa (and Scotussa does belong to the territory called Thessalia Pelasgiotis), and also that most of the women whose descendants are the prophetesses of today went along at the same time; and it is from this fact that Zeus was also called “Pelasgian.”  In a fragment of Strabo we find the following:Strabo. Among the Thesprotians and the Molossians old women are called ""peliai"" and old men ""pelioi,"" as is also the case among the Macedonians; at any rate, those people call their dignitaries ""peligones"" (compare the gerontesThis was the name of the senators at Sparta, meaning 'the elders'.

This mythic element says that the oracles at the oasis of Siwa in Libya and of Dodona in Epirus were equally old, but similarly transmitted by Phoenician culture, and that the seeresses – Herodotus does not say ""sibyls"" – were women. The element of the dove may be an attempt to account for a folk etymology applied to the archaic name of the sacred women that no longer made sense and the eventual connection with Zeus, justified by a tale told by a priestess. According to Strabo, the prophecies were originally uttered by men:  At the outset, it is true, those who uttered the prophecies were men (this too perhaps the poet indicates, for he calls them “hypophetae” [interpreters] and the prophets might be ranked among these), but later on three old women were designated as prophets, after Dione also had been designated as temple-associate of Zeus. Strabo also reports as uncertain the story that the predecessor of Dodona oracle was located in Thessaly:  ...the temple [oracle] was transferred from Thessaly, from the part of Pelasgia which is about Scotussa (and Scotussa does belong to the territory called Thessalia Pelasgiotis), and also that most of the women whose descendants are the prophetesses of today went along at the same time; and it is from this fact that Zeus was also called “Pelasgian.”  In a fragment of Strabo we find the following:Strabo. Among the Thesprotians and the Molossians old women are called ""peliai"" and old men ""pelioi,"" as is also the case among the Macedonians; at any rate, those people call their dignitaries ""peligones"" (compare the gerontesThis was the name of the senators at Sparta, meaning 'the elders'.

This mythic element says that the oracles at the oasis of Siwa in Libya and of Dodona in Epirus were equally old, but similarly transmitted by Phoenician culture, and that the seeresses – Herodotus does not say ""sibyls"" – were women. The element of the dove may be an attempt to account for a folk etymology applied to the archaic name of the sacred women that no longer made sense and the eventual connection with Zeus, justified by a tale told by a priestess. According to Strabo, the prophecies were originally uttered by men:  At the outset, it is true, those who uttered the prophecies were men (this too perhaps the poet indicates, for he calls them “hypophetae” [interpreters] and the prophets might be ranked among these), but later on three old women were designated as prophets, after Dione also had been designated as temple-associate of Zeus. Strabo also reports as uncertain the story that the predecessor of Dodona oracle was located in Thessaly:  ...the temple [oracle] was transferred from Thessaly, from the part of Pelasgia which is about Scotussa (and Scotussa does belong to the territory called Thessalia Pelasgiotis), and also that most of the women whose descendants are the prophetesses of today went along at the same time; and it is from this fact that Zeus was also called “Pelasgian.”  In a fragment of Strabo we find the following:Strabo. Among the Thesprotians and the Molossians old women are called ""peliai"" and old men ""pelioi,"" as is also the case among the Macedonians; at any rate, those people call their dignitaries ""peligones"" (compare the gerontesThis was the name of the senators at Sparta, meaning 'the elders'.

The statues commemorate their feat of pulling their mother's cart several miles to the Sanctuary of Hera in the absence of oxen. The neighbors were most impressed and their mother asked Hera to grant them the greatest gift. She had to be an older woman of blameless life chosen from among the peasants of the area.

This mythic element says that the oracles at the oasis of Siwa in Libya and of Dodona in Epirus were equally old, but similarly transmitted by Phoenician culture, and that the seeresses – Herodotus does not say ""sibyls"" – were women. The element of the dove may be an attempt to account for a folk etymology applied to the archaic name of the sacred women that no longer made sense and the eventual connection with Zeus, justified by a tale told by a priestess. According to Strabo, the prophecies were originally uttered by men:  At the outset, it is true, those who uttered the prophecies were men (this too perhaps the poet indicates, for he calls them “hypophetae” [interpreters] and the prophets might be ranked among these), but later on three old women were designated as prophets, after Dione also had been designated as temple-associate of Zeus. Strabo also reports as uncertain the story that the predecessor of Dodona oracle was located in Thessaly:  ...the temple [oracle] was transferred from Thessaly, from the part of Pelasgia which is about Scotussa (and Scotussa does belong to the territory called Thessalia Pelasgiotis), and also that most of the women whose descendants are the prophetesses of today went along at the same time; and it is from this fact that Zeus was also called “Pelasgian.”  In a fragment of Strabo we find the following:Strabo. Among the Thesprotians and the Molossians old women are called ""peliai"" and old men ""pelioi,"" as is also the case among the Macedonians; at any rate, those people call their dignitaries ""peligones"" (compare the gerontesThis was the name of the senators at Sparta, meaning 'the elders'.

This mythic element says that the oracles at the oasis of Siwa in Libya and of Dodona in Epirus were equally old, but similarly transmitted by Phoenician culture, and that the seeresses – Herodotus does not say ""sibyls"" – were women. The element of the dove may be an attempt to account for a folk etymology applied to the archaic name of the sacred women that no longer made sense and the eventual connection with Zeus, justified by a tale told by a priestess. According to Strabo, the prophecies were originally uttered by men:  At the outset, it is true, those who uttered the prophecies were men (this too perhaps the poet indicates, for he calls them “hypophetae” [interpreters] and the prophets might be ranked among these), but later on three old women were designated as prophets, after Dione also had been designated as temple-associate of Zeus. Strabo also reports as uncertain the story that the predecessor of Dodona oracle was located in Thessaly:  ...the temple [oracle] was transferred from Thessaly, from the part of Pelasgia which is about Scotussa (and Scotussa does belong to the territory called Thessalia Pelasgiotis), and also that most of the women whose descendants are the prophetesses of today went along at the same time; and it is from this fact that Zeus was also called “Pelasgian.”  In a fragment of Strabo we find the following:Strabo. Among the Thesprotians and the Molossians old women are called ""peliai"" and old men ""pelioi,"" as is also the case among the Macedonians; at any rate, those people call their dignitaries ""peligones"" (compare the gerontesThis was the name of the senators at Sparta, meaning 'the elders'.
