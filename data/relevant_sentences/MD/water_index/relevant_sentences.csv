highlands where they established hilltop villages interspersed among the existing Vazimba settlements, which were ruled by local kings', ' The tombs of at least four Vazimba are located on or around Ambohimanga hill and are sites of pilgrimage, including the tombs of Ingorikelisahiloza, Andriantsidonina, Ramomba and Kotosarotra', ' In the mid-16th century the disparate Merina principalities were united as the Kingdom of Imerina under the rule of King Andriamanelo (1540–1575), who initiated military campaigns to expel or assimilate the Vazimba population', ' Conflict with the Vazimba led Andriamanelo to fortify his hill town using earthen walls, stone gateways and deep defensive trenches', ' This fortified town model, called a rova, was propagated by the noble class throughout Imerina until French colonization of Madagascar in 1895', '  The earliest settlement at the height of Ambohimanga was most likely established in the 15th century, coinciding with the arrival of the Merina in

system introduced through the astrology of seafaring Arabs governed the spiritual order and placed special significance on the northeast', ' The sacred eastern portions of Ambohimanga contained structures associated with the veneration of the ancestors, including the royal tombs, basins of holy water used in royal rituals, and numerous Ficus and Draceana trees, which were symbolic of royalty', ' The northern portion of the site is the location of a courtyard where royal judgments were handed down from atop a prominent granite boulder, in line with the Malagasy association between the northern cardinal point, masculinity, and political power', ' The houses of the royal wives were formerly located in the southern portion of the site, a cardinal point traditionally associated with femininity and spiritual power', "" These competing cosmological systems are also reflected in the placement of the city's main gates at cardinal points, as well as the northeastern gates

city, the rova at Antananarivo, which likewise embodies both traditional notions of space"", ' The placement of the city of Ambohimanga relative to Antananarivo also reflects these systems', "" Centrally located Antananarivo is the nation's political capital today, and Ambohimanga to its northeast is regarded as the spiritual capital"", '  Between these two systems, that of the political order predominates in the layout of Ambohimanga, and the sacredness of the city was historically more explicitly associated with its role as a political rather than an astrological center', ' The forbidding of foreigners from the site in the 19th century, for instance, was enacted to preserve the sanctity of the social and political order, rather than the religious order', ' By respecting these systems of symbolism, successive rulers sought to ensure the benediction of the ancestors, strengthen the legitimacy of their rule and ensure the protection and stability of their kingdom', ' However, adherence to cardinal division and symbolism of space is weaker at Ambohimanga than its embodiment of the significance of vertical space and elevation as an indicator of rank', ' The site of

a launching point for military offensives in his war against the Vazimba"", ' Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana was the first to systematically establish a network of defenses around the hilltop settlement', ' This first king of Ambohimanga dug trenches around his Bevato compound, which was initially only accessible through a gateway he named Ambavahadikely', '  The settlement was expanded by the construction of trenches bordering a second adjoining space to the northeast with two additional access points named Ampanidinamporona and Ambavahaditsiombiomby, the latter a natural gateway formed by two boulders', ' This latter entrance was most likely used to access the space even before the formal establishment of a royal city there, and is therefore considered by archaeologists to be the oldest gateway at the site', "" After the establishment of the rova, this entrance was reserved for use by the sovereign, a reflection of the spiritual significance of the northeastern direction and its association with the ancestors, whose benediction and hasina provided the basis for the sovereign's power and legitimacy"", ' It was also used to bring sacrificial cattle into the compound', ' Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana then expanded toward the west to a series of natural defenses, including stony cliffs and steep forested slopes that obviated the need to dig defensive trenches, and he constructed several additional gates that he named Ambavahadimahazaza, Andranomboahangy and Ambavahadiantandranomasina', ' Andrianampoinimerina expanded the trenches around the city using fanampoana labor', ' During his reign, a trench was dug that entirely encircles the hill, and a series of trenches was dug alongside existing ones to further protect the city against enemies', ' The current

exterior and interior walls"", ' Until French colonization in 1897 and at least as early as the reign of Radama I, foreigners and non-residents were not allowed to enter the royal city without authorization from the sovereign', '  The royal compound can be accessed through fourteen stone gateways in total', "" In addition to the inner seven gateways constructed by Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana in the early 18th century, there exists an exterior wall and second set of seven gates that were built before 1794 during the reign of Andrianampoinimerina, an act that

of the site; the second gateway for corpses was called Amboara', ' The stone disk at the southern Andranomatsatso gateway is also in good condition', ' This gateway, as well as Antsolatra and Ampitsaharana, were primarily used as lookout points', ' In the late 18th century Andrianampoinimerina replaced the Ambavahadiantandranomasina gate with another made of wood instead of stone and renamed it Ambavahadimasina', ' He and his successors shaved a small piece of wood from this lintel to light the sacred hearth fire that played a ritual role in the traditional circumcision ceremony', ' The red soil inside the gate and a series of wooden boards that paneled the approach to the gate were both considered sacred, and soldiers or others who anticipated a voyage away from Imerina would take handfuls of the soil and pieces of the wooden boards with them before departing in the belief that it would ensure their safe return', '  Several large stones are set in the ground near gates or at points outside the walls of Ambohimanga', ' Rulers would stand atop these stones, each identified by distinct names, to deliver speeches to the public', ' To the south were the stones called Ambatomasina and Ambatomenaloha, while Ambatorangotina was situated to the northwest', "" The latter stone was of particular importance: here the twelve leaders of the Ambatofotsy clan first declared

Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana and his 12 wives', ' Another account states that Manatsarakely was inhabited by Andrianjafy and later by the wives of Andrianampoinimerina; this house and Mahitsielafanjaka were renovated under Ranavalona I using wood from the region of Sihanaka to repanel the walls', '  Oral history credits Andrianampoinimerina with the construction of a second pair of houses in the compound', ' Beginning with his reign, Bevato became the second most important compound after Mahandrihono and enclosed four houses for royal wives and their servants', ' He also kept the royal idol Ifantaka here in a small house surrounded by a wooden palisade, which remained until the Christian convert Ranavalona II symbolically destroyed the royal idols in a bonfire in 1869', ' After removing the historic Tsararay in the Mahandrihono compound, Andrianampoinimerina built a new house with the same name in the Bevato compound', ' Tsararay was the residence of his wives when
