ID-2003-4#-14723521,1.0,"The mansion also served as a space that empowered women. In a 1936 newspaper section called ""Women's interests"", an article written by a lady who expressed her deep impressions of the mansion. In her account, women regularly served as joint hosts with their husbands in various social functions. This is contrasted starkly against the fact that women were, at the same time banned from other areas like the ""sacred precincts of the Swimming club"". In a time of patriarchy, such a role could be seen as an example where women were not mere inert members of society, but active ones who made good use of their agency. The writer also listed the various women who attended social gatherings, often with descriptions of how they gracefully conducted themselves. In one occasion, the author even praised the musical skills of a female guest. The mansion thus served as a site where women could find their voice and express themselves – notions which are often elusive in male-dominated histories. Moreover, the World Buddhist Society also served as the umbrella organization for the World Buddhist College, an educational institution which, according to newspaper reports, aimed to ""train all Buddhist monks in Singapore"". Taken as a whole, the mansion could thus be said to be a nexus that played an educational role, and where transnational linkages were forged between Buddhist societies worldwide."

In a 1936 newspaper section called ""Women's interests"", an article written by a lady who expressed her deep impressions of the mansion. In her account, women regularly served as joint hosts with their husbands in various social functions. This is contrasted starkly against the fact that women were, at the same time banned from other areas like the ""sacred precincts of the Swimming club"". In a time of patriarchy, such a role could be seen as an example where women were not mere inert members of society, but active ones who made good use of their agency. The writer also listed the various women who attended social gatherings, often with descriptions of how they gracefully conducted themselves. In one occasion, the author even praised the musical skills of a female guest. The mansion thus served as a site where women could find their voice and express themselves – notions which are often elusive in male-dominated histories. Moreover, the World Buddhist Society also served as the umbrella organization for the World Buddhist College, an educational institution which, according to newspaper reports, aimed to ""train all Buddhist monks in Singapore"".

In a 1936 newspaper section called ""Women's interests"", an article written by a lady who expressed her deep impressions of the mansion. In her account, women regularly served as joint hosts with their husbands in various social functions. This is contrasted starkly against the fact that women were, at the same time banned from other areas like the ""sacred precincts of the Swimming club"". In a time of patriarchy, such a role could be seen as an example where women were not mere inert members of society, but active ones who made good use of their agency. The writer also listed the various women who attended social gatherings, often with descriptions of how they gracefully conducted themselves. In one occasion, the author even praised the musical skills of a female guest. The mansion thus served as a site where women could find their voice and express themselves – notions which are often elusive in male-dominated histories. Moreover, the World Buddhist Society also served as the umbrella organization for the World Buddhist College, an educational institution which, according to newspaper reports, aimed to ""train all Buddhist monks in Singapore"". Taken as a whole, the mansion could thus be said to be a nexus that played an educational role, and where transnational linkages were forged between Buddhist societies worldwide."

In a 1936 newspaper section called ""Women's interests"", an article written by a lady who expressed her deep impressions of the mansion. In her account, women regularly served as joint hosts with their husbands in various social functions. This is contrasted starkly against the fact that women were, at the same time banned from other areas like the ""sacred precincts of the Swimming club"". In a time of patriarchy, such a role could be seen as an example where women were not mere inert members of society, but active ones who made good use of their agency. The writer also listed the various women who attended social gatherings, often with descriptions of how they gracefully conducted themselves. In one occasion, the author even praised the musical skills of a female guest. The mansion thus served as a site where women could find their voice and express themselves – notions which are often elusive in male-dominated histories. Moreover, the World Buddhist Society also served as the umbrella organization for the World Buddhist College, an educational institution which, according to newspaper reports, aimed to ""train all Buddhist monks in Singapore"".

In a 1936 newspaper section called ""Women's interests"", an article written by a lady who expressed her deep impressions of the mansion. In her account, women regularly served as joint hosts with their husbands in various social functions. This is contrasted starkly against the fact that women were, at the same time banned from other areas like the ""sacred precincts of the Swimming club"". In a time of patriarchy, such a role could be seen as an example where women were not mere inert members of society, but active ones who made good use of their agency. The writer also listed the various women who attended social gatherings, often with descriptions of how they gracefully conducted themselves. In one occasion, the author even praised the musical skills of a female guest. The mansion thus served as a site where women could find their voice and express themselves – notions which are often elusive in male-dominated histories. Moreover, the World Buddhist Society also served as the umbrella organization for the World Buddhist College, an educational institution which, according to newspaper reports, aimed to ""train all Buddhist monks in Singapore"". Taken as a whole, the mansion could thus be said to be a nexus that played an educational role, and where transnational linkages were forged between Buddhist societies worldwide."

ID-2003-4#-14723521,1.0,"The mansion also served as a space that empowered women. In a 1936 newspaper section called ""Women's interests"", an article written by a lady who expressed her deep impressions of the mansion. In her account, women regularly served as joint hosts with their husbands in various social functions. This is contrasted starkly against the fact that women were, at the same time banned from other areas like the ""sacred precincts of the Swimming club"". In a time of patriarchy, such a role could be seen as an example where women were not mere inert members of society, but active ones who made good use of their agency. The writer also listed the various women who attended social gatherings, often with descriptions of how they gracefully conducted themselves. In one occasion, the author even praised the musical skills of a female guest. The mansion thus served as a site where women could find their voice and express themselves – notions which are often elusive in male-dominated histories. Moreover, the World Buddhist Society also served as the umbrella organization for the World Buddhist College, an educational institution which, according to newspaper reports, aimed to ""train all Buddhist monks in Singapore"". Taken as a whole, the mansion could thus be said to be a nexus that played an educational role, and where transnational linkages were forged between Buddhist societies worldwide."

ID-2003-4#-14723521,1.0,"The mansion also served as a space that empowered women. In a 1936 newspaper section called ""Women's interests"", an article written by a lady who expressed her deep impressions of the mansion. In her account, women regularly served as joint hosts with their husbands in various social functions. This is contrasted starkly against the fact that women were, at the same time banned from other areas like the ""sacred precincts of the Swimming club"". In a time of patriarchy, such a role could be seen as an example where women were not mere inert members of society, but active ones who made good use of their agency. The writer also listed the various women who attended social gatherings, often with descriptions of how they gracefully conducted themselves. In one occasion, the author even praised the musical skills of a female guest. The mansion thus served as a site where women could find their voice and express themselves – notions which are often elusive in male-dominated histories. Moreover, the World Buddhist Society also served as the umbrella organization for the World Buddhist College, an educational institution which, according to newspaper reports, aimed to ""train all Buddhist monks in Singapore"". Taken as a whole, the mansion could thus be said to be a nexus that played an educational role, and where transnational linkages were forged between Buddhist societies worldwide."

History MSS was inaugurated as a result of a shortage of secondary schools, especially in anticipation of the record number of primary-school leavers in January 2000. and acquisition of land at the current site began shortly after the decision to establish the school. Primary-school leavers had little interest in choosing MSS at first, compared with the long-established secondary schools in Woodlands. MSS was involved in the three-year Apple-MOE Collaboration in which Apple Inc.'s Macintosh computers were introduced, and the education model used in the United States devised by educators and Apple Inc. was applied.

In a 1936 newspaper section called ""Women's interests"", an article written by a lady who expressed her deep impressions of the mansion. In her account, women regularly served as joint hosts with their husbands in various social functions. This is contrasted starkly against the fact that women were, at the same time banned from other areas like the ""sacred precincts of the Swimming club"". In a time of patriarchy, such a role could be seen as an example where women were not mere inert members of society, but active ones who made good use of their agency. The writer also listed the various women who attended social gatherings, often with descriptions of how they gracefully conducted themselves. In one occasion, the author even praised the musical skills of a female guest. The mansion thus served as a site where women could find their voice and express themselves – notions which are often elusive in male-dominated histories. Moreover, the World Buddhist Society also served as the umbrella organization for the World Buddhist College, an educational institution which, according to newspaper reports, aimed to ""train all Buddhist monks in Singapore"".

History MSS was inaugurated as a result of a shortage of secondary schools, especially in anticipation of the record number of primary-school leavers in January 2000. and acquisition of land at the current site began shortly after the decision to establish the school. Primary-school leavers had little interest in choosing MSS at first, compared with the long-established secondary schools in Woodlands. MSS was involved in the three-year Apple-MOE Collaboration in which Apple Inc.'s Macintosh computers were introduced, and the education model used in the United States devised by educators and Apple Inc. was applied. During this period, MSS hosted three Edu-Pi camps, a two-day educational workshop to encourage the use of Apple Inc.'s products such as iMovie and the Mac OS. Merger MSS merged with Si Ling Secondary School with effect from 1 January 2017 due to its small student population. The abbreviation of the school changed from MSL to MSS.

In a 1936 newspaper section called ""Women's interests"", an article written by a lady who expressed her deep impressions of the mansion. In her account, women regularly served as joint hosts with their husbands in various social functions. This is contrasted starkly against the fact that women were, at the same time banned from other areas like the ""sacred precincts of the Swimming club"". In a time of patriarchy, such a role could be seen as an example where women were not mere inert members of society, but active ones who made good use of their agency. The writer also listed the various women who attended social gatherings, often with descriptions of how they gracefully conducted themselves. In one occasion, the author even praised the musical skills of a female guest. The mansion thus served as a site where women could find their voice and express themselves – notions which are often elusive in male-dominated histories. Moreover, the World Buddhist Society also served as the umbrella organization for the World Buddhist College, an educational institution which, according to newspaper reports, aimed to ""train all Buddhist monks in Singapore"".

In a 1936 newspaper section called ""Women's interests"", an article written by a lady who expressed her deep impressions of the mansion. In her account, women regularly served as joint hosts with their husbands in various social functions. This is contrasted starkly against the fact that women were, at the same time banned from other areas like the ""sacred precincts of the Swimming club"". In a time of patriarchy, such a role could be seen as an example where women were not mere inert members of society, but active ones who made good use of their agency. The writer also listed the various women who attended social gatherings, often with descriptions of how they gracefully conducted themselves. In one occasion, the author even praised the musical skills of a female guest. The mansion thus served as a site where women could find their voice and express themselves – notions which are often elusive in male-dominated histories. Moreover, the World Buddhist Society also served as the umbrella organization for the World Buddhist College, an educational institution which, according to newspaper reports, aimed to ""train all Buddhist monks in Singapore"".
