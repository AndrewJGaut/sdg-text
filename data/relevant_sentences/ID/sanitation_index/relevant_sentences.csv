The hillsides were typical of tropical climate; large flocks of parrots, monkeys in great variety, wild-mango and orange groves—a superb scene of plants and flowers of every description, glowing in vivid tints of purple, red, blue, brown, and green—but not water or provisions. A new island volcano rose above the waterline a few days later.

If the project goes ahead as planned, it would join the list of the world's most expensive transport infrastructure. One of the various possible designs that has been mentioned involves a project of around 27 km in length with the following sections alternating across land and water:Details are from Hans David Tampubolon, 'Sunda Strait Bridge left in lurch by Cabinet split',The Jakarta Post, 25 July 2012. Development of infrastructure associated with the bridge (such as the Panimbang – Serang toll road, South Banten airport, Bojonegoro container port, and the Cilegon – Bojonegoro 14 km toll road). Financing It is not yet clear how such expensive infrastructure would be paid for. This reflects the current interest in Indonesia in the use of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) for investments in infrastructure.A summary of some of the issues involved in PPP policy in Indonesia can be found at Harun al-Rasyid Lubis, 'Public-private partnership infrastructure market in RI', The Jakarta Post, 26 October 2011. Some commentators have argued that the funds could be better used for other urgent infrastructure projects. Technical issues Access to and use of land for infrastructure activities often gives rise to disagreements in Indonesia. Some proponents of the bridge also point to safety and associated water traffic considerations which they argue point to the need for a bridge. The management of water traffic is complicated by the need to accommodate two major flows of traffic running east-west and north-south."

Health effects; included emergency room visits due to respiratory symptoms such as asthma, upper respiratory infection, decreased lung function as well as eye and skin irritation, were caused mainly by this particulate matter. The smoke haze episode has added to the urban and industrial air pollution in Southeast Asia, causing it to reach alarming levels in many metropolitan areas.

The hillsides were typical of tropical climate; large flocks of parrots, monkeys in great variety, wild-mango and orange groves—a superb scene of plants and flowers of every description, glowing in vivid tints of purple, red, blue, brown, and green—but not water or provisions. A new island volcano rose above the waterline a few days later. Eventually, a fourth island, named Anak Krakatau (meaning ""child of Krakatoa"" in Indonesian), broke water in August 1930 and produced lava flows more quickly than the waves could erode them.

Health effects; included emergency room visits due to respiratory symptoms such as asthma, upper respiratory infection, decreased lung function as well as eye and skin irritation, were caused mainly by this particulate matter. The smoke haze episode has added to the urban and industrial air pollution in Southeast Asia, causing it to reach alarming levels in many metropolitan areas.

Hot springs boiling furiously up, through many fathoms of water, were found on the eastern side of Krakatoa,  from the shore. Roberts, Captain Geisinger, and marine lieutenant Fowler visited Forsaken island, having mistaken the singing of locusts for the sound of running water. The boat glided over crystal clear water, over an extensive and highly beautiful submarine garden. The hillsides were typical of tropical climate; large flocks of parrots, monkeys in great variety, wild-mango and orange groves—a superb scene of plants and flowers of every description, glowing in vivid tints of purple, red, blue, brown, and green—but not water or provisions. A new island volcano rose above the waterline a few days later. Eventually, a fourth island, named Anak Krakatau (meaning ""child of Krakatoa"" in Indonesian), broke water in August 1930 and produced lava flows more quickly than the waves could erode them. Handl found un-burned wood below the 1883 ash deposits while digging, and fresh water was found below ."

Hot springs boiling furiously up, through many fathoms of water, were found on the eastern side of Krakatoa,  from the shore. Roberts, Captain Geisinger, and marine lieutenant Fowler visited Forsaken island, having mistaken the singing of locusts for the sound of running water. The boat glided over crystal clear water, over an extensive and highly beautiful submarine garden. The hillsides were typical of tropical climate; large flocks of parrots, monkeys in great variety, wild-mango and orange groves—a superb scene of plants and flowers of every description, glowing in vivid tints of purple, red, blue, brown, and green—but not water or provisions. A new island volcano rose above the waterline a few days later. Eventually, a fourth island, named Anak Krakatau (meaning ""child of Krakatoa"" in Indonesian), broke water in August 1930 and produced lava flows more quickly than the waves could erode them. Handl found un-burned wood below the 1883 ash deposits while digging, and fresh water was found below ."

Health effects; included emergency room visits due to respiratory symptoms such as asthma, upper respiratory infection, decreased lung function as well as eye and skin irritation, were caused mainly by this particulate matter. The smoke haze episode has added to the urban and industrial air pollution in Southeast Asia, causing it to reach alarming levels in many metropolitan areas. By scattering and absorbing light, the fire-related particulate also resulted in reduced visibility; impairing transportation by air, land and water and seriously affecting the economies of Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. Fire-related smoke haze episodes also reveal a social component: a large part of the population in Southeast Asia do not have the financial means to buy protective measures such as respiratory masks and air conditioning, nor are they able to refrain from outdoor work when air pollution is high.

Financing It is not yet clear how such expensive infrastructure would be paid for. This reflects the current interest in Indonesia in the use of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) for investments in infrastructure.A summary of some of the issues involved in PPP policy in Indonesia can be found at Harun al-Rasyid Lubis, 'Public-private partnership infrastructure market in RI', The Jakarta Post, 26 October 2011. Some commentators have argued that the funds could be better used for other urgent infrastructure projects. Technical issues Access to and use of land for infrastructure activities often gives rise to disagreements in Indonesia. Some proponents of the bridge also point to safety and associated water traffic considerations which they argue point to the need for a bridge.

Development of infrastructure associated with the bridge (such as the Panimbang – Serang toll road, South Banten airport, Bojonegoro container port, and the Cilegon – Bojonegoro 14 km toll road). Financing It is not yet clear how such expensive infrastructure would be paid for. This reflects the current interest in Indonesia in the use of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) for investments in infrastructure.A summary of some of the issues involved in PPP policy in Indonesia can be found at Harun al-Rasyid Lubis, 'Public-private partnership infrastructure market in RI', The Jakarta Post, 26 October 2011. Some commentators have argued that the funds could be better used for other urgent infrastructure projects. Technical issues Access to and use of land for infrastructure activities often gives rise to disagreements in Indonesia. Some proponents of the bridge also point to safety and associated water traffic considerations which they argue point to the need for a bridge. The management of water traffic is complicated by the need to accommodate two major flows of traffic running east-west and north-south."

If the project goes ahead as planned, it would join the list of the world's most expensive transport infrastructure. One of the various possible designs that has been mentioned involves a project of around 27 km in length with the following sections alternating across land and water:Details are from Hans David Tampubolon, 'Sunda Strait Bridge left in lurch by Cabinet split',The Jakarta Post, 25 July 2012. Development of infrastructure associated with the bridge (such as the Panimbang – Serang toll road, South Banten airport, Bojonegoro container port, and the Cilegon – Bojonegoro 14 km toll road). Financing It is not yet clear how such expensive infrastructure would be paid for. This reflects the current interest in Indonesia in the use of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) for investments in infrastructure.A summary of some of the issues involved in PPP policy in Indonesia can be found at Harun al-Rasyid Lubis, 'Public-private partnership infrastructure market in RI', The Jakarta Post, 26 October 2011. Some commentators have argued that the funds could be better used for other urgent infrastructure projects. Technical issues Access to and use of land for infrastructure activities often gives rise to disagreements in Indonesia. Some proponents of the bridge also point to safety and associated water traffic considerations which they argue point to the need for a bridge. The management of water traffic is complicated by the need to accommodate two major flows of traffic running east-west and north-south."

If the project goes ahead as planned, it would join the list of the world's most expensive transport infrastructure. One of the various possible designs that has been mentioned involves a project of around 27 km in length with the following sections alternating across land and water:Details are from Hans David Tampubolon, 'Sunda Strait Bridge left in lurch by Cabinet split',The Jakarta Post, 25 July 2012. Development of infrastructure associated with the bridge (such as the Panimbang – Serang toll road, South Banten airport, Bojonegoro container port, and the Cilegon – Bojonegoro 14 km toll road). Financing It is not yet clear how such expensive infrastructure would be paid for. This reflects the current interest in Indonesia in the use of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) for investments in infrastructure.A summary of some of the issues involved in PPP policy in Indonesia can be found at Harun al-Rasyid Lubis, 'Public-private partnership infrastructure market in RI', The Jakarta Post, 26 October 2011. Some commentators have argued that the funds could be better used for other urgent infrastructure projects. Technical issues Access to and use of land for infrastructure activities often gives rise to disagreements in Indonesia. Some proponents of the bridge also point to safety and associated water traffic considerations which they argue point to the need for a bridge. The management of water traffic is complicated by the need to accommodate two major flows of traffic running east-west and north-south."

Technical issues Access to and use of land for infrastructure activities often gives rise to disagreements in Indonesia. Some proponents of the bridge also point to safety and associated water traffic considerations which they argue point to the need for a bridge.

Important issues include deforestation (with Indonesia recorded the largest loss of forest in the region, more than other member states combined in the 2001-2013 period), plastic waste dumping (5 member states were among the top 10 out of 192 countries based on 2010 data, with Indonesia ranked as second worst polluter), threatened mammal species (Indonesia ranked the worst in the region with 184 species under threat), threatened fish species (Indonesia ranked the worst in the region), threatened (higher) plant species (Malaysia ranked the worst in the region). Universities, both in terms of academic salaries and research infrastructure (libraries, laboratories), tend to be poorly supported financially. Governments have a vested interest in investing in education and other aspects of human capital infrastructure, especially rapidly developing countries in the region. In the longer term, investments in physical infrastructure, productivity enhancements, and provision of education and health services determine the potential for growth.Green, David. Some scholars think that non-interference has hindered ASEAN efforts to handle the Myanmar issue, human rights abuse, and haze pollution in the area."

If the project goes ahead as planned, it would join the list of the world's most expensive transport infrastructure. One of the various possible designs that has been mentioned involves a project of around 27 km in length with the following sections alternating across land and water:Details are from Hans David Tampubolon, 'Sunda Strait Bridge left in lurch by Cabinet split',The Jakarta Post, 25 July 2012. Development of infrastructure associated with the bridge (such as the Panimbang – Serang toll road, South Banten airport, Bojonegoro container port, and the Cilegon – Bojonegoro 14 km toll road). Financing It is not yet clear how such expensive infrastructure would be paid for. This reflects the current interest in Indonesia in the use of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) for investments in infrastructure.A summary of some of the issues involved in PPP policy in Indonesia can be found at Harun al-Rasyid Lubis, 'Public-private partnership infrastructure market in RI', The Jakarta Post, 26 October 2011. Some commentators have argued that the funds could be better used for other urgent infrastructure projects. Technical issues Access to and use of land for infrastructure activities often gives rise to disagreements in Indonesia. Some proponents of the bridge also point to safety and associated water traffic considerations which they argue point to the need for a bridge. The management of water traffic is complicated by the need to accommodate two major flows of traffic running east-west and north-south."

If the project goes ahead as planned, it would join the list of the world's most expensive transport infrastructure. One of the various possible designs that has been mentioned involves a project of around 27 km in length with the following sections alternating across land and water:Details are from Hans David Tampubolon, 'Sunda Strait Bridge left in lurch by Cabinet split',The Jakarta Post, 25 July 2012. Development of infrastructure associated with the bridge (such as the Panimbang – Serang toll road, South Banten airport, Bojonegoro container port, and the Cilegon – Bojonegoro 14 km toll road). Financing It is not yet clear how such expensive infrastructure would be paid for. This reflects the current interest in Indonesia in the use of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) for investments in infrastructure.A summary of some of the issues involved in PPP policy in Indonesia can be found at Harun al-Rasyid Lubis, 'Public-private partnership infrastructure market in RI', The Jakarta Post, 26 October 2011. Some commentators have argued that the funds could be better used for other urgent infrastructure projects. Technical issues Access to and use of land for infrastructure activities often gives rise to disagreements in Indonesia. Some proponents of the bridge also point to safety and associated water traffic considerations which they argue point to the need for a bridge. The management of water traffic is complicated by the need to accommodate two major flows of traffic running east-west and north-south."

Hot springs boiling furiously up, through many fathoms of water, were found on the eastern side of Krakatoa,  from the shore. Roberts, Captain Geisinger, and marine lieutenant Fowler visited Forsaken island, having mistaken the singing of locusts for the sound of running water. The boat glided over crystal clear water, over an extensive and highly beautiful submarine garden. The hillsides were typical of tropical climate; large flocks of parrots, monkeys in great variety, wild-mango and orange groves—a superb scene of plants and flowers of every description, glowing in vivid tints of purple, red, blue, brown, and green—but not water or provisions. A new island volcano rose above the waterline a few days later.

The smoke haze episode has added to the urban and industrial air pollution in Southeast Asia, causing it to reach alarming levels in many metropolitan areas.

Together these four pumps had to pump out 6,000 m3 of water in two hours in order to completely raise the dock. A system of tubes and valves made it possible to regulate the amount of water that remained in each compartment. By leaving more water in the compartments that were not 'under' the ship, less strain was put on the dock.

Together these four pumps had to pump out 6,000 m3 of water in two hours in order to completely raise the dock. A system of tubes and valves made it possible to regulate the amount of water that remained in each compartment. By leaving more water in the compartments that were not 'under' the ship, less strain was put on the dock. This was a trial run to establish that the dry dock was water tight, and that everything functioned. The valves were opened, and so it sank in 300 meter deep water."

ID-2003-4#-35781553,1.0,"At the time, the Noordhollandsch Kanaal was the only deep water connection from Amsterdam to the sea. In Le Havre such an economic limit to the length of the dock did not exist, and so the Havre Dock was much longer at 64 m. For Surabaya, this size limit was also not applicable, and like the dry dock in Le Havre, it would operate in salt water. She struck the reef with such force that within a few hours there was 5 feet of water inside the ship. That is, some water was let into the pit, and when the bottom was afloat, all support was removed. The water was then pumped out, and the coppered bottom of the drydock rested on the floor of the dockpit. The main difference is that wooden drydocks were basically rafts that were lowered by pumping water in and out of the superstructure on the sides. This is how the water 'chests' were formed. It was noted that even with the heaviest ships, the water on the outside was never so high. Operation  The dock, or rather the raft, was brought below the waterline by adding ballast to the sides. in the water compartments. Next, the communication between the outside water and the compartments was closed off, and the communication between the compartments and the pumps opened. The pumps then emptied the compartments, making that the dock rose, and most water inside the dock flowed off via the door. This continued till the lower, watertight part, of the door started to get above water. Next the communication between the compartments and the inside of the dock was opened, so the pumps could pump out the remaining water. The height of the water above the raft, that the door had to keep out was not that much. For contemporary frigates Oordt thought that the water would stay 80–90 cm above the raft of a suitable wooden dry dock. Dimensions  Surabaya dock had a length of 64 m, a beam of 20 m, was 7.5 m high and had a draft of 1.20 m. The draft of 1.20 m was an 'empty' draft, the dock would get lower by letting water into the sides. The dimensions of Surabaya dock did differ slightly from that of Le Havre, as it was 50 cm wider and higher, but was 10 cm higher in the water when empty. The guns, excess anchors and chains, iron water boxes, the upper rigging and all other heavy stores were removed. The efficiency of a drydock came from the speed with which it could service ships, whether for inspection, cleaning or maintenance. In Lassem / Rembang she would by put dry and receive maintenance, also on the parts below the waterline. In 1879 Surabaya Wooden Dock received new boilers, even though she continuously made a lot of water. The end  On 16 April 1881 Surabaya Wooden Dock of 1,100 tons, which continuously made a lot of water, was sold for break up."

A paraphrased account follows: On 8 September 1832, US sloop-of war Peacock anchored off the north end, also visiting Lang Island, in search of inhabitants, fresh water, and yams. Hot springs boiling furiously up, through many fathoms of water, were found on the eastern side of Krakatoa,  from the shore. Roberts, Captain Geisinger, and marine lieutenant Fowler visited Forsaken island, having mistaken the singing of locusts for the sound of running water. The boat glided over crystal clear water, over an extensive and highly beautiful submarine garden. The hillsides were typical of tropical climate; large flocks of parrots, monkeys in great variety, wild-mango and orange groves—a superb scene of plants and flowers of every description, glowing in vivid tints of purple, red, blue, brown, and green—but not water or provisions. A new island volcano rose above the waterline a few days later. Eventually, a fourth island, named Anak Krakatau (meaning ""child of Krakatoa"" in Indonesian), broke water in August 1930 and produced lava flows more quickly than the waves could erode them. Handl found un-burned wood below the 1883 ash deposits while digging, and fresh water was found below ."

Health effects; included emergency room visits due to respiratory symptoms such as asthma, upper respiratory infection, decreased lung function as well as eye and skin irritation, were caused mainly by this particulate matter. The smoke haze episode has added to the urban and industrial air pollution in Southeast Asia, causing it to reach alarming levels in many metropolitan areas. By scattering and absorbing light, the fire-related particulate also resulted in reduced visibility; impairing transportation by air, land and water and seriously affecting the economies of Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. Fire-related smoke haze episodes also reveal a social component: a large part of the population in Southeast Asia do not have the financial means to buy protective measures such as respiratory masks and air conditioning, nor are they able to refrain from outdoor work when air pollution is high.

Development of infrastructure associated with the bridge (such as the Panimbang – Serang toll road, South Banten airport, Bojonegoro container port, and the Cilegon – Bojonegoro 14 km toll road). Financing It is not yet clear how such expensive infrastructure would be paid for. This reflects the current interest in Indonesia in the use of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) for investments in infrastructure.A summary of some of the issues involved in PPP policy in Indonesia can be found at Harun al-Rasyid Lubis, 'Public-private partnership infrastructure market in RI', The Jakarta Post, 26 October 2011. Some commentators have argued that the funds could be better used for other urgent infrastructure projects. Technical issues Access to and use of land for infrastructure activities often gives rise to disagreements in Indonesia. Some proponents of the bridge also point to safety and associated water traffic considerations which they argue point to the need for a bridge. The management of water traffic is complicated by the need to accommodate two major flows of traffic running east-west and north-south."

When energy demand is high, water from the upper reservoir is sent to the power plant to produce electricity. When energy demand is low, water is pumped from the lower reservoir to the upper by the same pump-generators. The lower reservoir dam will trap water from a  catchment area to create a lake with a gross storage capacity of . The upper reservoir dam will trap water from a much smaller catchment area, , to create its reservoir with a gross storage capacity of  and surface area of . Surge tanks on each headrace tunnel help prevent water hammer. Each of these four penstocks will supply water to the turbines during power generation. After power generation the water will be discharged into the lower reservoir via four tailrace tunnels. When pumping water moves through the same conduits back to the upper reservoir."

Important issues include deforestation (with Indonesia recorded the largest loss of forest in the region, more than other member states combined in the 2001-2013 period), plastic waste dumping (5 member states were among the top 10 out of 192 countries based on 2010 data, with Indonesia ranked as second worst polluter), threatened mammal species (Indonesia ranked the worst in the region with 184 species under threat), threatened fish species (Indonesia ranked the worst in the region), threatened (higher) plant species (Malaysia ranked the worst in the region). Universities, both in terms of academic salaries and research infrastructure (libraries, laboratories), tend to be poorly supported financially. Governments have a vested interest in investing in education and other aspects of human capital infrastructure, especially rapidly developing countries in the region. In the longer term, investments in physical infrastructure, productivity enhancements, and provision of education and health services determine the potential for growth.Green, David. Some scholars think that non-interference has hindered ASEAN efforts to handle the Myanmar issue, human rights abuse, and haze pollution in the area."
