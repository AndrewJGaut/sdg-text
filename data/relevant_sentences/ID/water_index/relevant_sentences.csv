The Airlele river was said to originate from Buquet China (present-day Bukit Cina). A fortress was designed and constructed encompassing a hill, lining the edge of the sea shore, on the south east of the river mouth, on the former site of the Sultan's palace. The pentagonal system began at the farthest point of the cape near south east of the river mouth, towards the west of the Fortaleza. The one running northward toward the river mouth was 130 fathoms in length to the bastion of São Pedro while the other one ran for 75 fathoms to the east, curving inshore, ending at the gate and bastion of Santiago. The suburb was rectangular in shape, with a northern walled boundary, the straits of Malacca to the south and the river of Malacca (Rio de Malaca) and the fortaleza's wall to the east. A stone bridge with sentry crosses the river Malacca to provide access to the Malacca Fortress via the eastern Custome House Terrace.

The Airlele river was said to originate from Buquet China (present-day Bukit Cina). A fortress was designed and constructed encompassing a hill, lining the edge of the sea shore, on the south east of the river mouth, on the former site of the Sultan's palace. The pentagonal system began at the farthest point of the cape near south east of the river mouth, towards the west of the Fortaleza. The one running northward toward the river mouth was 130 fathoms in length to the bastion of São Pedro while the other one ran for 75 fathoms to the east, curving inshore, ending at the gate and bastion of Santiago. The suburb was rectangular in shape, with a northern walled boundary, the straits of Malacca to the south and the river of Malacca (Rio de Malaca) and the fortaleza's wall to the east. A stone bridge with sentry crosses the river Malacca to provide access to the Malacca Fortress via the eastern Custome House Terrace.

The original use of the dam had been to retain water for irrigation of rice paddies which were then replaced by urban development. People living near the dam had made complaints about leaks in the past and the dam actually breached in November 2008 but no damage was done. The dam was overtopped, eroding the dam surface and resulting in a breach  wide at around 2 am on 27 March local time (7 pm 26 March GMT).

ID-2003-4#-14721509,1.0,"Sovereignty over South Ledge belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located. The actions of the United Kingdom and Singapore in respect of the Horsburgh Lighthouse and the waters surrounding the island were not actions of the island's sovereign. As regards South Ledge, the Court noted that it falls within the apparently overlapping territorial waters generated by mainland Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. As it is a maritime feature visible only at low tide, it belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located. On 21 December 1979, the Director of National Mapping of Malaysia published a map entitled Territorial Waters and Continental Shelf Boundaries of Malaysia showing Pedra Branca to be within its territorial waters. Other significant acts included the following:  Singapore had investigated shipwrecks in the waters around the island between 1920 and 1979.Pedra Branca case, para. In addition, Singapore had on two occasions claimed the sea around Pedra Branca as its territorial waters. Subsequently, in 1967, the Singapore Government's Marine Department also stated in an official memorandum to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Singapore) that the waters within three miles of Pedra Branca might be considered Singapore territorial waters.Para. Additionally, Malaysia had not shown any exercise of sovereignty over the uninhabited reefs of Middle Rocks and South Ledge while Singapore had consistently exercised sovereign authority in the surrounding waters. Therefore, by investigating and reporting on shipwrecks and maritime hazards within Pedra Branca's territorial waters Singapore had acted in accordance with best practice and not à titre de souverain. Also, an internal confidential document dated 16 July 1968 entitled ""Letter of Promulgation"" by the Chief of the Royal Malaysian Navy included charts showing that Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge were within Malaysia's territorial waters,Pedra Branca case, para. 242. and the features were included within Malaysian fisheries waters in the Fisheries Act 1985. It further held, by 15 votes to one, that sovereignty over Middle Rocks belongs to Malaysia, and sovereignty over South Ledge belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located.Pedra Branca case, operative clause; . South Ledge falls within the apparently overlapping territorial waters generated by the mainland of Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. Although in the Special Agreement and in their final submissions Malaysia and Singapore had asked the Court to decide which state had sovereignty over Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge, the Court had not been mandated to delimit the extent of the territorial waters of the two states in the area in question. Therefore, it simply held that South Ledge, as a low-tide elevation, belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located.Pedra Branca case, paras. Malaysia On the day the ICJ released its judgment, Rais Yatim asserted that since South Ledge was within the territorial waters of Middle Rocks, ""Malaysia appears to be the sovereign holder"".. A week later, the Foreign Ministry of Malaysia asked the Malaysian media to cease using the Malay word Pulau (""Island"") for Pedra Branca and to refer to it as ""Batu Puteh"" or ""Pedra Branca"".. Nonetheless, Malaysian agencies have taken up efforts to stake claims over a hundred islands, reefs, rocks and other features in the South China Sea, Malacca Straits, and off Sabahan waters that Malaysia could lose to China, Indonesia and Vietnam.. Two of these islands are Pulau Unarang off eastern Sabah near the Indonesian border, and Pulau Perak to the west of Penang..  At the opening of Johor's 12th State Assembly in June 2008, Sultan Iskandar of Johor pledged to reclaim the island ""whatever it takes"".. If any incident occurred in and around the waters of Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge, either side would provide humanitarian assistance to the vessels involved. Finally, both Malaysian and Singaporean fishermen could continue traditional fishing activities in those waters.. A Sub-Committee on Maritime and Airspace Management and Fisheries had also been formed, and after a meeting on 20 August 2008 it decided that traditional fishing activities by both countries should continue in waters beyond  off Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge. According to Malaysia, the JTC reached an impasse in November 2013, as both parties had been unable to agree over the meaning of the 2008 judgement as it concerns the South Ledge and the waters surrounding Pedra Branca."

As it is a maritime feature visible only at low tide, it belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located. On 21 December 1979, the Director of National Mapping of Malaysia published a map entitled Territorial Waters and Continental Shelf Boundaries of Malaysia showing Pedra Branca to be within its territorial waters. Other significant acts included the following:  Singapore had investigated shipwrecks in the waters around the island between 1920 and 1979.Pedra Branca case, para. In addition, Singapore had on two occasions claimed the sea around Pedra Branca as its territorial waters. Subsequently, in 1967, the Singapore Government's Marine Department also stated in an official memorandum to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Singapore) that the waters within three miles of Pedra Branca might be considered Singapore territorial waters.Para. Additionally, Malaysia had not shown any exercise of sovereignty over the uninhabited reefs of Middle Rocks and South Ledge while Singapore had consistently exercised sovereign authority in the surrounding waters. Therefore, by investigating and reporting on shipwrecks and maritime hazards within Pedra Branca's territorial waters Singapore had acted in accordance with best practice and not à titre de souverain.

It further held, by 15 votes to one, that sovereignty over Middle Rocks belongs to Malaysia, and sovereignty over South Ledge belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located.Pedra Branca case, operative clause; . South Ledge falls within the apparently overlapping territorial waters generated by the mainland of Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. Although in the Special Agreement and in their final submissions Malaysia and Singapore had asked the Court to decide which state had sovereignty over Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge, the Court had not been mandated to delimit the extent of the territorial waters of the two states in the area in question. Therefore, it simply held that South Ledge, as a low-tide elevation, belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located.Pedra Branca case, paras. Malaysia On the day the ICJ released its judgment, Rais Yatim asserted that since South Ledge was within the territorial waters of Middle Rocks, ""Malaysia appears to be the sovereign holder"".. A week later, the Foreign Ministry of Malaysia asked the Malaysian media to cease using the Malay word Pulau (""Island"") for Pedra Branca and to refer to it as ""Batu Puteh"" or ""Pedra Branca"".. Nonetheless, Malaysian agencies have taken up efforts to stake claims over a hundred islands, reefs, rocks and other features in the South China Sea, Malacca Straits, and off Sabahan waters that Malaysia could lose to China, Indonesia and Vietnam.. Two of these islands are Pulau Unarang off eastern Sabah near the Indonesian border, and Pulau Perak to the west of Penang..  At the opening of Johor's 12th State Assembly in June 2008, Sultan Iskandar of Johor pledged to reclaim the island ""whatever it takes"".. If any incident occurred in and around the waters of Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge, either side would provide humanitarian assistance to the vessels involved. Finally, both Malaysian and Singaporean fishermen could continue traditional fishing activities in those waters.. A Sub-Committee on Maritime and Airspace Management and Fisheries had also been formed, and after a meeting on 20 August 2008 it decided that traditional fishing activities by both countries should continue in waters beyond  off Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge. According to Malaysia, the JTC reached an impasse in November 2013, as both parties had been unable to agree over the meaning of the 2008 judgement as it concerns the South Ledge and the waters surrounding Pedra Branca."

History  The lake and dam are located in the suburb of Cirendeu, Ciputat in South Tangerang. It was made from earth compacted into a wall  high and the reservoir held at least  of water. The original use of the dam had been to retain water for irrigation of rice paddies which were then replaced by urban development. People living near the dam had made complaints about leaks in the past and the dam actually breached in November 2008 but no damage was done. The dam was overtopped, eroding the dam surface and resulting in a breach  wide at around 2 am on 27 March local time (7 pm 26 March GMT). The dam operators apparently sounded a warning siren shortly before the dam failed. The flood submerged five power terminals cutting drinking water supplies to the nearby suburb of Lebak Bulus. Emergency repairs to the dam structure were carried out and the government began inspections of similar dam structures."
ID-2003-4#-14721509,1.0,"Sovereignty over South Ledge belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located. The actions of the United Kingdom and Singapore in respect of the Horsburgh Lighthouse and the waters surrounding the island were not actions of the island's sovereign. As regards South Ledge, the Court noted that it falls within the apparently overlapping territorial waters generated by mainland Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. As it is a maritime feature visible only at low tide, it belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located. On 21 December 1979, the Director of National Mapping of Malaysia published a map entitled Territorial Waters and Continental Shelf Boundaries of Malaysia showing Pedra Branca to be within its territorial waters. Other significant acts included the following:  Singapore had investigated shipwrecks in the waters around the island between 1920 and 1979.Pedra Branca case, para. In addition, Singapore had on two occasions claimed the sea around Pedra Branca as its territorial waters. Subsequently, in 1967, the Singapore Government's Marine Department also stated in an official memorandum to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Singapore) that the waters within three miles of Pedra Branca might be considered Singapore territorial waters.Para. Additionally, Malaysia had not shown any exercise of sovereignty over the uninhabited reefs of Middle Rocks and South Ledge while Singapore had consistently exercised sovereign authority in the surrounding waters. Therefore, by investigating and reporting on shipwrecks and maritime hazards within Pedra Branca's territorial waters Singapore had acted in accordance with best practice and not à titre de souverain. Also, an internal confidential document dated 16 July 1968 entitled ""Letter of Promulgation"" by the Chief of the Royal Malaysian Navy included charts showing that Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge were within Malaysia's territorial waters,Pedra Branca case, para. 242. and the features were included within Malaysian fisheries waters in the Fisheries Act 1985. It further held, by 15 votes to one, that sovereignty over Middle Rocks belongs to Malaysia, and sovereignty over South Ledge belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located.Pedra Branca case, operative clause; . South Ledge falls within the apparently overlapping territorial waters generated by the mainland of Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. Although in the Special Agreement and in their final submissions Malaysia and Singapore had asked the Court to decide which state had sovereignty over Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge, the Court had not been mandated to delimit the extent of the territorial waters of the two states in the area in question. Therefore, it simply held that South Ledge, as a low-tide elevation, belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located.Pedra Branca case, paras. Malaysia On the day the ICJ released its judgment, Rais Yatim asserted that since South Ledge was within the territorial waters of Middle Rocks, ""Malaysia appears to be the sovereign holder"".. A week later, the Foreign Ministry of Malaysia asked the Malaysian media to cease using the Malay word Pulau (""Island"") for Pedra Branca and to refer to it as ""Batu Puteh"" or ""Pedra Branca"".. Nonetheless, Malaysian agencies have taken up efforts to stake claims over a hundred islands, reefs, rocks and other features in the South China Sea, Malacca Straits, and off Sabahan waters that Malaysia could lose to China, Indonesia and Vietnam.. Two of these islands are Pulau Unarang off eastern Sabah near the Indonesian border, and Pulau Perak to the west of Penang..  At the opening of Johor's 12th State Assembly in June 2008, Sultan Iskandar of Johor pledged to reclaim the island ""whatever it takes"".. If any incident occurred in and around the waters of Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge, either side would provide humanitarian assistance to the vessels involved. Finally, both Malaysian and Singaporean fishermen could continue traditional fishing activities in those waters.. A Sub-Committee on Maritime and Airspace Management and Fisheries had also been formed, and after a meeting on 20 August 2008 it decided that traditional fishing activities by both countries should continue in waters beyond  off Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge. According to Malaysia, the JTC reached an impasse in November 2013, as both parties had been unable to agree over the meaning of the 2008 judgement as it concerns the South Ledge and the waters surrounding Pedra Branca."

The dam was overtopped, eroding the dam surface and resulting in a breach  wide at around 2 am on 27 March local time (7 pm 26 March GMT). The dam operators apparently sounded a warning siren shortly before the dam failed. The flood submerged five power terminals cutting drinking water supplies to the nearby suburb of Lebak Bulus. Emergency repairs to the dam structure were carried out and the government began inspections of similar dam structures."
ID-2003-4#-14721509,1.0,"Sovereignty over South Ledge belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located. The actions of the United Kingdom and Singapore in respect of the Horsburgh Lighthouse and the waters surrounding the island were not actions of the island's sovereign. As regards South Ledge, the Court noted that it falls within the apparently overlapping territorial waters generated by mainland Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. As it is a maritime feature visible only at low tide, it belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located. On 21 December 1979, the Director of National Mapping of Malaysia published a map entitled Territorial Waters and Continental Shelf Boundaries of Malaysia showing Pedra Branca to be within its territorial waters. Other significant acts included the following:  Singapore had investigated shipwrecks in the waters around the island between 1920 and 1979.Pedra Branca case, para. In addition, Singapore had on two occasions claimed the sea around Pedra Branca as its territorial waters. Subsequently, in 1967, the Singapore Government's Marine Department also stated in an official memorandum to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Singapore) that the waters within three miles of Pedra Branca might be considered Singapore territorial waters.Para. Additionally, Malaysia had not shown any exercise of sovereignty over the uninhabited reefs of Middle Rocks and South Ledge while Singapore had consistently exercised sovereign authority in the surrounding waters. Therefore, by investigating and reporting on shipwrecks and maritime hazards within Pedra Branca's territorial waters Singapore had acted in accordance with best practice and not à titre de souverain. Also, an internal confidential document dated 16 July 1968 entitled ""Letter of Promulgation"" by the Chief of the Royal Malaysian Navy included charts showing that Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge were within Malaysia's territorial waters,Pedra Branca case, para. 242. and the features were included within Malaysian fisheries waters in the Fisheries Act 1985. It further held, by 15 votes to one, that sovereignty over Middle Rocks belongs to Malaysia, and sovereignty over South Ledge belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located.Pedra Branca case, operative clause; . South Ledge falls within the apparently overlapping territorial waters generated by the mainland of Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. Although in the Special Agreement and in their final submissions Malaysia and Singapore had asked the Court to decide which state had sovereignty over Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge, the Court had not been mandated to delimit the extent of the territorial waters of the two states in the area in question. Therefore, it simply held that South Ledge, as a low-tide elevation, belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located.Pedra Branca case, paras. Malaysia On the day the ICJ released its judgment, Rais Yatim asserted that since South Ledge was within the territorial waters of Middle Rocks, ""Malaysia appears to be the sovereign holder"".. A week later, the Foreign Ministry of Malaysia asked the Malaysian media to cease using the Malay word Pulau (""Island"") for Pedra Branca and to refer to it as ""Batu Puteh"" or ""Pedra Branca"".. Nonetheless, Malaysian agencies have taken up efforts to stake claims over a hundred islands, reefs, rocks and other features in the South China Sea, Malacca Straits, and off Sabahan waters that Malaysia could lose to China, Indonesia and Vietnam.. Two of these islands are Pulau Unarang off eastern Sabah near the Indonesian border, and Pulau Perak to the west of Penang..  At the opening of Johor's 12th State Assembly in June 2008, Sultan Iskandar of Johor pledged to reclaim the island ""whatever it takes"".. If any incident occurred in and around the waters of Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge, either side would provide humanitarian assistance to the vessels involved. Finally, both Malaysian and Singaporean fishermen could continue traditional fishing activities in those waters.. A Sub-Committee on Maritime and Airspace Management and Fisheries had also been formed, and after a meeting on 20 August 2008 it decided that traditional fishing activities by both countries should continue in waters beyond  off Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge. According to Malaysia, the JTC reached an impasse in November 2013, as both parties had been unable to agree over the meaning of the 2008 judgement as it concerns the South Ledge and the waters surrounding Pedra Branca."

The Airlele river was said to originate from Buquet China (present-day Bukit Cina). A fortress was designed and constructed encompassing a hill, lining the edge of the sea shore, on the south east of the river mouth, on the former site of the Sultan's palace. The pentagonal system began at the farthest point of the cape near south east of the river mouth, towards the west of the Fortaleza. The one running northward toward the river mouth was 130 fathoms in length to the bastion of São Pedro while the other one ran for 75 fathoms to the east, curving inshore, ending at the gate and bastion of Santiago. The suburb was rectangular in shape, with a northern walled boundary, the straits of Malacca to the south and the river of Malacca (Rio de Malaca) and the fortaleza's wall to the east. A stone bridge with sentry crosses the river Malacca to provide access to the Malacca Fortress via the eastern Custome House Terrace.

A system of tubes and valves made it possible to regulate the amount of water that remained in each compartment. By leaving more water in the compartments that were not 'under' the ship, less strain was put on the dock.

ID-2003-4#-35781553,1.0,"Context  Surabaya is on Madura Strait at the mouth of the Kali Mas river. The good connections to the interior that the river provided made Surabaya a good location for a harbor. In the 1840s this led to the construction of the navy base called 'Maritime Establishment' (Dutch: Maritiem Etablissement) just east of the river. The modern commercial harbor known as Port of Tanjung Perak (Dutch: Tandjong Perak) was constructed west of the river in the 1910s. At the time, the Noordhollandsch Kanaal was the only deep water connection from Amsterdam to the sea. In Le Havre such an economic limit to the length of the dock did not exist, and so the Havre Dock was much longer at 64 m. For Surabaya, this size limit was also not applicable, and like the dry dock in Le Havre, it would operate in salt water. She struck the reef with such force that within a few hours there was 5 feet of water inside the ship. That is, some water was let into the pit, and when the bottom was afloat, all support was removed. The water was then pumped out, and the coppered bottom of the drydock rested on the floor of the dockpit. The main difference is that wooden drydocks were basically rafts that were lowered by pumping water in and out of the superstructure on the sides. This is how the water 'chests' were formed. It was noted that even with the heaviest ships, the water on the outside was never so high. in the water compartments. Next, the communication between the outside water and the compartments was closed off, and the communication between the compartments and the pumps opened. The pumps then emptied the compartments, making that the dock rose, and most water inside the dock flowed off via the door. This continued till the lower, watertight part, of the door started to get above water. Next the communication between the compartments and the inside of the dock was opened, so the pumps could pump out the remaining water. The height of the water above the raft, that the door had to keep out was not that much. For contemporary frigates Oordt thought that the water would stay 80–90 cm above the raft of a suitable wooden dry dock. Dimensions  Surabaya dock had a length of 64 m, a beam of 20 m, was 7.5 m high and had a draft of 1.20 m. The draft of 1.20 m was an 'empty' draft, the dock would get lower by letting water into the sides. The dimensions of Surabaya dock did differ slightly from that of Le Havre, as it was 50 cm wider and higher, but was 10 cm higher in the water when empty. The guns, excess anchors and chains, iron water boxes, the upper rigging and all other heavy stores were removed. In 1879 Surabaya Wooden Dock received new boilers, even though she continuously made a lot of water.

The Airlele river was said to originate from Buquet China (present-day Bukit Cina). A fortress was designed and constructed encompassing a hill, lining the edge of the sea shore, on the south east of the river mouth, on the former site of the Sultan's palace. The pentagonal system began at the farthest point of the cape near south east of the river mouth, towards the west of the Fortaleza. The one running northward toward the river mouth was 130 fathoms in length to the bastion of São Pedro while the other one ran for 75 fathoms to the east, curving inshore, ending at the gate and bastion of Santiago. The suburb was rectangular in shape, with a northern walled boundary, the straits of Malacca to the south and the river of Malacca (Rio de Malaca) and the fortaleza's wall to the east. A stone bridge with sentry crosses the river Malacca to provide access to the Malacca Fortress via the eastern Custome House Terrace.
