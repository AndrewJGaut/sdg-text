a wheeling arrangement with Eskom', '  Effectively, Eskom supplied southern Mozambique (Maputo) from the then Eastern Transvaal at 132\xa0kV with the sales deducted from the HCB supply to Eskom', '  The tripartite agreement was suspended due to force majeure when the line from Cahora Bassa was unavailable in the 1980s', '  The system was commissioned in three stages starting in March 1977 with four six-pulse bridges, and in full operation of eight bridges on March 15, 1979', '   Transmission line  The power line runs from the Songo converter station, which is near the hydroelectric station and normally operates as a rectifier, to the Apollo converter station near Johannesburg, which normally operates as an inverter', '  Each of the self-supporting steel towers along the route carries two bundles of four 565\xa0square millimetre (1120\xa0kcmil) cables, one per pole, and a single 117\xa0square millimetre (231\xa0kcmil) grounding conductor', '  There are approximately 7,000\xa0towers

the thyristor valves are outdoor mounted', ' In the original installation they were oil filled for both cooling and electrical insulation', '  The only other HVDC scheme in the world equipped in this way from the outset was the first phase – now decommissioned – of the Shin Shinano frequency converter in Japan', '  Each valve tank contains two valves, forming a double-valve connecting the two DC terminals to one single-phase, two-winding converter transformer', '  Each six-pulse bridge contains three such tanks and hence each station contains 24 double-valves', '  The development work for the thyristor valves began in the late 1960s when the only thyristors available at the time were, by today’s standards, small, and were rated only 1', '6\xa0kV each', '  In the first phase of the project (4 bridges at each end) each valve contained 280 such thyristors in series with two in parallel – the largest number ever used in a single HVDC valve', '  Phases 2 and 3 used improved thyristors with a rating of 2', '4\xa0kV each and only required 192 in series per valve – still a large number by modern standards – with two in parallel', '  As a result, each converter station contained a total of 22,656\xa0thyristors', '   Other equipment  The thyristors also had poor transient overcurrent capability, so another unusual feature of the scheme was the existence of overcurrent diverters between the valves and transformers, although these were later decommissioned at the Apollo station', '  AC filters tuned to the 5th, 7th, 11th and 13th harmonics of the 50\xa0Hz power supply are installed at each station, approximately 195\xa0MVAr at Apollo and 210\xa0MVAr at Songo', '  There are two PLC repeater stations: one at Gamaboi in South Africa and one at Catope in Mozambique', '  Repairing the war damage After the civil war ended in 1992, one of the many effects of the decade of strife was the damage to the HVDC transmission lines', ' Nearly all of the 4200\xa0transmission line towers located on the  of line in Mozambique needed to be replaced or refurbished', ' This work was started in 1995 and took until late 1997 to complete', ' The system was restored to full power transmission capacity by 1998', '  Subsequently, Eskom has commenced electricity supply to Mozambique at 400\xa0kV, under terms similar to the original wheeling agreement, from the Arnot Power Station in Mpumalanga, via Swaziland', ' The principal purpose of this infrastructure is to provide bulk electricity supplies to the Mozal Aluminium Smelter operated by BHP', '  The Memorandum of Understanding, signed on 2 November 2007, means that Mozambique will by the end of 2007 be in charge of a project located on its soil but on which it had no control for the past 30 years due to contractual obligations with Portugal', '  The new arrangement gives Mozambique 85 percent of the Cahora Bassa Hydroelectric (HCB) project while Portugal will retain only 15 percent', ' The project has a capacity to produce 2,000 megawatts of electricity and is one of the main suppliers of power to the Southern African Power Pool', '  Mozambique will, however, need to pay US$950 million to the Portuguese government as compensation for the post civil-war reconstruction and maintenance of the dam', '  The civil war resulted in serious damage to the transmission infrastructure, forcing the Portuguese government to pay about US$2', '5 billion out of pocket to repair it', '   Apollo station upgrade  thumb|The Apollo HVDC converter station and distribution lines', ' The Cahora Bassa HVDC line can be seen as the tall pylons on the left', ' The line in the centre of the picture with a single conductor is the electrode line of HVDC Cahora Bassa In 2006 a contract was awarded to ABB to replace the thyristor valves at the Apollo station', '  The outdoor mounting concept was retained, but each of the new housings contains a complete six-pulse bridge instead of only two valves, and the replacement thyristor valves are of a more conventional air insulated, water-cooled design using 125mm, 8', '5\xa0kV thyristors', '  36 such thyristors are connected in series in each valve, without parallel

subsequently became part of ABB and AEG subsequently became part of Alstom', '  The commercial arrangements also included Electricidade de Moçambique (EDM) which took supply from Cahora Bassa through a wheeling arrangement with Eskom', '  Effectively, Eskom supplied southern Mozambique (Maputo) from the then Eastern Transvaal at 132\xa0kV with the sales deducted from the HCB supply to Eskom', '  The tripartite agreement was suspended due to force majeure when the line from Cahora Bassa was unavailable in the 1980s', '  The system was commissioned in three stages starting in March 1977 with

the thyristor valves are outdoor mounted', ' In the original installation they were oil filled for both cooling and electrical insulation', '  The only other HVDC scheme in the world equipped in this way from the outset was the first phase – now decommissioned – of the Shin Shinano frequency converter in Japan', '  Each valve tank contains two valves, forming a double-valve connecting the two DC terminals to one single-phase, two-winding converter transformer', '  Each six-pulse bridge contains three such tanks and hence each station contains 24 double-valves', '  The development work for the thyristor valves began in the late 1960s when the only thyristors available at the time were, by today’s standards, small, and were rated only 1', '6\xa0kV each', '  In the first phase of the project

a rating of 2', '4\xa0kV each and only required 192 in series per valve – still a large number by modern standards – with two in parallel', '  As a result, each converter station contained a total of 22,656\xa0thyristors', '   Other equipment  The thyristors also had poor transient overcurrent capability, so another unusual feature of the scheme was the existence of overcurrent diverters between the valves and transformers, although these were later decommissioned at the Apollo station', '  AC filters tuned to the 5th, 7th, 11th and 13th harmonics of the 50\xa0Hz power supply are installed at

of Portugal and 85% by Mozambique', '  Equipment was constructed and supplied by ZAMCO, which was a consortium of AEG-Telefunken JV, Brown Boveri Company, and Siemens AG of Germany', '  Brown Boveri subsequently became part of ABB and AEG subsequently became part of Alstom', '  The commercial arrangements also included Electricidade de Moçambique (EDM) which took supply from Cahora Bassa through a wheeling arrangement with Eskom', '  Effectively, Eskom supplied southern Mozambique (Maputo) from the then Eastern Transvaal at 132\xa0kV with the sales deducted from the HCB supply to Eskom', '  The tripartite agreement was suspended due to force majeure when the line from Cahora Bassa was unavailable in the 1980s', '  The system was commissioned in three stages starting in March 1977 with four six-pulse bridges, and in full operation of eight bridges on March 15, 1979', '   Transmission line  The power line runs from the Songo converter station, which is near the hydroelectric station and normally operates as a rectifier, to the Apollo converter station near Johannesburg, which normally operates as an inverter', '  Each of the self-supporting steel towers along the route carries two bundles of four 565\xa0square millimetre (1120\xa0kcmil) cables, one per pole, and a single 117\xa0square millimetre (231\xa0kcmil) grounding conductor', '  There are approximately 7,000\xa0towers

smoothing reactors and surge arrester capacitors at each station', '   Thyristor valves  Cahora Bassa was one of the first HVDC schemes built with thyristor valves from its inception', ' Unusually, the thyristor valves are outdoor mounted', ' In the original installation they were oil filled for both cooling and electrical insulation', '  The only other HVDC scheme in the world equipped in this way from the outset was the first phase – now decommissioned – of the Shin Shinano frequency converter in Japan', '  Each valve tank contains two valves, forming a double-valve connecting the two DC terminals to one single-phase, two-winding converter transformer', '  Each six-pulse bridge contains three such tanks and hence each station contains 24 double-valves', '  The development work for the thyristor valves began in the late 1960s when the only thyristors available at the time were, by today’s standards, small, and were rated only 1', '6\xa0kV each', '  In the first phase of the project (4 bridges at each end) each valve contained 280 such thyristors in series with two in parallel – the largest number ever used in a single HVDC valve', '  Phases 2 and 3 used improved thyristors with a rating of 2', '4\xa0kV each and only required 192 in series per valve – still a large number by modern standards – with two in parallel', '  As a result, each converter station contained a total of 22,656\xa0thyristors', '   Other equipment  The thyristors also had poor transient overcurrent capability, so another unusual feature of the scheme was the existence of overcurrent diverters between the valves and transformers, although these were later decommissioned at the Apollo station', '  AC filters tuned to the 5th, 7th, 11th and 13th harmonics of the 50\xa0Hz power supply are installed at

capacity by 1998', '  Subsequently, Eskom has commenced electricity supply to Mozambique at 400\xa0kV, under terms similar to the original wheeling agreement, from the Arnot Power Station in

to produce 2,000 megawatts of electricity and is one of the main suppliers of power to the Southern African Power Pool', '  Mozambique will, however, need to pay US$950 million to the Portuguese

subsequently became part of ABB and AEG subsequently became part of Alstom', '  The commercial arrangements also included Electricidade de Moçambique (EDM) which took supply from Cahora Bassa through a wheeling arrangement with Eskom', '  Effectively, Eskom supplied southern Mozambique (Maputo) from the then Eastern Transvaal at 132\xa0kV with the sales deducted from the HCB supply to Eskom', '  The tripartite agreement was suspended due to force majeure when the line from Cahora Bassa was unavailable in the 1980s', '  The system was commissioned in three stages starting in March 1977 with

the thyristor valves are outdoor mounted', ' In the original installation they were oil filled for both cooling and electrical insulation', '  The only other HVDC scheme in the world equipped in this way from the outset was the first phase – now decommissioned – of the Shin Shinano frequency converter in Japan', '  Each valve tank contains two valves, forming a double-valve connecting the two DC terminals to one single-phase, two-winding converter transformer', '  Each six-pulse bridge contains three such tanks and hence each station contains 24 double-valves', '  The development work for the thyristor valves began in the late 1960s when the only thyristors available at the time were, by today’s standards, small, and were rated only 1', '6\xa0kV each', '  In the first phase of the project

a rating of 2', '4\xa0kV each and only required 192 in series per valve – still a large number by modern standards – with two in parallel', '  As a result, each converter station contained a total of 22,656\xa0thyristors', '   Other equipment  The thyristors also had poor transient overcurrent capability, so another unusual feature of the scheme was the existence of overcurrent diverters between the valves and transformers, although these were later decommissioned at the Apollo station', '  AC filters tuned to the 5th, 7th, 11th and 13th harmonics of the 50\xa0Hz power supply are installed at

subsequently became part of ABB and AEG subsequently became part of Alstom', '  The commercial arrangements also included Electricidade de Moçambique (EDM) which took supply from Cahora Bassa through

The tripartite agreement was suspended due to force majeure when the line from Cahora Bassa was unavailable in the 1980s', '  The system was commissioned in three stages starting in March 1977 with

the thyristor valves are outdoor mounted', ' In the original installation they were oil filled for both cooling and electrical insulation', '  The only other HVDC scheme in the world equipped in this way from the outset was the first phase – now decommissioned – of the Shin Shinano frequency converter in Japan', '  Each valve tank contains two valves, forming a double-valve connecting the two DC terminals to one single-phase, two-winding converter transformer', '  Each six-pulse bridge contains three such tanks and hence each station contains 24 double-valves', '  The development work for the thyristor valves began in the late 1960s when the only thyristors available at the time were, by today’s standards, small, and were rated only 1', '6\xa0kV each', '  In the first phase of the project

a rating of 2', '4\xa0kV each and only required 192 in series per valve – still a large number by modern standards – with two in parallel', '  As a result, each converter station contained a total of 22,656\xa0thyristors', '   Other equipment  The thyristors also had poor transient overcurrent capability, so another unusual feature of the scheme was the existence of overcurrent diverters between the valves and transformers, although these were later decommissioned at the Apollo station', '  AC filters tuned to the 5th, 7th, 11th and 13th harmonics of the 50\xa0Hz power supply are installed at
