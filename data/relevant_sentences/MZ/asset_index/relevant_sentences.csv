converter station and part of the transmission system required to bring the electricity from the South African/Mozambican border to the Apollo converter station near Pretoria', ' South Africa was then obliged to buy electricity that Portugal was obliged to supply', '  During the struggle for independence, construction materials for the dam were repeatedly attacked in a strategic move by Frelimo

Before the arrival of Vasco de Gama in 1498, and according to local oral tradition, the Archipelago of Angoche, made up of several islands, was inhabited by a community that was part of the Swahili, on the East African coast', ' The dominant groups in the region, the Anhapakhos, were members of the Shiraz family, which allegedly reached the islands of Angoche and Quiloa Island (in present-day Tanzania) whose sultans were also Shirazis, originating from the port of Shiraz, located on the Persian coast of the Sea Red', ' One of the founders of the reigning family of the Sultanate of Angoche was Hasani, who died at sea and was buried on the island that was later named after him, Kisiwa Sultani Hasani (known as Ilha de Mafamede by the Portuguese)', ' According to Duarte Barbosa, who wrote in 1508, the habits, customs and language of the inhabitants of the islands of Angoche were similar to those of the Ilha de Moçambique', '  At the time of the arrival of the first islamic explorers, whom the Portuguese called “Moors”, the Marundos peoples, descendants of the Amacúas, already inhabited the lands of Angoche', ' According to oral accounts, this people had already been constituted before the first Bantu incursion', ' The story goes that two important men with the names Mussa and Hassan, accompanied by their relatives and slaves, left Zanzibar following religious differences and headed for and settled in Ilha de Moçambique', ' One day, Hassan, intending to reach the mainland of Mozambique, in the Angoche Bay region, was surprised by a strong storm, ending up losing his life when he fell into the sea', ' Hassan was buried in the nearest place which was the Mafamede island', "" Notifying Mussa of Hassan's death, he went to the site to see Hassan's tomb, having boarded the village of Mialule, now Melule"", "" Arrived at Mafamede where Hassan had been buried and, having Mussa liked the place, there he left his son Xosa who chose Muchelele, a place close to Hassan's tomb, to establish his residence and where he started to govern with the title of Sultan"", "" They are some of Xosa's children who give rise to the population of Catamoio which, in turn, gives rise to the Village of Angoche"", '   Portuguese Colonial and Occupation Resistance  In 1863, the land was conquered from the Portuguese by Sultan Mussa, supported by slave traders', ' Until the mid-19th century, the Portuguese were unable to control or settle on the islands or mainland of Angoche', ' The situation changed when one of the members of the royal family of the Angoche Islands, Mussa Mohammad Sahib Quanto (d', ' 1879), decided to attack the deadlines of Macanja da Costa, belonging to the Silva brothers, because of the dispute over the control of the roads of flow of slaves from the interior to the coast', '   The Portuguese went to support the da Silvas and a small military detachment of about twenty elements came to occupy the island in 1861, together with João Bonifácio da Silva, one of the Silva brothers', ' The pleasure people, after taking revenge on the Anhapakhos, had no interest in settling on the islands and returned to their land', ' Consequently, Mussa  Quanto  recovered the island, where he was installed as sultan and the few Portuguese present were expelled', ' From the beginning of the ""effective occupation"" of Africa, which had a decisive start in 1895, the islands of Angoche suffered repeated assaults by the Portuguese', ' Then the other member of the Angoche royal family, Omar bin Nacogo Farallahi (known as Farelay by the Portuguese), along with Sultan Ibrahim and his allies, the mainland Macuas, led the resistance that lasted until 1910, when Massano de Amorim and other Portuguese officers managed to conquer the region militarily', '   After taking the island in 1861, the Portuguese created the modern settlement (decree dated 05', '07', '1865), whose charter was approved in the mid-twentieth century (Ordinance No', ' 11', '585 of 04', '08', '1956, when the town was supplied with water)', ' The evolution of the administrative process of Angoche then went through the following stages throughout the 19th century: seat of circumscription on July 30, 1921, and county seat on October 31, 1934; it elevated the village on December 19, 1934 and the city on September 26, 1970', ' Although the Portuguese continued to administer the region from one of the islands of Angoche (Quiloa), there was already a small Portuguese population in Parapato, in part mainland', '   From the beginning of the 1930s, at the time of the Estado Novo, the mainland Angoche region became one of the centers of cashew and rice production, in addition to traditional fishing, which already existed on the coast', ' The Portuguese identified the Puli area, where the Africans lived, as the best continental part of Parapato', ' Consequently, the Africans were resettled in the Bairro de Inguri, created at this time, and in Puli the European masonry village called António Enes was built', ' The urban evolution can be followed through the municipal edition Planta da Vila de António Enes (esc', ' 1/5,000), dated 1958, in which the elementary grid that makes up the town on the coast is drawn', ' The 20th century urbanization plans or studies date from 1924, 1932 and 1965 (the latter being authored by the architect Bernardino Ramalhete and revised by Hidrotécnica Portuguesa in 1972)', ' In 1968 and 1972, the colonial government, concerned about the spread of liberation movements in northern Mozambique, carried out several measures aimed at winning Muslims to its side, although many of them were also related to the policies of decentralization of the Portuguese government from 1971, which allowed the channeling of new funds to the colonies', ' This resulted in an improvement in the quality of life of the African population, including basic sanitation and the construction of masonry neighborhoods for Africans, including the Bairro de Inguri, in the city of Angoche', ' At the same time, the Portuguese government restored some important historic mosques and built new ones, such as the Mosque of Catamoio, on one of the islands of Angoche, inaugurated by General Kaúlza de Arriaga in 1971', ' Monuments and Statues The Monument to António is highlighted Enes, simple bust on a pedestal, in front of the City Hall (built before 1954)', ' It was built as a ""homage to the population of the county"", as one could read in the inscription on its base, which consists of a prismatic stone volume with two buttresses, also in stone, on each side', '  Angoche was one of the most important socio-economic centers in the region', ' With the proclamation of National Independence, in February 1976, the city of António Enes was renamed Angoche', ' In 1997 the city is elevated to the category of City Municipality, under Law 10/97 of 31 May', '   Geography    Neighboring Districts  Angoche District is limited by:   Mogincual District

Before the arrival of Vasco de Gama in 1498, and according to local oral tradition, the Archipelago of Angoche, made up of several islands, was inhabited by a community that was part of the Swahili, on the East African coast', ' The dominant groups in the region, the Anhapakhos, were members of the Shiraz family, which allegedly reached the islands of Angoche and Quiloa Island (in present-day Tanzania) whose sultans were also Shirazis, originating from the port of Shiraz, located on the Persian coast of the Sea Red', ' One of the founders of the reigning family of the Sultanate of Angoche was Hasani, who died at sea and was buried on the island that was later named after him, Kisiwa Sultani Hasani (known as Ilha de Mafamede by the Portuguese)', ' According to Duarte Barbosa, who wrote in 1508, the habits, customs and language of the inhabitants of the islands of Angoche were similar to those of the Ilha de Moçambique', '  At the time of the arrival of the first islamic explorers, whom the Portuguese called “Moors”, the Marundos peoples, descendants of the Amacúas, already inhabited the lands of Angoche', ' According to oral accounts, this people had already been constituted before the first Bantu incursion', ' The story goes that two important men with the names Mussa and Hassan, accompanied by their relatives and slaves, left Zanzibar following religious differences and headed for and settled in Ilha de Moçambique', ' One day, Hassan, intending to reach the mainland of Mozambique, in the Angoche Bay region, was surprised by a strong storm, ending up losing his life when he fell into the sea', ' Hassan was buried in the nearest place which was the Mafamede island', "" Notifying Mussa of Hassan's death, he went to the site to see Hassan's tomb, having boarded the village of Mialule, now Melule"", "" Arrived at Mafamede where Hassan had been buried and, having Mussa liked the place, there he left his son Xosa who chose Muchelele, a place close to Hassan's tomb, to establish his residence and where he started to govern with the title of Sultan"", "" They are some of Xosa's children who give rise to the population of Catamoio which, in turn, gives rise to the Village of Angoche"", '   Portuguese Colonial and Occupation Resistance  In 1863, the land was conquered from the Portuguese by Sultan Mussa, supported by slave traders', ' Until the mid-19th century, the Portuguese were unable to control or settle on the islands or mainland of Angoche', ' The situation changed when one of the members of the royal family of the Angoche Islands, Mussa Mohammad Sahib Quanto (d', ' 1879), decided to attack the deadlines of Macanja da Costa, belonging to the Silva brothers, because of the dispute over the control of the roads of flow of slaves from the interior to the coast', '   The Portuguese went to support the da Silvas and a small military detachment of about twenty elements came to occupy the island in 1861, together with João Bonifácio da Silva, one of the Silva brothers', ' The pleasure people, after taking revenge on the Anhapakhos, had no interest in settling on the islands and returned to their land', ' Consequently, Mussa  Quanto  recovered the island, where he was installed as sultan and the few Portuguese present were expelled', ' From the beginning of the ""effective occupation"" of Africa, which had a decisive start in 1895, the islands of Angoche suffered repeated assaults by the Portuguese', ' Then the other member of the Angoche royal family, Omar bin Nacogo Farallahi (known as Farelay by the Portuguese), along with Sultan Ibrahim and his allies, the mainland Macuas, led the resistance that lasted until 1910, when Massano de Amorim and other Portuguese officers managed to conquer the region militarily', '   After taking the island in 1861, the Portuguese created the modern settlement (decree dated 05', '07', '1865), whose charter was approved in the mid-twentieth century (Ordinance No', ' 11', '585 of 04', '08', '1956, when the town was supplied with water)', ' The evolution of the administrative process of Angoche then went through the following stages throughout the 19th century: seat of circumscription on July 30, 1921, and county seat on October 31, 1934; it elevated the village on December 19, 1934 and the city on September 26, 1970', ' Although the Portuguese continued to administer the region from one of the islands of Angoche (Quiloa), there was already a small Portuguese population in Parapato, in part mainland', '   From the beginning of the 1930s, at the time of the Estado Novo, the mainland Angoche region became one of the centers of cashew and rice production, in addition to traditional fishing, which already existed on the coast', ' The Portuguese identified the Puli area, where the Africans lived, as the best continental part of Parapato', ' Consequently, the Africans were resettled in the Bairro de Inguri, created at this time, and in Puli the European masonry village called António Enes was built', ' The urban evolution can be followed through the municipal edition Planta da Vila de António Enes (esc', ' 1/5,000), dated 1958, in which the elementary grid that makes up the town on the coast is drawn', ' The 20th century urbanization plans or studies date from 1924, 1932 and 1965 (the latter being authored by the architect Bernardino Ramalhete and revised by Hidrotécnica Portuguesa in 1972)', ' In 1968 and 1972, the colonial government, concerned about the spread of liberation movements in northern Mozambique, carried out several measures aimed at winning Muslims to its side, although many of them were also related to the policies of decentralization of the Portuguese government from 1971, which allowed the channeling of new funds to the colonies', ' This resulted in an improvement in the quality of life of the African population, including basic sanitation and the construction of masonry neighborhoods for Africans, including the Bairro de Inguri, in the city of Angoche', ' At the same time, the Portuguese government restored some important historic mosques and built new ones, such as the Mosque of Catamoio, on one of the islands of Angoche, inaugurated by General Kaúlza de Arriaga in 1971', ' Monuments and Statues The Monument to António is highlighted Enes, simple bust on a pedestal, in front of the City Hall (built before 1954)', ' It was built as a ""homage to the population of the county"", as one could read in the inscription on its base, which consists of a prismatic stone volume with two buttresses, also in stone, on each side', '  Angoche was one of the most important socio-economic centers in the region', ' With the proclamation of National Independence, in February 1976, the city of António Enes was renamed Angoche', ' In 1997 the city is elevated to the category of City Municipality, under Law 10/97 of 31 May', '   Geography    Neighboring Districts  Angoche District is limited by:   Mogincual District

rebels reportedly associated with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) captured the city of Mocímboa da Praia during an offensive', "" The Islamic State's Central Africa Province (IS-CAP) declared Mocímboa da Praia its capital, and held it into 2021"", ' In response to the escalating rebellion, the Mozambican government hired several private military companies, most importantly the South African Dyck Advisory Group (DAG)', ' In addition, local authorities and companies operating in Cabo Delgado also employed security contractors', ' French energy giant Total SE which maintained a site at the Afungi peninsula near Palma, had hired at least five security companies, namely Arkhe, GardaWorld, Blue Mountain, Control Risks and G4S', ' Total SE maintained that its security contractors were generally unarmed', ' The Total SE site had been described as a project which could completely change the local economy, as it would provide a massive revenue to the Mozambican

were identified as belonging to IS-CAP', ' The relation between Ansar al-Sunna, known by a variety of names, and IS-CAP is generally unclear', ' Experts suspect that parts or all of Ansar al-Sunna have joined IS-CAP, but that ISIL central command exerts almost no control over its Mozambican affiliates', ' ISIL has taken responsibility for a relatively small number of attacks in Mozambique, compared to the overall insurgency, but has claimed its involvement in the most significant rebel operations', ' Following the battle, refugees stated that some of the rebel commanders were Tanzanians

at Palma were generally well-organized and wearing uniforms', ' Several rebel fighters were reportedly child soldiers which would mark the first time that children were used as fighters during the

showcased the battle was judged by experts to have been taken weeks before the operation', ' Jamestown Foundation analyst Jacob Zenn argued that this hinted at some kind of communications breakdown

had received too little opportunity or resources to upgrade their skills and improve their economic and social situation to a degree comparable to that of the Europeans.As part of their response to FRELIMO, the Portuguese government began to pay more attention to creating favourable conditions for social development and economic growth.' Rebounding growth The resettlement of civil war refugees and successful economic reform have led to a high growth rate: the country enjoyed a remarkable recovery, achieving an average annual rate of economic growth of 8% between 1996 and 2006 and between 6–7% from 2006 to 2011"

subsequently became part of ABB and AEG subsequently became part of Alstom', '  The commercial arrangements also included Electricidade de Moçambique (EDM) which took supply from Cahora Bassa through a wheeling arrangement with Eskom', '  Effectively, Eskom supplied southern Mozambique (Maputo) from the then Eastern Transvaal at 132\xa0kV with the sales deducted from the HCB supply to Eskom', '  The tripartite agreement was suspended due to force majeure when the line from Cahora Bassa was unavailable in the 1980s', '  The system was commissioned in three stages starting in March 1977 with four six-pulse bridges, and in full operation of eight bridges on March 15, 1979', '   Transmission line  The power line runs from the Songo converter station, which is near the hydroelectric station

the thyristor valves are outdoor mounted', ' In the original installation they were oil filled for both cooling and electrical insulation', '  The only other HVDC scheme in the world equipped in this way from the outset was the first phase – now decommissioned – of the Shin Shinano frequency converter in Japan', '  Each valve tank contains two valves, forming a double-valve connecting the two DC terminals to one single-phase, two-winding converter transformer', '  Each six-pulse bridge contains three such tanks and hence each station contains 24 double-valves', '  The development work for the thyristor valves began in the late 1960s when the only thyristors available at the time were, by today’s standards, small, and were rated only 1', '6\xa0kV each', '  In the first phase of the project (4 bridges at each end) each valve contained 280 such thyristors in series with two in parallel – the largest number ever used in a single HVDC valve', '  Phases 2 and 3 used improved thyristors with a rating of 2', '4\xa0kV each and only required 192 in series per valve – still a large number by modern standards – with two in parallel', '  As a result, each converter station contained a total of 22,656\xa0thyristors', '   Other equipment  The thyristors also had poor transient overcurrent capability, so another unusual feature of the scheme was the existence of overcurrent diverters between the valves and transformers, although these were later decommissioned at the Apollo station', '  AC filters tuned to the 5th, 7th, 11th and 13th harmonics of the 50\xa0Hz power supply are installed at

subsequently became part of ABB and AEG subsequently became part of Alstom', '  The commercial arrangements also included Electricidade de Moçambique (EDM) which took supply from Cahora Bassa through a wheeling arrangement with Eskom', '  Effectively, Eskom supplied southern Mozambique (Maputo) from the then Eastern Transvaal at 132\xa0kV with the sales deducted from the HCB supply to Eskom', '  The tripartite agreement was suspended due to force majeure when the line from Cahora Bassa was unavailable in the 1980s', '  The system was commissioned in three stages starting in March 1977 with

the thyristor valves are outdoor mounted', ' In the original installation they were oil filled for both cooling and electrical insulation', '  The only other HVDC scheme in the world equipped in this way from the outset was the first phase – now decommissioned – of the Shin Shinano frequency converter in Japan', '  Each valve tank contains two valves, forming a double-valve connecting the two DC terminals to one single-phase, two-winding converter transformer', '  Each six-pulse bridge contains three such tanks and hence each station contains 24 double-valves', '  The development work for the thyristor valves began in the late 1960s when the only thyristors available at the time were, by today’s standards, small, and were rated only 1', '6\xa0kV each', '  In the first phase of the project (4 bridges at each end) each valve contained 280 such thyristors in series with two in parallel – the largest number ever used in a single HVDC valve', '  Phases 2 and 3 used improved thyristors with a rating of 2', '4\xa0kV each and only required 192 in series per valve – still a large number by modern standards – with two in parallel', '  As a result, each converter station contained a total of 22,656\xa0thyristors', '   Other equipment  The thyristors also had poor transient overcurrent capability, so another unusual feature of the scheme was the existence of overcurrent diverters between the valves and transformers, although these were later decommissioned at the Apollo station', '  AC filters tuned to the 5th, 7th, 11th and 13th harmonics of the 50\xa0Hz power supply are installed at

utilities, Electricity Supply Commission (ESCOM, as it was known prior to 1987), latterly Eskom, Johannesburg, South Africa and Hidroelectrica de Cahora Bassa (HCB), a firm owned 15% by the government of Portugal and 85% by Mozambique', '  Equipment was constructed and supplied by ZAMCO, which was a consortium of AEG-Telefunken JV, Brown Boveri Company, and Siemens AG of Germany', '  Brown Boveri subsequently became part of ABB and AEG subsequently became part of Alstom', '  The commercial arrangements also included Electricidade de Moçambique (EDM) which took supply from Cahora Bassa through a wheeling arrangement with Eskom', '  Effectively, Eskom supplied southern Mozambique (Maputo) from the then Eastern Transvaal at 132\xa0kV with the sales deducted from the HCB supply to Eskom', '  The tripartite agreement was suspended due to force majeure when the line from Cahora Bassa was unavailable in the 1980s', '  The system was commissioned in three stages starting in March 1977 with four six-pulse bridges, and in full operation of eight bridges on March 15, 1979', '   Transmission line  The power line runs from the Songo converter station, which is near the hydroelectric station and normally operates as a rectifier, to the Apollo converter station near Johannesburg, which normally operates as an inverter', '  Each of the self-supporting steel towers along the route carries two bundles of four 565\xa0square millimetre (1120\xa0kcmil) cables, one per pole, and a single 117\xa0square millimetre (231\xa0kcmil) grounding conductor', '  There are approximately 7,000\xa0towers with an average span of ', '  The maximum span is  using reinforced towers', ' Earth return for unipolar operation is provided by buried graphite electrodes at each station', ' The DC line has smoothing reactors and surge arrester capacitors at each station', '   Thyristor valves  Cahora Bassa was one of the first HVDC schemes built with thyristor valves from its inception', ' Unusually, the thyristor valves are outdoor mounted', ' In the original installation they were oil filled for both cooling and electrical insulation', '  The only other HVDC scheme in the world equipped in this way from the outset was the first phase – now decommissioned – of the Shin Shinano frequency converter in Japan', '  Each valve tank contains two valves, forming a double-valve connecting the two DC terminals to one single-phase, two-winding converter transformer', '  Each six-pulse bridge contains three such tanks and hence each station contains 24 double-valves', '  The development work for the thyristor valves began in the late 1960s when the only thyristors available at the time were, by today’s standards, small, and were rated only 1', '6\xa0kV each', '  In the first phase of the project (4 bridges at each end) each valve contained 280 such thyristors in series with two in parallel – the largest number ever used in a single HVDC valve', '  Phases 2 and 3 used improved thyristors with a rating of 2', '4\xa0kV each and only required 192 in series per valve – still a large number by modern standards – with two in parallel', '  As a result, each converter station contained a total of 22,656\xa0thyristors', '   Other equipment  The thyristors also had poor transient overcurrent capability, so another unusual feature of the scheme was the existence of overcurrent diverters between the valves and transformers, although these were later decommissioned at the Apollo station', '  AC filters tuned to the 5th, 7th, 11th and 13th harmonics of the 50\xa0Hz power supply are installed at each station, approximately 195\xa0MVAr at Apollo and 210\xa0MVAr at Songo', '  There are two PLC repeater stations: one at Gamaboi in South Africa and one at Catope in Mozambique', '  Repairing the war damage After the civil war ended in 1992, one of the many effects of the decade of strife was the damage to the HVDC transmission lines', ' Nearly all of the 4200\xa0transmission line towers located on the  of line in Mozambique needed to be replaced or refurbished', ' This work was started in 1995 and took until late 1997 to complete', ' The system was restored to full power transmission capacity by 1998', '  Subsequently, Eskom has commenced electricity supply to Mozambique at 400\xa0kV, under terms similar to the original wheeling agreement, from the Arnot Power Station in Mpumalanga, via Swaziland', ' The principal purpose of this infrastructure is to provide bulk electricity supplies to the Mozal Aluminium Smelter operated by BHP', '  The Memorandum of Understanding, signed on 2 November 2007, means that Mozambique will by the end of 2007 be in charge of a project located on its soil but on which it had no control for the past 30 years due to contractual obligations with Portugal', '  The new arrangement gives Mozambique 85 percent of the Cahora Bassa Hydroelectric (HCB) project while Portugal will retain only 15 percent', ' The project has a capacity to produce 2,000 megawatts of electricity and is one of the main suppliers of power to the Southern African Power Pool', '  Mozambique will, however, need to pay US$950 million to the Portuguese government as compensation for the post civil-war reconstruction and maintenance of the dam', '  The civil war resulted in serious damage to the transmission infrastructure, forcing the Portuguese government to pay about US$2', '5 billion out of pocket to repair it', '   Apollo station upgrade  thumb|The Apollo HVDC converter station and distribution lines', ' The Cahora Bassa HVDC line can be

thyristor valves at the Apollo station', '  The outdoor mounting concept was retained, but each of the new housings contains a complete six-pulse bridge instead of only two valves, and the replacement thyristor valves are of a more conventional air insulated, water-cooled design using 125mm, 8', '5\xa0kV thyristors', '  36 such thyristors are connected in series in each valve, without parallel

personnel attacked bridges and a major staging point for Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) insurgents in Gaza Province', ' The battle eventually drew in elements of the Mozambican army and police, who sustained heavy casualties', ' Along with Operation Miracle, this was one of the largest Rhodesian external operations of the war', '  Targets During the Rhodesian Bush War (or Second Chimurenga) the Rhodesian Security Forces (RSF) had to deal with an increasing flow of externally trained insurgents coming into Rhodesia, latterly Zimbabwe Rhodesia, from its neighbouring countries, especially from Zambia and Mozambique, the latter in particular after its independence in 1975', '  The objectives of Operation Uric were to attack the ZANLA forces in their command and training centre before they could enter Zimbabwe-Rhodesia and to cut off supply routes into the Gaza Province of Mozambique', ' It was also hoped that the destruction of communication and railway lines, roads and bridges as far as 200 miles into Mozambique would affect the economic situation and the morale of those who supported ZANLA and Robert Mugabe', '  Targets were the bridges at Aldeia Da Barragem

kill-ratio of over 20:1', ' It became obvious to the Rhodesian Security Forces that they would soon become technologically inferior to their enemies, who were well equipped and trained by their Soviet

utilities, Electricity Supply Commission (ESCOM, as it was known prior to 1987), latterly Eskom, Johannesburg, South Africa and Hidroelectrica de Cahora Bassa (HCB), a firm owned 15% by the government of Portugal and 85% by Mozambique', '  Equipment was constructed and supplied by ZAMCO, which was a consortium of AEG-Telefunken JV, Brown Boveri Company, and Siemens AG of Germany', '  Brown Boveri subsequently became part of ABB and AEG subsequently became part of Alstom', '  The commercial arrangements also included Electricidade de Moçambique (EDM) which took supply from Cahora Bassa through a wheeling arrangement with Eskom', '  Effectively, Eskom supplied southern Mozambique (Maputo) from the then Eastern Transvaal at 132\xa0kV with the sales deducted from the HCB supply to Eskom', '  The tripartite agreement was suspended due to force majeure when the line from Cahora Bassa was unavailable in the 1980s', '  The system was commissioned in three stages starting in March 1977 with four six-pulse bridges, and in full operation of eight bridges on March 15, 1979', '   Transmission line  The power line runs from the Songo converter station, which is near the hydroelectric station and normally operates as a rectifier, to the Apollo converter station near Johannesburg, which normally operates as an inverter', '  Each of the self-supporting steel towers along the route carries two bundles of four 565\xa0square millimetre (1120\xa0kcmil) cables, one per pole, and a single 117\xa0square millimetre (231\xa0kcmil) grounding conductor', '  There are approximately 7,000\xa0towers with an average span of ', '  The maximum span is  using reinforced towers', ' Earth return for unipolar operation is provided by buried graphite electrodes at each station', ' The DC line has smoothing reactors and surge arrester capacitors at each station', '   Thyristor valves  Cahora Bassa was one of the first HVDC schemes built with thyristor valves from its inception', ' Unusually, the thyristor valves are outdoor mounted', ' In the original installation they were oil filled for both cooling and electrical insulation', '  The only other HVDC scheme in the world equipped in this way from the outset was the first phase – now decommissioned – of the Shin Shinano frequency converter in Japan', '  Each valve tank contains two valves, forming a double-valve connecting the two DC terminals to one single-phase, two-winding converter transformer', '  Each six-pulse bridge contains three such tanks and hence each station contains 24 double-valves', '  The development work for the thyristor valves began in the late 1960s when the only thyristors available at the time were, by today’s standards, small, and were rated only 1', '6\xa0kV each', '  In the first phase of the project (4 bridges at each end) each valve contained 280 such thyristors in series with two in parallel – the largest number ever used in a single HVDC valve', '  Phases 2 and 3 used improved thyristors with a rating of 2', '4\xa0kV each and only required 192 in series per valve – still a large number by modern standards – with two in parallel', '  As a result, each converter station contained a total of 22,656\xa0thyristors', '   Other equipment  The thyristors also had poor transient overcurrent capability, so another unusual feature of the scheme was the existence of overcurrent diverters between the valves and transformers, although these were later decommissioned at the Apollo station', '  AC filters tuned to the 5th, 7th, 11th and 13th harmonics of the 50\xa0Hz power supply are installed at each station, approximately 195\xa0MVAr at Apollo and 210\xa0MVAr at Songo', '  There are two PLC repeater stations: one at Gamaboi in South Africa and one at Catope in Mozambique', '  Repairing the war damage After the civil war ended in 1992, one of the many effects of the decade of strife was the damage to the HVDC transmission lines', ' Nearly all of the 4200\xa0transmission line towers located on the  of line in Mozambique needed to be replaced or refurbished', ' This work was started in 1995 and took until late 1997 to complete', ' The system was restored to full power transmission capacity by 1998', '  Subsequently, Eskom has commenced electricity supply to Mozambique at 400\xa0kV, under terms similar to the original wheeling agreement, from the Arnot Power Station in Mpumalanga, via Swaziland', ' The principal purpose of this infrastructure is to provide bulk electricity supplies to the Mozal Aluminium Smelter operated by BHP', '  The Memorandum of Understanding, signed on 2 November 2007, means that Mozambique will by the end of 2007 be in charge of a project located on its soil but on which it had no control for the past 30 years due to contractual obligations with Portugal', '  The new arrangement gives Mozambique 85 percent of the Cahora Bassa Hydroelectric (HCB) project while Portugal will retain only 15 percent', ' The project has a capacity to produce 2,000 megawatts of electricity and is one of the main suppliers of power to the Southern African Power Pool', '  Mozambique will, however, need to pay US$950 million to the Portuguese government as compensation for the post civil-war reconstruction and maintenance of the dam', '  The civil war resulted in serious damage to the transmission infrastructure, forcing the Portuguese government to pay about US$2', '5 billion out of pocket to repair it', '   Apollo station upgrade  thumb|The Apollo HVDC converter station and distribution lines', ' The Cahora Bassa HVDC line can be seen as the tall pylons on the left', ' The line in the centre of the picture with a single conductor is the electrode line of HVDC Cahora Bassa In 2006 a contract was awarded to ABB to replace the thyristor valves at the Apollo station', '  The outdoor mounting concept was retained, but each of the new housings contains a complete six-pulse bridge instead of only two valves, and the replacement thyristor valves are of a more conventional air insulated, water-cooled design using 125mm, 8', '5\xa0kV thyristors', '  36 such thyristors are connected in series in each valve, without parallel

utilities, Electricity Supply Commission (ESCOM, as it was known prior to 1987), latterly Eskom, Johannesburg, South Africa and Hidroelectrica de Cahora Bassa (HCB), a firm owned 15% by the government of Portugal and 85% by Mozambique', '  Equipment was constructed and supplied by ZAMCO, which was a consortium of AEG-Telefunken JV, Brown Boveri Company, and Siemens AG of Germany', '  Brown Boveri subsequently became part of ABB and AEG subsequently became part of Alstom', '  The commercial arrangements also included Electricidade de Moçambique (EDM) which took supply from Cahora Bassa through a wheeling arrangement with Eskom', '  Effectively, Eskom supplied southern Mozambique (Maputo) from the then Eastern Transvaal at 132\xa0kV with the sales deducted from the HCB supply to Eskom', '  The tripartite agreement was suspended due to force majeure when the line from Cahora Bassa was unavailable in the 1980s', '  The system was commissioned in three stages starting in March 1977 with four six-pulse bridges, and in full operation of eight bridges on March 15, 1979', '   Transmission line  The power line runs from the Songo converter station, which is near the hydroelectric station and normally operates as a rectifier, to the Apollo converter station near Johannesburg, which normally operates as an inverter', '  Each of the self-supporting steel towers along the route carries two bundles of four 565\xa0square millimetre (1120\xa0kcmil) cables, one per pole, and a single 117\xa0square millimetre (231\xa0kcmil) grounding conductor', '  There are approximately 7,000\xa0towers with an average span of ', '  The maximum span is  using reinforced towers', ' Earth return for unipolar operation is provided by buried graphite electrodes at each station', ' The DC line has smoothing reactors and surge arrester capacitors at each station', '   Thyristor valves  Cahora Bassa was one of the first HVDC schemes built with thyristor valves from its inception', ' Unusually, the thyristor valves are outdoor mounted', ' In the original installation they were oil filled for both cooling and electrical insulation', '  The only other HVDC scheme in the world equipped in this way from the outset was the first phase – now decommissioned – of the Shin Shinano frequency converter in Japan', '  Each valve tank contains two valves, forming a double-valve connecting the two DC terminals to one single-phase, two-winding converter transformer', '  Each six-pulse bridge contains three such tanks and hence each station contains 24 double-valves', '  The development work for the thyristor valves began in the late 1960s when the only thyristors available at the time were, by today’s standards, small, and were rated only 1', '6\xa0kV each', '  In the first phase of the project (4 bridges at each end) each valve contained 280 such thyristors in series with two in parallel – the largest number ever used in a single HVDC valve', '  Phases 2 and 3 used improved thyristors with a rating of 2', '4\xa0kV each and only required 192 in series per valve – still a large number by modern standards – with two in parallel', '  As a result, each converter station contained a total of 22,656\xa0thyristors', '   Other equipment  The thyristors also had poor transient overcurrent capability, so another unusual feature of the scheme was the existence of overcurrent diverters between the valves and transformers, although these were later decommissioned at the Apollo station', '  AC filters tuned to the 5th, 7th, 11th and 13th harmonics of the 50\xa0Hz power supply are installed at each station, approximately 195\xa0MVAr at Apollo and 210\xa0MVAr at Songo', '  There are two PLC repeater stations: one at Gamaboi in South Africa and one at Catope in Mozambique', '  Repairing the war damage After the civil war ended in 1992, one of the many effects of the decade of strife was the damage to the HVDC transmission lines', ' Nearly all of the 4200\xa0transmission line towers located on the  of line in Mozambique needed to be replaced or refurbished', ' This work was started in 1995 and took until late 1997 to complete', ' The system was restored to full power transmission capacity by 1998', '  Subsequently, Eskom has commenced electricity supply to Mozambique at 400\xa0kV, under terms similar to the original wheeling agreement, from the Arnot Power Station in Mpumalanga, via Swaziland', ' The principal purpose of this infrastructure is to provide bulk electricity supplies to the Mozal Aluminium Smelter operated by BHP', '  The Memorandum of Understanding, signed on 2 November 2007, means that Mozambique will by the end of 2007 be in charge of a project located on its soil but on which it had no control for the past 30 years due to contractual obligations with Portugal', '  The new arrangement gives Mozambique 85 percent of the Cahora Bassa Hydroelectric (HCB) project while Portugal will retain only 15 percent', ' The project has a capacity to produce 2,000 megawatts of electricity and is one of the main suppliers of power to the Southern African Power Pool', '  Mozambique will, however, need to pay US$950 million to the Portuguese government as compensation for the post civil-war reconstruction and maintenance of the dam', '  The civil war resulted in serious damage to the transmission infrastructure, forcing the Portuguese

began in 2014 and the bridge officially opened 10 November 2018', ' The construction work was carried out by the Chinese China Road and Bridge Corporation; a large part of the project is financed by loans from the Chinese Exim Bank', '  The bridge is the longest suspension bridge on the African continent, replacing the Matadi Bridge, completed in 1983 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, for this distinction', '   History  thumb|Completed bridge piers of the bridge under construction between Maputo and Katembe (view of the southern bank of Katembe; September 2016) The idea of a bridge over the Bay of Maputo – analogous to 25 Abril bridge over the Tagus in Lisbon – had already been planned for many years', ' In 1989, the World Bank financed the urbanisation plan for Maputo, which included the construction of a bridge', '  It was only thanks to the end of the civil war, the numerous investments in the course of the gas and oil boom and the associated strong economic upturn in Mozambique that the Mozambican government was able to tackle the project', ' The government opened an expression of interest procedure in November 2008', '  Following a visit by the then Portuguese Prime Minister José Sócrates in 2010, financing by the Portuguese state was originally planned', "" However, due to the country's massive financial and budgetary crisis, the commitment could not be fulfilled"", "" After a visit by Mozambican President Armando Guebuza to the People's Republic of China in August 2011, both countries agreed on financing of the project by China"", '  The construction work is being commissioned by the state-owned development company Maputo Sul, which is also responsible for the construction of the ring road', ' The construction itself will be carried out by the Chinese building and civil engineering group China Road and Bridge Corporation', ' According to China Daily, up to 2000 jobs are to be created', ' The German engineering company GAUFF Engineering advises on construction supervision', '  The first preparatory construction work began in June 2014 After some delays – especially in the resettlement of residents in the Maputo neighborhood of Malanga – the bridge was inaugurated on 2018-11-15', '   Description of the construction  thumb|Construction work on the northern part of the bridge (September 2017) The four-lane suspension bridge is 3041 metres long and crosses the bay at a height of 60 metres', ' The northern viaduct (foreland bridge) is 1097 meters long, approximately S-shaped and is connected to the Praça 16 de Junho roundabout (connected to the EN1/EN2/EN4 highways) in the Maputo neighborhood of Malanga', ' The southern viaduct is 1264 meters long and consists of precast elements', ' It is directly connected to the road to Ponta do Ouro', '  Originally, pylons were also planned in the bay itself, but they were removed after a change of plan so as not to unnecessarily obstruct shipping traffic', ' A span of 680 metres is bridged without pillars between the two pylons located on the banks', ' This makes the bridge the largest of its kind in Africa', ' The main supporting cables are each connected to a solid anchor block via steel structures in the north and south', ' The extremely high loads of the structure required pile foundations with diameters of 1', '50 m to 2', '20 m', ' The piles reach 110 m deep into the claystone', ' The two pylons are 141 m high, and at a height of about 40 meters there is a crossbar for the roadway', ' The individual prefabricated steel elements for the carriageway are 25', '60 m wide and 12 m long', ' These were fabricated in China and installed from a ship lying near the quay wall', '  The project also included the extension of the road from Katembe to the border town of Ponta do Ouro (129 kilometres) and between Boane and Bela Vista (63 kilometres), including bridges over the Maputo, Futi and Umbelúzi rivers', ' After completing the bridge, extending the EN1 trunk road over the bridge to [Ponta do Ouro] was possible', '   Costs  The costs are expected to amount to about 726 million US dollars, of which 85 percent (681', '6 million US dollars) will be financed by special loans from the Chinese Exim Bank', ' These have a term of 20 years at an interest rate of four percent', ' Another 10 percent (US$72', '5 million) will be awarded on other terms via the Exim Bank, 5 percent will be borne directly by the Mozambican state', '   Impact  thumb|Previously, the direct (and fastest) connection was the ferry of the state shipping company Transmarítimo thumb|Previously, the road between Katembe and Boane to Ponta do Ouro was not asphalted, and could become impassable, especially in the rainy season', ' Although Katembe belongs to the city of Maputo, the spatial separation of the two parts has an immense impact', ' While Maputo, especially the city centre, is heavily urbanised and has a good two million inhabitants on the north bank of the city, most of the buildings on the south side are one-storeyed, the roads are unpaved and there is a lot of undeveloped space', ' An estimated 15,000 to 20,000 people currently live in Katembe', ' The transport takes place between both shores either by car and passenger ferry or via another detour via Boane (main roads EN2/EN200)', '  With the completion of the bridge and the extension of the road to Ponta do Ouro, a massive population growth of up to 400,000 inhabitants is forecasted for Katembe', ' The entire southern shore is also to be urbanised', ' According to the strategic plan for the urbanization of Katembe by the engineering office Betar, approximately 9,510,000 square meters (and thus 58', '9 percent of the total area) are to be reserved for residential buildings', ' 3,270,000 square meters (20', '3 percent of the total area) are earmarked for the service sector, 1,880,000 square meters (11', '7 percent) for industry', '  The extension of the road to Ponta do Ouro and KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa) is intended to massively shorten the travel time', ' A joint tourism plan with the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal and the Kingdom of Swaziland aims to attract more visitors to southern Mozambique', '   Criticism  The high costs of building the bridge and the connected road to Boane and Ponta do Ouro have been massively criticised by Mozambican publicist Carlos Nuno Castel-Branco', ' In his opinion, the bridge would cost a seventh of the money if it were built in China', ' Former mayor of Maputo, Eneas Comiche, also criticizes the high costs', ' Scientist Américo Matavele pointed out that Castel-Branco did not take into account the costs of the connected roads in his invoices', '  According to an analysis report by the Economist Intelligence Unit, an analysis company of The Economist Group, interest rates on the loans of the Chinese Exim Bank are also relatively high', ' The Mozambican government prefers these, although it has far more favourable financing options at its disposal', ' The criticism of the bridge construction project is illustrated', '  In early November 2014, numerous Mozambican workers went on strike for several days', ' They complained about poor working conditions, wrong contracts and late salary payments', '  Furthermore, numerous families are affected by resettlements in the course of the construction project', ' The contractor Maputo Sul estimates the number of families to be relocated at 920, for which new four-storey houses with two to four-room apartments are to be built as a replacement', ' Resettlements began in 2015', '   Awards  The bridge has received worldwide attention and recognition in specialist circles', ' In addition to the FULTON Award 2017 and 2019 - the highest distinction for concrete structures in the southern states of Africa - in June 2019 in New York the bridge was also awarded the ""Award of Merit"" of the

Bay of Maputo – analogous to 25 Abril bridge over the Tagus in Lisbon – had already been planned for many years', ' In 1989, the World Bank financed the urbanisation plan for Maputo, which included the construction of a bridge', '  It was only thanks to the end of the civil war, the numerous investments in the course of the gas and oil boom and the associated strong economic upturn in Mozambique that the Mozambican government was able to tackle the project', ' The government opened an expression of interest procedure in November 2008', '  Following a visit by the then Portuguese Prime Minister José Sócrates in 2010, financing by the Portuguese state was originally planned', "" However, due to the country's massive financial and budgetary crisis, the commitment could not be fulfilled"", "" After a visit by Mozambican President Armando Guebuza to the People's Republic of China in August 2011, both countries agreed on financing of the project by China"", '  The construction work is being commissioned by the state-owned development company Maputo Sul, which is also responsible for the construction of the ring road', ' The construction itself will be carried out by the Chinese building and civil engineering group China Road and Bridge Corporation', ' According to China Daily, up to 2000 jobs are to be created', ' The German engineering company GAUFF Engineering advises on construction supervision', '  The first preparatory construction work began in June 2014 After some delays – especially in the resettlement of residents in the Maputo

16 de Junho roundabout (connected to the EN1/EN2/EN4 highways) in the Maputo neighborhood of Malanga', ' The southern viaduct is 1264 meters long and consists of precast elements', ' It is directly connected to the road to Ponta do Ouro', '  Originally, pylons were also planned in the bay itself, but they were removed after a change of plan so as not to unnecessarily obstruct shipping traffic', ' A span of 680 metres is bridged without pillars between the two pylons located on the banks', ' This makes the bridge the largest of its kind in Africa', ' The main supporting cables are each

the Kingdom of Swaziland aims to attract more visitors to southern Mozambique', '   Criticism  The high costs of building the bridge and the connected road to Boane and Ponta do Ouro have been massively criticised by Mozambican publicist Carlos Nuno Castel-Branco', ' In his opinion, the bridge would cost a seventh of the money if it were built in China', ' Former mayor of Maputo, Eneas

analysis report by the Economist Intelligence Unit, an analysis company of The Economist Group, interest rates on the loans of the Chinese Exim Bank are also relatively high', ' The Mozambican government prefers these, although it has far more favourable financing options at its disposal', ' The criticism of the bridge construction project is illustrated', '  In early November 2014,

a site at the Afungi peninsula near Palma, had hired at least five security companies, namely Arkhe, GardaWorld, Blue Mountain, Control Risks and G4S', ' Total SE maintained that its security contractors were generally unarmed', ' The Total SE site had been described as a project which could completely change the local economy, as it would provide a massive revenue to the Mozambican

the construction of a bridge', '  It was only thanks to the end of the civil war, the numerous investments in the course of the gas and oil boom and the associated strong economic upturn in Mozambique that the Mozambican government was able to tackle the project', ' The government opened an expression of interest procedure in November 2008', '  Following a visit by the then Portuguese Prime Minister José Sócrates in 2010, financing by the Portuguese state was originally planned', "" However, due to the country's massive financial and budgetary crisis, the commitment could not be fulfilled"", "" After a visit by Mozambican President Armando Guebuza to the People's Republic of China in August 2011, both countries agreed on financing of the project by China"", '  The construction work is being commissioned by the state-owned development company Maputo Sul, which is also responsible for the construction of the ring road', ' The construction itself will be carried out by the Chinese building and civil engineering group China Road and Bridge Corporation', ' According to China Daily, up to 2000 jobs are to be created', ' The German engineering company GAUFF Engineering advises on construction supervision', '  The first preparatory construction work began in June 2014 After some delays – especially in the resettlement of residents in the Maputo

the Kingdom of Swaziland aims to attract more visitors to southern Mozambique', '   Criticism  The high costs of building the bridge and the connected road to Boane and Ponta do Ouro have been massively criticised by Mozambican publicist Carlos Nuno Castel-Branco', ' In his opinion, the bridge would cost a seventh of the money if it were built in China', ' Former mayor of Maputo, Eneas
