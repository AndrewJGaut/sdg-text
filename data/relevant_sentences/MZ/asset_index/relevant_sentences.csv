Likewise, in 2015 the Government of Mozambique released Agenda 2025, which highlighted the goals for the countries long term social and economic growth as a framework for international aid partners around the world. This plan, along with a medium term expenditure framework and a strategic health sector plan laid forth a plan for the country to develop, monitor, and evaluate poverty reduction and social progression initiatives. Through the duration of these and more social programming in Mozambique post-civil war, an emphasis was placed on improving dispersion of resources for the prevention and treatment of Mozambique's most prevalent health challenges, as well as towards improvement in public health education initiatives as a means of prevention. Medicines The  National Health Service depends on external financing to pay for medicine. Prior to the commencement of the Mozambican Civil War in 1975, the country had already been facing conditions of hardship since the 1960s. During this time, the country was plagued with violence and poverty in accordance with its struggle for independence from Portugal. In 1996, this initiative began helping governments reduce the debt they were incurring through public health spending, effectively encouraging them to promote these healthy initiatives in their countries. The funds that governments saved with the help of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative was left in the hands of poverty-reduction strategy papers (PRSP), whose primary responsibility was to ensure access of the poor to social resources - like health care - food security, and government transparency. In Mozambique, two specific initiatives the PRSP pushed were (1) increasing community knowledge surrounding health challenges, diseases, and resources; and (2) preventing and slowing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases around the country through public health campaigns that increased public knowledge about modes of transmission and personal protection against STDs."
