LS-2014-7#-00000292,1.0,"Design   The series of twists and turns that the Mbhashe River takes through the Collywobbles means that at one point on the river where it twists close together a concrete dam in the northern bend allowed the impounding of the river to create a lake from which water is diverted via a 1.4 km long by 4.6 m diameter dual lined tunnel operating at 14 bars to the powerhouse on the southern bend. At full load the power station consumes 38 cumecs of water. Modifications   In 1985 cracks developed in the first 50 metres of the concrete-lined tunnel, the resulting loss of water causing landslides. Boreholes were drilled on the hillside to prevent a build-up of water but it was only semi-successful. To increase the output of the power station it is supplemented by water from the upstream Ncora power station on the Tsomo River in the neighbouring Greater Kei catchment, as well as from a diversion tunnel from the lake behind the Ncora Dam, that bypasses the Ncora power station. The water diverted at Ncora Dam takes approximately two days to reach Colley Wobbles. This inter catchment transfer of water ranged between about 115 and 150 million cubic metres annually over the last four years prior to 2008.

LS-2004-4#-00000301,1.0,"In such a dry country, dams and irrigation are extremely important: the largest dam is the Gariep on the Orange River. North of the Witwatersrand, where the land starts to slope down towards the north, the drainage is into the Limpopo River and from there into the Indian Ocean. Agriculture, which includes viniculture and fruit-growing, therefore depends on irrigation from rivers with sources in the mountains, which are frequently covered in snow during winter. The largest of the rivers is the Tugela, portion of whose waters are pumped over the escarpment on to the Highveld to supplement the water supply to the large industrial cities of Gauteng. Usually the shoals break up and the fish disappear into deeper water around Durban. It is probably the most inhospitable area in South Africa, because of its aridity, infertile soil and highly saline groundwater. Note that the Benguela current does not originate from Antarctic waters in the South Atlantic Ocean, but from upwelling of water from the cold depths of the Atlantic Ocean against the west coast of the continent. The temperature of the water and its fertility is due to its upwelling, along the coast. A lack of fresh water, however, prevented permanent settlement here until relatively recently.

North of the Witwatersrand, where the land starts to slope down towards the north, the drainage is into the Limpopo River and from there into the Indian Ocean. Agriculture, which includes viniculture and fruit-growing, therefore depends on irrigation from rivers with sources in the mountains, which are frequently covered in snow during winter. The largest of the rivers is the Tugela, portion of whose waters are pumped over the escarpment on to the Highveld to supplement the water supply to the large industrial cities of Gauteng. Usually the shoals break up and the fish disappear into deeper water around Durban. It is probably the most inhospitable area in South Africa, because of its aridity, infertile soil and highly saline groundwater. Note that the Benguela current does not originate from Antarctic waters in the South Atlantic Ocean, but from upwelling of water from the cold depths of the Atlantic Ocean against the west coast of the continent. The temperature of the water and its fertility is due to its upwelling, along the coast. A lack of fresh water, however, prevented permanent settlement here until relatively recently.

At full load the power station consumes 38 cumecs of water. Modifications   In 1985 cracks developed in the first 50 metres of the concrete-lined tunnel, the resulting loss of water causing landslides. Boreholes were drilled on the hillside to prevent a build-up of water but it was only semi-successful. To increase the output of the power station it is supplemented by water from the upstream Ncora power station on the Tsomo River in the neighbouring Greater Kei catchment, as well as from a diversion tunnel from the lake behind the Ncora Dam, that bypasses the Ncora power station. The water diverted at Ncora Dam takes approximately two days to reach Colley Wobbles. This inter catchment transfer of water ranged between about 115 and 150 million cubic metres annually over the last four years prior to 2008.

The Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP) was established, with the objective of supplying water to the Gauteng region of South Africa and for hydroelectric power to meet the needs of Lesotho. The project envisages diverting water in the highlands of the country through three dams; two under Phase I (PhaseI A -Katse Dam and Phase II - Mohale Dam) and the Polihali Dam under Phase II. The water supply meets the needs of the Gauteng region which encompasses the mining and industrial cities of Johannesburg and Pretoria.

The Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP) was established, with the objective of supplying water to the Gauteng region of South Africa and for hydroelectric power to meet the needs of Lesotho. The project envisages diverting water in the highlands of the country through three dams; two under Phase I (PhaseI A -Katse Dam and Phase II - Mohale Dam) and the Polihali Dam under Phase II. The water supply meets the needs of the Gauteng region which encompasses the mining and industrial cities of Johannesburg and Pretoria.

The Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP) was established, with the objective of supplying water to the Gauteng region of South Africa and for hydroelectric power to meet the needs of Lesotho. The project envisages diverting water in the highlands of the country through three dams; two under Phase I (PhaseI A -Katse Dam and Phase II - Mohale Dam) and the Polihali Dam under Phase II. The water supply meets the needs of the Gauteng region which encompasses the mining and industrial cities of Johannesburg and Pretoria.

At full load the power station consumes 38 cumecs of water. Modifications   In 1985 cracks developed in the first 50 metres of the concrete-lined tunnel, the resulting loss of water causing landslides. Boreholes were drilled on the hillside to prevent a build-up of water but it was only semi-successful. To increase the output of the power station it is supplemented by water from the upstream Ncora power station on the Tsomo River in the neighbouring Greater Kei catchment, as well as from a diversion tunnel from the lake behind the Ncora Dam, that bypasses the Ncora power station. The water diverted at Ncora Dam takes approximately two days to reach Colley Wobbles. This inter catchment transfer of water ranged between about 115 and 150 million cubic metres annually over the last four years prior to 2008.

Subsequently, Director of Public Works, requested an engineer to  examine the potential of the project as a possible means to supplement the water supply needs in South African gold mines. The Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP) was established, with the objective of supplying water to the Gauteng region of South Africa and for hydroelectric power to meet the needs of Lesotho. The project envisages diverting water in the highlands of the country through three dams; two under Phase I (PhaseI A -Katse Dam and Phase II - Mohale Dam) and the Polihali Dam under Phase II. The water supply meets the needs of the Gauteng region which encompasses the mining and industrial cities of Johannesburg and Pretoria. Both the ""socle"" and the toe-slab incorporate movement joints consisting of  compressible materials and a PVC water stop. The intake for water transfer is located  upstream of the dam face on the left bank."

LS-2004-4#-00000301,1.0,"In such a dry country, dams and irrigation are extremely important: the largest dam is the Gariep on the Orange River. North of the Witwatersrand, where the land starts to slope down towards the north, the drainage is into the Limpopo River and from there into the Indian Ocean. Agriculture, which includes viniculture and fruit-growing, therefore depends on irrigation from rivers with sources in the mountains, which are frequently covered in snow during winter. The largest of the rivers is the Tugela, portion of whose waters are pumped over the escarpment on to the Highveld to supplement the water supply to the large industrial cities of Gauteng. Usually the shoals break up and the fish disappear into deeper water around Durban. It is probably the most inhospitable area in South Africa, because of its aridity, infertile soil and highly saline groundwater. Note that the Benguela current does not originate from Antarctic waters in the South Atlantic Ocean, but from upwelling of water from the cold depths of the Atlantic Ocean against the west coast of the continent. The temperature of the water and its fertility is due to its upwelling, along the coast. A lack of fresh water, however, prevented permanent settlement here until relatively recently. In the Port Elizabeth region, national NGO Living Lands had in cooperation with an agricultural insurance company, planted 3.7 million trees as of late 2015, in order to restore the water catchment system and halt erosion.Barbee, Jeff. black wattle, Port Jackson willow, Hakea, Lantana and Jacaranda) posing a significant threat to the native biodiversity and the already scarce water resources."
