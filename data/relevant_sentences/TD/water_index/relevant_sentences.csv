a NW-SE alignment that could extend to the Great Rift Valley; however, the relationship between these fault systems has not been conclusively demonstrated', '  The basement of the Tibesti is composed of granite, diorite and schist, one of six exposures of Precambrian crystalline rock in North Africa', ' These are overlaid by sandstone of the Paleozoic era, while the peaks consist of volcanic rock', ' The continental hotspot activity began as early as the Oligocene, although most of the volcanic rock dates from the Lower Miocene to the Pleistocene and, in places, to the Holocene', ' Due to the comparatively slow movement of the African plate—roughly between  per year since the Lower Miocene—there is no relationship between the age of the volcanoes and their dimensions, geographic distribution or alignment, in contrast to hotspots such as the Hawaiian–Emperor and Cook-Austral seamount chains', ' This phenomenon is also seen in Martian volcanoes, particularly Elysium Mons', ' Early volcanic activity created trap basalt formations that extend tens of kilometers and stack up to  thick', ' Basanite and andesite are also found in the volcanic layer', ' More recently in geologic time, volcanic activity has deposited dacite, rhyolite and ignimbrite, as well as trachyte and trachyandesite', ' This trend towards the production of more felsic, viscous lavas could be a sign of a waning mantle plume', '  Geomorphology  [[File:Tibesti', 'gif|thumb|left|alt=Animation showing the phases of volcanic activity in the Tibesti Mountains|Animation showing the phases of volcanic activity in the Tibesti Mountains]]  Volcanic activity in the Tibesti took place in several phases', ' In the first phase, uplift and extension of the Precambrian basement occurred in the central area', ' The first structure to be formed was probably Tarso Abeki, followed by Tarso Tamertiou, Tarso Tieroko, Tarso Yega, Tarso Toon and Ehi Yéy', ' The product of this early volcanic activity has been completely obscured by later eruptions', ' In the second phase, the volcanic activity moved north and east, forming Tarso Ourari and the ignimbrite bases of the vast tarsos, as well as Emi Koussi to the southeast', ' Thereafter, during the third phase, the outpouring of lava and ejecta deposits increased from Tarso Yega, Tarso Toon, Tarso Tieroko and Ehi Yéy; the collapse of these structures formed the first calderas', ' This phase also saw the formation of the Bounaï lava dome and Tarso Voon', ' To the east, the lava flows formed the large plateaus of Tarso Emi Chi, Tarso Ahon and Tarso Mohi', ' Emi Koussi increased in height', ' The fourth phase saw the formation of Tarso Toussidé and the lava flows of Tarso Tôh in the west, the collapse of the caldera on the summit of Tarso Voon and associated ejecta deposits in the center, and the decline in lava production in the east, with the exception of Emi Koussi, which continued to rise', ' In the fifth phase, volcanic activity became much more localized and lava production continued to wane', ' Calderas formed on top of Tarso Toussidé and Emi Koussi, and the lava domes Ehi Sosso and Ehi Mousgou appeared', ' Finally, in the sixth phase, Pic Toussidé formed on the western rim of several pre-Trou au Natron calderas, along with new lava flows, including Timi on the northern slope of Tarso Toussidé', ' With scarce time for erosion, these lava flows have a dark, youthful appearance', '  [[File:Pic Toussidé ASTER', 'jpg|thumb|alt=Satellite image of the darker, more recent lava rock|Satellite image of the more recent lava rock, in black, with Toussidé volcano (center) and the Trou au Natron crater (bottom right)]]  The Trou au Natron and Doon Kidimi craters have formed even more recently, with the former dissecting the earlier Toussidé calderas', ' Lava flows, minor pyroclastic deposits, and the appearance of small cinder cones, and the formation of the Era Kohor crater are the most recent volcanic activities on Emi Koussi', '  there are reports of volcanic activity in various parts of the massif, including hot springs at the Soborom geothermal field and fumaroles on Tarso Voon, Yi Yerra near Emi Koussi and Pic Toussidé', ' Carbonate deposits in the Trou au Natron and Era Kohor craters are also representative of more recent volcanic activity', '  The study of fluvial terraces has revealed coarse sand and gravel alternating with terraces of silt, clay and fine sand', ' This alternation highlights repeated changes in the dominant fluvial or wind patterns in the valleys of Tibesti during the Quaternary Period', ' The phases of erosion and sendimentation are indicative of the climate alternating between dry and wet conditions, the latter of which fostered vegetation in the Tibesti that was likely significantly denser than that which exists today', ' Furthermore, the discovery of calcified charophyta (particularly of the family Characeae) and gastropod fossils in Trou au Natron indicates the presence of a lake at least  deep during the Late Pleistocene', ' These phenomena are associated with various changes in climate, most notably during the last glacial maximum, which increased precipitation and reduced evaporation due to lower temperatures', ' In fact, the Tibesti supplied a considerable amount of water to the Paleolake Chad until the 5th millennium BC', '  Climate The Tibesti climate is substantially less dry than that of the surrounding Sahara Desert, but rainfall events are highly variable from year to year', ' In the south of the range, this variation is largely due to oscillations of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which steadily moves northward toward northern Chad from November until August, accompanied by humid monsoonal air', ' Normally, the ITCZ repels the Harmattan, a dry trade wind that blows west or southwest from the Sahara Desert, and brings rainfall to southern Tibesti', ' However, sometimes the front retires early, before reaching the Tibesti, leaving its southern portion dry', ' In the arid northern Tibesti, where the monsoon has little influence, storms are caused by episodic Sahara-Sudanese weather systems', ' For example, between 1957 and 1968, Bardaï, on the northern flank of the range, saw an average of  of precipitation annually, yet some years were completely dry while others saw  of rainfall', ' In general, the range receives less than  of rainfall per year', ' However, precipitation increases with altitude; for example  Trou au Natron  receives  annually', ' When the rainfall coincides with low temperatures, it can fall as snow', ' This occurs, on average, once every seven years', '  The average monthly maximum temperature is  in the central Tibesti Mountains, while the average monthly minimum is ', ' Lows of  are not uncommon', ' Bardaï, located  above sea level, experiences average temperatures ranging between  in January, between  in April, and between  in August', ' The combination of high temperatures and low humidity results in potentially high evaporation rates, ranging from  in January to  in May, parching many enneris before they can exit the mountain range', '  Flora and fauna Like an island surrounded by ocean, the ecology of the Tibesti Mountains is distinguishable from that of the surrounding desert', ' As such, the mountains lie within their own biome, the  Tibesti-Jebel Uweinat montane xeric woodlands ecoregion, along with the Jebel Uweinat, a disjunct mountain range that also rises from the Sahara  to the east', ' Much of the ecoregion remains unexplored due to its remoteness and persistent political instability, yet it is known to contain a number of endemic and endangered species', ' Indeed, the isolation of the region is a benefit to its flora and fauna, serving as a sort of refuge, allowing plants to grow untrammeled and animals to roam unmolested', ' Nevertheless, hunting is unregulated in the region, and

century', ' These clans controlled the palm groves, and made a peace pact with the Tomagra, a nearby clan of camel herders who practiced Ghazw', ' It was upon the agreement to this pact at the end of the 16th century that power was consolidated under the Derdé, the principal regulator of the clans, whose appointment is always made from the Tomagra clan', '  There is evidence of early Daza settlements in the Tibesti; however, these early clans—the Goga, Kida, Terbouna and Obokina—were assimilated into later Daza clans, who arrived in the Tibesti between the 15th and 18th centuries,

attack ultimately backfired, however, as it resulted in the prompt reaction of Habré, who sent 2,000 soldiers to support the GUNT forces', ' Although the Libyans were only partially repelled from the

as Emi Koussi to the southeast', ' Thereafter, during the third phase, the outpouring of lava and ejecta deposits increased from Tarso Yega, Tarso Toon, Tarso Tieroko and Ehi Yéy; the collapse of

as Emi Koussi to the southeast', ' Thereafter, during the third phase, the outpouring of lava and ejecta deposits increased from Tarso Yega, Tarso Toon, Tarso Tieroko and Ehi Yéy; the collapse of

resulted from a mantle plume in the craton of the African lithosphere, which is about  thick', ' This tectonic uplift may have been accompanied by the opening, and subsequent closure via subduction, of a rift zone', ' A system of regional faults, although partially obscured by the volcanic product, has two distinct orientations: a NNE-SSW alignment that could be an extension of Cameroon line, and a NW-SE alignment that could extend to the Great Rift Valley; however, the relationship between these fault systems has not been conclusively demonstrated', '  The basement of the Tibesti is composed of granite, diorite and schist, one of six exposures of Precambrian crystalline rock in North Africa', ' These are overlaid by sandstone of the Paleozoic era, while the peaks consist of volcanic rock', ' The continental hotspot activity began as early as the Oligocene, although most of the volcanic rock dates from the Lower Miocene to the Pleistocene and, in places, to the Holocene', ' Due to the comparatively slow movement of the African plate—roughly between  per year since the Lower Miocene—there is no relationship between the age of the volcanoes and their dimensions, geographic distribution or alignment, in contrast to hotspots such as the Hawaiian–Emperor and Cook-Austral seamount chains', ' This phenomenon is also seen in Martian volcanoes, particularly Elysium Mons', ' Early volcanic activity created trap basalt formations that extend tens of kilometers and stack up to  thick', ' Basanite and andesite are also found in the volcanic layer', ' More recently in geologic time, volcanic activity has deposited dacite, rhyolite and ignimbrite, as well as trachyte and trachyandesite', ' This trend towards the production of more felsic, viscous lavas could be a sign of a waning mantle plume', '  Geomorphology  [[File:Tibesti', 'gif|thumb|left|alt=Animation showing the phases of volcanic activity in the Tibesti Mountains|Animation showing the phases of volcanic activity in the Tibesti Mountains]]  Volcanic activity in the Tibesti took place in several phases', ' In the first phase, uplift and extension of the Precambrian basement occurred in the central area', ' The first structure to be formed was probably Tarso Abeki, followed by Tarso Tamertiou, Tarso Tieroko, Tarso Yega, Tarso Toon and Ehi Yéy', ' The product of this early volcanic activity has been completely obscured by later eruptions', ' In the second phase, the volcanic activity moved north and east, forming Tarso Ourari and the ignimbrite bases of the vast tarsos, as well as Emi Koussi to the southeast', ' Thereafter, during the third phase, the outpouring of lava and ejecta deposits increased from Tarso Yega, Tarso Toon, Tarso Tieroko and Ehi Yéy; the collapse of these structures formed the first calderas', ' This phase also saw the formation of the Bounaï lava dome and Tarso Voon', ' To the east, the lava flows formed the large plateaus of Tarso Emi Chi, Tarso Ahon and Tarso Mohi', ' Emi Koussi increased in height', ' The fourth phase saw the formation of Tarso Toussidé and the lava flows of Tarso Tôh in the west, the collapse of the caldera on the summit of Tarso Voon and associated ejecta deposits in the center, and the decline in lava production in the east, with the exception of Emi Koussi, which continued to rise', ' In the fifth phase, volcanic activity became much more localized and lava production continued to wane', ' Calderas formed on top of Tarso Toussidé and Emi Koussi, and the lava domes Ehi Sosso and Ehi Mousgou appeared', ' Finally, in the sixth phase, Pic Toussidé formed on the western rim of several pre-Trou au Natron calderas, along with new lava flows, including Timi on the northern slope of Tarso Toussidé', ' With scarce time for erosion, these lava flows have a dark, youthful appearance', '  [[File:Pic Toussidé ASTER', 'jpg|thumb|alt=Satellite image of the darker, more recent lava rock|Satellite image of the

former dissecting the earlier Toussidé calderas', ' Lava flows, minor pyroclastic deposits, and the appearance of small cinder cones, and the formation of the Era Kohor crater are the most recent volcanic activities on Emi Koussi', '  there are reports of volcanic activity in various parts of the massif, including hot springs at the Soborom geothermal field and fumaroles on Tarso Voon, Yi Yerra near Emi Koussi and Pic Toussidé', ' Carbonate deposits in the Trou au Natron and Era Kohor craters are also representative of more recent volcanic activity', '  The study of fluvial terraces has revealed coarse sand and gravel alternating with terraces of silt, clay and fine sand', ' This alternation highlights repeated changes in the dominant fluvial or wind patterns in the valleys of Tibesti during the Quaternary Period', ' The phases of erosion and sendimentation are indicative of the climate alternating between dry and wet conditions, the latter of which fostered vegetation in the Tibesti that was likely significantly denser than that which exists today', ' Furthermore, the discovery of calcified charophyta (particularly of the family Characeae) and gastropod fossils in Trou au Natron indicates the presence of a lake at least  deep during the Late Pleistocene', ' These phenomena are associated with various changes in climate, most notably during the last glacial maximum, which increased precipitation and reduced evaporation due to lower temperatures', ' In fact, the Tibesti supplied a considerable amount of water to the Paleolake Chad until the 5th millennium BC', '  Climate The Tibesti climate is substantially less dry than that of the surrounding Sahara Desert, but rainfall events are highly variable from year to year', ' In the south of the range, this variation is largely due to oscillations of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which steadily moves northward toward northern Chad from November until August, accompanied by humid monsoonal air', ' Normally, the ITCZ repels the Harmattan, a dry trade wind that blows west or southwest from the Sahara Desert, and brings rainfall to southern Tibesti', ' However, sometimes the front retires early, before reaching the Tibesti, leaving its southern portion dry', ' In the arid northern Tibesti, where the monsoon has little influence, storms are caused by episodic Sahara-Sudanese weather systems', ' For example, between 1957 and 1968, Bardaï, on the northern flank of the range, saw an average of  of precipitation annually, yet some years were completely dry while others saw  of rainfall', ' In general, the range receives less than  of rainfall per year', ' However, precipitation increases with altitude; for example  Trou au Natron  receives  annually', ' When the rainfall coincides with low temperatures, it can fall as snow', ' This occurs, on average, once every seven years', '  The average monthly maximum temperature is  in the central Tibesti Mountains, while the average monthly minimum is ', ' Lows of  are not uncommon', ' Bardaï, located  above sea level, experiences average temperatures ranging between  in January, between  in April, and between  in August', ' The combination of high temperatures and low humidity results in potentially high evaporation rates, ranging from  in January to  in May, parching many enneris before they can exit the mountain range', '  Flora and fauna Like an island surrounded by ocean, the ecology of the Tibesti Mountains is distinguishable from that of the surrounding desert', ' As such, the mountains lie within their own biome, the  Tibesti-Jebel Uweinat montane xeric woodlands ecoregion, along with the Jebel Uweinat, a disjunct mountain range that also rises from the Sahara  to the east', ' Much of the ecoregion remains unexplored due to its remoteness and persistent political instability, yet it is known to contain a number of endemic and endangered species', ' Indeed, the isolation of the

activity has been completely obscured by later eruptions', ' In the second phase, the volcanic activity moved north and east, forming Tarso Ourari and the ignimbrite bases of the vast tarsos, as well as Emi Koussi to the southeast', ' Thereafter, during the third phase, the outpouring of lava and ejecta deposits increased from Tarso Yega, Tarso Toon, Tarso Tieroko and Ehi Yéy; the collapse of

variable from year-to-year and decade-to-decade.However, none of the rivers travel long distances, as the water evaporates in the desert heat or seeps into the ground, although the latter may flow great distances through subterranean aquifers.The water mainly originates from the storms that periodically rage over the mountains.Their basins are separated by an high watershed that runs from Tarso Tieroko in the west to Tarso Mohi in the east.At the bottom of many canyons are gueltas, wetlands that accumulate water mainly during storms.Above , enneri beds sometimes contain sequential pools of water that.The water is replenished several times a year during flooding, and salinity levels are low.The Mare de Zoui is a small permanent body of water above sea level, located in the northern part of the mountains in the wadi of the Enneri Bardagué, east of Bardaï.A dozen hot springs are also located at the Soborom geothermal field on the northwest side of Tarso Voon, where water emerges at temperatures ranging between.Furthermore, the discovery of calcified charophyta (particularly of the family Characeae) and gastropod fossils in Trou au Natron indicates the presence of a lake at least deep during the Late Pleistocene.In fact, the Tibesti supplied a considerable amount of water to the Paleolake Chad until the 5th millennium BC.Acacia nilotica) grows near these water basins.) grows in the open water.Although the lake appears rich in phytoplankton, it has not been thoroughly studied.The gueltas are flushed periodically each year by stormwater, maintaining low salinity and supporting several species of freshwater fish.This water is thought to be sourced sourced from the Tibesti Mountains, from where it flows underground before surfacing at these springs.On the plains of Borkou, some fields are irrigated, where cattle, goats and dromedaries can drink.Fishing is possible in the water holes"

resulted from a mantle plume in the craton of the African lithosphere, which is about  thick', ' This tectonic uplift may have been accompanied by the opening, and subsequent closure via subduction, of a rift zone', ' A system of regional faults, although partially obscured by the volcanic product, has two distinct orientations: a NNE-SSW alignment that could be an extension of Cameroon line, and a NW-SE alignment that could extend to the Great Rift Valley; however, the relationship between these fault systems has not been conclusively demonstrated', '  The basement of the Tibesti is composed of granite, diorite and schist, one of six exposures of Precambrian crystalline rock in North Africa', ' These are overlaid by sandstone of the Paleozoic era, while the peaks consist of volcanic rock', ' The continental hotspot activity began as early as the Oligocene, although most of the volcanic rock dates from the Lower Miocene to the Pleistocene and, in places, to the Holocene', ' Due to the comparatively slow movement of the African plate—roughly between  per year since the Lower Miocene—there is no relationship between the age of the volcanoes and their dimensions, geographic distribution or alignment, in contrast to hotspots such as the Hawaiian–Emperor and Cook-Austral seamount chains', ' This phenomenon is also seen in Martian volcanoes, particularly Elysium Mons', ' Early volcanic activity created trap basalt formations that extend tens of kilometers and stack up to  thick', ' Basanite and andesite are also found in the volcanic layer', ' More recently in geologic time, volcanic activity has deposited dacite, rhyolite and ignimbrite, as well as trachyte and trachyandesite', ' This trend towards the production of more felsic, viscous lavas could be a sign of a waning mantle plume', '  Geomorphology  [[File:Tibesti', 'gif|thumb|left|alt=Animation showing the phases of volcanic activity in the Tibesti Mountains|Animation showing the phases of volcanic activity in the Tibesti Mountains]]  Volcanic activity in the Tibesti took place in several phases', ' In the first phase, uplift and extension of the Precambrian basement occurred in the central area', ' The first structure to be formed was probably Tarso Abeki, followed by Tarso Tamertiou, Tarso Tieroko, Tarso Yega, Tarso Toon and Ehi Yéy', ' The product of this early volcanic activity has been completely obscured by later eruptions', ' In the second phase, the volcanic activity moved north and east, forming Tarso Ourari and the ignimbrite bases of the vast tarsos, as well as Emi Koussi to the southeast', ' Thereafter, during the third phase, the outpouring of lava and ejecta deposits increased from Tarso Yega, Tarso Toon, Tarso Tieroko and Ehi Yéy; the collapse of these structures formed the first calderas', ' This phase also saw the formation of the Bounaï lava dome and Tarso Voon', ' To the east, the lava flows formed the large plateaus of Tarso Emi Chi, Tarso Ahon and Tarso Mohi', ' Emi Koussi increased in height', ' The fourth phase saw the formation of Tarso Toussidé and the lava flows of Tarso Tôh in the west, the collapse of the caldera on the summit of Tarso Voon and associated ejecta deposits in the center, and the decline in lava production in the east, with the exception of Emi Koussi, which continued to rise', ' In the fifth phase, volcanic activity became much more localized and lava production continued to wane', ' Calderas formed on top of Tarso Toussidé and Emi Koussi, and the lava domes Ehi Sosso and Ehi Mousgou appeared', ' Finally, in the sixth phase, Pic Toussidé formed on the western rim of several pre-Trou au Natron calderas, along with new lava flows, including Timi on the northern slope of Tarso Toussidé', ' With scarce time for erosion, these lava flows have a dark, youthful appearance', '  [[File:Pic Toussidé ASTER', 'jpg|thumb|alt=Satellite image of the darker, more recent lava rock|Satellite image of the

former dissecting the earlier Toussidé calderas', ' Lava flows, minor pyroclastic deposits, and the appearance of small cinder cones, and the formation of the Era Kohor crater are the most recent volcanic activities on Emi Koussi', '  there are reports of volcanic activity in various parts of the massif, including hot springs at the Soborom geothermal field and fumaroles on Tarso Voon, Yi Yerra near Emi Koussi and Pic Toussidé', ' Carbonate deposits in the Trou au Natron and Era Kohor craters are also representative of more recent volcanic activity', '  The study of fluvial terraces has revealed coarse sand and gravel alternating with terraces of silt, clay and fine sand', ' This alternation highlights repeated changes in the dominant fluvial or wind patterns in the valleys of Tibesti during the Quaternary Period', ' The phases of erosion and sendimentation are indicative of the climate alternating between dry and wet conditions, the latter of which fostered vegetation in the Tibesti that was likely significantly denser than that which exists today', ' Furthermore, the discovery of calcified charophyta (particularly of the family Characeae) and gastropod fossils in Trou au Natron indicates the presence of a lake at least  deep during the Late Pleistocene', ' These phenomena are associated with various changes in climate, most notably during the last glacial maximum, which increased precipitation and reduced evaporation due to lower temperatures', ' In fact, the Tibesti supplied a considerable amount of water to the Paleolake Chad until the 5th millennium BC', '  Climate The Tibesti climate is substantially less dry than that of the surrounding Sahara Desert, but rainfall events are highly variable from year to year', ' In the south of the range, this variation is largely due to oscillations of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which steadily moves northward toward northern Chad from November until August, accompanied by humid monsoonal air', ' Normally, the ITCZ repels the Harmattan, a dry trade wind that blows west or southwest from the Sahara Desert, and brings rainfall to southern Tibesti', ' However, sometimes the front retires early, before reaching the Tibesti, leaving its southern portion dry', ' In the arid northern Tibesti, where the monsoon has little influence, storms are caused by episodic Sahara-Sudanese weather systems', ' For example, between 1957 and 1968, Bardaï, on the northern flank of the range, saw an average of  of precipitation annually, yet some years were completely dry while others saw  of rainfall', ' In general, the range receives less than  of rainfall per year', ' However, precipitation increases with altitude; for example  Trou au Natron  receives  annually', ' When the rainfall coincides with low temperatures, it can fall as snow', ' This occurs, on average, once every seven years', '  The average monthly maximum temperature is  in the central Tibesti Mountains, while the average monthly minimum is ', ' Lows of  are not uncommon', ' Bardaï, located  above sea level, experiences average temperatures ranging between  in January, between  in April, and between  in August', ' The combination of high temperatures and low humidity results in potentially high evaporation rates, ranging from  in January to  in May, parching many enneris before they can exit the mountain range', '  Flora and fauna Like an island surrounded by ocean, the ecology of the Tibesti Mountains is distinguishable from that of the surrounding desert', ' As such, the mountains lie within their own biome, the  Tibesti-Jebel Uweinat montane xeric woodlands ecoregion, along with the Jebel Uweinat, a disjunct mountain range that also rises from the Sahara  to the east', ' Much of the ecoregion remains unexplored due to its remoteness and persistent political instability, yet it is known to contain a number of endemic and endangered species', ' Indeed, the isolation of the
