sign of a waning mantle plume', '  Geomorphology  [[File:Tibesti', 'gif|thumb|left|alt=Animation showing the phases of volcanic activity in the Tibesti Mountains|Animation showing the phases of volcanic activity in the Tibesti Mountains]]  Volcanic activity in the Tibesti took place in several phases', ' In the first phase, uplift and extension of the Precambrian basement occurred in the central area', ' The first structure to be formed was probably Tarso Abeki, followed by Tarso Tamertiou, Tarso Tieroko, Tarso Yega, Tarso Toon and Ehi Yéy', ' The product of this early volcanic activity has been completely obscured by later eruptions', ' In the second phase, the volcanic activity moved north and east, forming Tarso Ourari and the ignimbrite bases of the vast tarsos, as well as Emi Koussi to the southeast', ' Thereafter, during the third phase, the outpouring of lava and ejecta deposits increased from Tarso Yega, Tarso Toon, Tarso Tieroko and Ehi Yéy; the collapse of these structures formed the first calderas', ' This phase also saw the formation of the Bounaï lava dome and Tarso Voon', ' To the east, the lava flows formed the large plateaus of Tarso Emi Chi, Tarso Ahon and Tarso Mohi', ' Emi Koussi increased in height', ' The fourth phase saw the formation of Tarso Toussidé and the lava flows of Tarso Tôh in the west, the collapse of the caldera on the summit of Tarso Voon and associated ejecta deposits in the center, and the decline in lava production in the east, with the exception of Emi Koussi, which continued to rise', ' In the fifth phase, volcanic activity became much more localized and lava production continued to wane', ' Calderas formed on top of Tarso Toussidé and Emi Koussi, and the lava domes Ehi Sosso and Ehi Mousgou appeared', ' Finally, in the sixth phase, Pic Toussidé formed on the western rim of several pre-Trou au Natron calderas, along with new lava flows, including Timi on the northern slope of Tarso Toussidé', ' With scarce time for erosion, these lava flows have a dark, youthful appearance', '  [[File:Pic Toussidé ASTER', 'jpg|thumb|alt=Satellite image of the darker, more recent lava rock|Satellite image of the

former dissecting the earlier Toussidé calderas', ' Lava flows, minor pyroclastic deposits, and the appearance of small cinder cones, and the formation of the Era Kohor crater are the most recent volcanic activities on Emi Koussi', '  there are reports of volcanic activity in various parts of the massif, including hot springs at the Soborom geothermal field and fumaroles on Tarso Voon, Yi Yerra near Emi Koussi and Pic Toussidé', ' Carbonate deposits in the Trou au Natron and Era Kohor craters are also representative of more recent volcanic activity', '  The study of fluvial terraces has revealed coarse sand and gravel alternating with terraces of silt, clay and fine sand', ' This alternation highlights repeated changes in the dominant fluvial or wind patterns in the valleys of Tibesti during the Quaternary Period', ' The phases of erosion and sendimentation are indicative of the climate alternating between dry and wet conditions, the latter of which fostered vegetation in the Tibesti that was likely significantly denser than that which exists today', ' Furthermore, the discovery of calcified charophyta (particularly of the family Characeae) and gastropod fossils in Trou au Natron indicates the presence of a lake at least  deep during the Late Pleistocene', ' These phenomena are associated with various changes in climate, most notably during the last glacial maximum, which increased precipitation and reduced evaporation due to lower temperatures', ' In fact, the Tibesti supplied a considerable amount of water to the Paleolake Chad until the 5th millennium BC', '  Climate The Tibesti climate is substantially less dry than that of the surrounding Sahara Desert, but rainfall events are highly variable from year to year', ' In the south of the range, this variation is largely due to oscillations of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which steadily moves northward toward northern Chad from November until August, accompanied by humid monsoonal air', ' Normally, the ITCZ repels the Harmattan, a dry trade wind that blows west or southwest from the Sahara Desert, and brings rainfall to southern Tibesti', ' However, sometimes the front retires early, before reaching the Tibesti, leaving its southern portion dry', ' In the arid northern Tibesti, where the monsoon has little influence, storms are caused by episodic Sahara-Sudanese weather systems', ' For example, between 1957 and 1968, Bardaï, on the northern flank of the range, saw an average of  of precipitation annually, yet some years were completely dry while others saw  of rainfall', ' In general, the range receives less than  of rainfall per year', ' However, precipitation increases with altitude; for example  Trou au Natron  receives  annually', ' When the rainfall coincides with low temperatures, it can fall as snow', ' This occurs, on average, once every seven years', '  The average monthly maximum temperature is  in the central Tibesti Mountains, while the average monthly minimum is ', ' Lows of  are not uncommon', ' Bardaï, located  above sea level, experiences average temperatures ranging between  in January, between  in April, and between  in August', ' The combination of high temperatures and low humidity results in potentially high evaporation rates, ranging from  in January to  in May, parching many enneris before they can exit the mountain range', '  Flora and fauna Like an island surrounded by ocean, the ecology of the Tibesti Mountains is distinguishable from that of the surrounding desert', ' As such, the mountains lie within their own biome, the  Tibesti-Jebel Uweinat montane xeric woodlands ecoregion, along with the Jebel Uweinat, a disjunct mountain range that also rises from the Sahara  to the east', ' Much of the ecoregion remains unexplored due to its remoteness and persistent political instability, yet it is known to contain a number of endemic and endangered species', ' Indeed, the isolation of the

semi-nomadic, moving between the mountains and other regions, and thus the Tibesti may have no more than 10,000 to 15,000 permanent residents', '  Traditional Toubou life is punctuated by the seasons, divided between animal husbandry and agriculture', ' Twentieth-century anthropological studies show Toubou, particularly around palm groves, living in primitive round huts built with stone walls bound by mortar or clay, or built from clay or salt blocks', ' In the highlands, the buildings were built of stone, forming circles  in diameter and  high, which served as shelters for goats, or as

century', ' These clans controlled the palm groves, and made a peace pact with the Tomagra, a nearby clan of camel herders who practiced Ghazw', ' It was upon the agreement to this pact at the end of the 16th century that power was consolidated under the Derdé, the principal regulator of the clans, whose appointment is always made from the Tomagra clan', '  There is evidence of early Daza settlements in the Tibesti; however, these early clans—the Goga, Kida, Terbouna and Obokina—were assimilated into later Daza clans, who arrived in the Tibesti between the 15th and 18th centuries,

the northwest and center-east, and the Derdekichia (literally, ""descendants of the chief,"" the products of a union between an Arna Souinga and an Emmeouia) in the north', ' The Tibesti then played the role of an impregnable mountain stronghold for the newcomers', ' Meanwhile, constant migration between the north and southwest of Chad, along with significant mixing of the populations, forged a significant degree of cohesion among the Toubou ethnicities', ' Periods of territorial expansion in the 10th and 13th centuries and periods of recession in the 15th and 16th centuries likely coincided

attack ultimately backfired, however, as it resulted in the prompt reaction of Habré, who sent 2,000 soldiers to support the GUNT forces', ' Although the Libyans were only partially repelled from the

have formed vast plateaus that overlie Paleozoic sandstone', ' The volcanic activity was the result of a continental hotspot that arose during the Oligocene and continued in some places until the Holocene, creating fumaroles, hot springs, mud pools and deposits of natron and sulfur', ' Erosion has shaped volcanic spires and carved an extensive network of canyons through which run rivers subject to highly irregular flows that are rapidly lost to the desert sands', '  Tibesti, which means ""place where the mountain people live"", is the domain of the Toubou people', ' The Toubou live

resulted from a mantle plume in the craton of the African lithosphere, which is about  thick', ' This tectonic uplift may have been accompanied by the opening, and subsequent closure via subduction, of a rift zone', ' A system of regional faults, although partially obscured by the volcanic product, has two distinct orientations: a NNE-SSW alignment that could be an extension of Cameroon line, and a NW-SE alignment that could extend to the Great Rift Valley; however, the relationship between these fault systems has not been conclusively demonstrated', '  The basement of the Tibesti is composed of granite, diorite and schist, one of six exposures of Precambrian crystalline rock in North Africa', ' These are overlaid by sandstone of the Paleozoic era, while the peaks consist of volcanic rock', ' The continental hotspot activity began as early as the Oligocene, although most of the volcanic rock dates from the Lower Miocene to the Pleistocene and, in places, to the Holocene', ' Due to the comparatively slow movement of the African plate—roughly between  per year since the Lower Miocene—there is no relationship between the age of the volcanoes and their dimensions, geographic distribution or alignment, in contrast to hotspots such as the Hawaiian–Emperor and Cook-Austral seamount chains', ' This phenomenon is also seen in Martian volcanoes, particularly Elysium Mons', ' Early volcanic activity created trap basalt formations that extend tens of kilometers and stack up to  thick', ' Basanite and andesite are also found in the volcanic layer', ' More recently in geologic time, volcanic activity has deposited dacite, rhyolite and ignimbrite, as well as trachyte and trachyandesite', ' This trend towards the production of more felsic, viscous lavas could be a sign of a waning mantle plume', '  Geomorphology  [[File:Tibesti', 'gif|thumb|left|alt=Animation showing the phases of volcanic activity in the Tibesti Mountains|Animation showing the phases of volcanic activity in the Tibesti Mountains]]  Volcanic activity in the Tibesti took place in several phases', ' In the first phase, uplift and extension of the Precambrian basement occurred in the central area', ' The first structure to be formed was probably Tarso Abeki, followed by Tarso Tamertiou, Tarso Tieroko, Tarso Yega, Tarso Toon and Ehi Yéy', ' The product of this early volcanic activity has been completely obscured by later eruptions', ' In the second phase, the volcanic activity moved north and east, forming Tarso Ourari and the ignimbrite bases of the vast tarsos, as well as Emi Koussi to the southeast', ' Thereafter, during the third phase, the outpouring of lava and ejecta deposits increased from Tarso Yega, Tarso Toon, Tarso Tieroko and Ehi Yéy; the collapse of these structures formed the first calderas', ' This phase also saw the formation of the Bounaï lava dome and Tarso Voon', ' To the east, the lava flows formed the large plateaus of Tarso Emi Chi, Tarso Ahon and Tarso Mohi', ' Emi Koussi increased in height', ' The fourth phase saw the formation of Tarso Toussidé and the lava flows of Tarso Tôh in the west, the collapse of the caldera on the summit of Tarso Voon and associated ejecta deposits in the center, and the decline in lava production in the east, with the exception of Emi Koussi, which continued to rise', ' In the fifth phase, volcanic activity became much more localized and lava production continued to wane', ' Calderas formed on top of Tarso Toussidé and Emi Koussi, and the lava domes Ehi Sosso and Ehi Mousgou appeared', ' Finally, in the sixth phase, Pic Toussidé formed on the western rim of several pre-Trou au Natron calderas, along with new lava flows, including Timi on the northern slope of Tarso Toussidé', ' With

former dissecting the earlier Toussidé calderas', ' Lava flows, minor pyroclastic deposits, and the appearance of small cinder cones, and the formation of the Era Kohor crater are the most recent volcanic activities on Emi Koussi', '  there are reports of volcanic activity in various parts of the massif, including hot springs at the Soborom geothermal field and fumaroles on Tarso Voon, Yi Yerra near Emi Koussi and Pic Toussidé', ' Carbonate deposits in the Trou au Natron and Era Kohor craters are also representative of more recent volcanic activity', '  The study of fluvial terraces has revealed coarse sand and gravel alternating with terraces of silt, clay and fine sand', ' This alternation highlights repeated changes in the dominant fluvial or wind patterns in the valleys of Tibesti during the Quaternary Period', ' The phases of erosion and sendimentation are indicative of the climate alternating between dry and wet conditions, the latter of which fostered vegetation in the Tibesti that was likely significantly denser than that which exists today', ' Furthermore, the discovery of calcified charophyta (particularly of the family Characeae) and gastropod fossils in Trou au Natron indicates the presence of a lake at least  deep during the Late Pleistocene', ' These phenomena are associated with various changes in climate, most notably during the last glacial maximum, which increased precipitation and reduced evaporation due to lower temperatures', ' In fact, the Tibesti supplied a considerable amount of water to the Paleolake Chad until the 5th millennium BC', '  Climate The Tibesti climate is substantially less dry than that of the surrounding Sahara Desert, but rainfall events are highly variable from year to year', ' In the south of the range, this variation is largely due to oscillations of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which steadily moves northward toward northern Chad from November until August, accompanied by humid monsoonal air', ' Normally, the ITCZ repels the Harmattan, a dry trade wind that blows west or southwest from the Sahara Desert, and brings rainfall to southern Tibesti', ' However, sometimes the front retires early, before reaching the Tibesti, leaving its southern portion dry', ' In the arid northern Tibesti, where the monsoon has little influence, storms are caused by episodic Sahara-Sudanese weather systems', ' For example, between 1957 and 1968, Bardaï, on the northern flank of the range, saw an average of  of precipitation annually, yet some years were completely dry while others saw  of

and east of the country, leaving the Tibesti region largely alone', '  In 1969, Goukouni Oueddei, a Teda leader, and Hissène Habré, a Daza leader, emerged from the Tibesti to form the Second Liberation Army', "" In April 1974, the Second Liberation Army captured Bardaï from the Chadian government and took hostage the French archeologist Françoise Claustre, German doctor Christophe Staewen and Marc Combe, an assistant to Claustre's husband, and held them in the mountains"", "" Staewen's wife and two soldiers of the Chadian army were killed"", ' The West German government quickly paid the ransom and Staewen was released', ' The French government sent the military officer Pierre Galopin to negotiate with the rebels, but he was captured by the rebels and executed in April 1975', ' Marc Combe was able to escape in May 1975', "" The remaining hostages were released in January 1977 in Tripoli after France acceded to the rebel's ransom demand"", ' The hostage incident, known as ""L\'affaire Claustre"", caused a rift between the French and Chadian governments', '  Another rift formed between Goukouni and Habré, which by 1976 had spread to the Second Liberation Army, leaving one side commanded by Habré and the other commanded by Goukouni and supported by Libya', "" In June 1977, Goukouni's forces attacked the Chadian government stronghold in Bardaï"", ' The rebels also attacked Zouar', ' These battles resulted in the death of 300 government troops', ' Bardaï surrendered to the rebels on July 4, while Zouar was evacuated', "" The Chadian government, led by Félix Malloum since Tombalbaye's overthrow in 1975, signed a peace agreement with Habré in 1978, although fighting with other rebel groups, many aligned with Libya, continued"", '  Tibesti War  [[File:Map

ostensibly over the Aouzou Strip, a  borderland between Chad and Libya that extends into the Tibesti Mountains and is rumored to contain uranium deposits', "" In 1980, Libya used the strip as a base from which stage an attack, led by Goukouni, on the Chadian capital, N'Djamena, located in southern Chad and controlled by Habré"", "" N'Djamena was toppled in December; however, under considerable international pressure, Libya withdrew from southern Chad in late 1981, and Habré's Armed Forces of the North (FAN) took control of the entirety of Chad with the exception of the Tibesti, where Goukouni retreated with his Libyan-backed Government of National Unity (GUNT) forces"", ' Goukouni then established a National Peace Government in Bardaï and proclaimed it the legitimate government of Chad', ' Habré attacked the GUNT in the Tibesti in both December 1982 and January 1983 but was repelled on both occasions', ' Although fighting intensified over the next several months, the mountains remained under the control of the GUNT and Libyan forces', '  By 1986, following a series of military defeats, the GUNT had begun to disintegrate along with relations between Goukouni and Libya', ' In December, Goukouni was arrested by the Libyans, which spurred his troops to attack Libyan positions in the Tibesti, forcing the Libyans to withdraw', ' Libya sought to retake Bardaï and Zouar, and sent a task-force of 2,000 troops with T-62 tanks and heavy support by the Libyan Air Force into the Tibesti', ' The offensive started successfully, expelling the GUNT from its key strongholds', ' The attack ultimately backfired, however, as it resulted in the prompt reaction of Habré, who sent 2,000 soldiers to support the GUNT forces', ' Although the Libyans were only partially repelled from the Tibesti, the broader campaign was a great strategic victory, as it transformed a civil war into a national war against a foreign invader, stimulating a sense of national unity never before seen in Chad', ' After a series of defeats in northeastern Chad, Libyan forces withdrew fully from the Tibesti in March 1987', '  MDJT War  Following a decade of relative peace, in late 1997 the Tibesti saw the formation of the Movement for Democracy and Justice in Chad (MDJT), a rebel group opposed to Chadian president Idriss Déby', ' Numbering around 1,000 fighters at its peak between 2000 and 2001, and financed by Libyan Teda clans and the Libyan government, the MDJT was able to take control of several towns in the Tibesti', ' Battles with the Chadian National Army (ANT) were particularly violent between 1998 and 2002, resulting in the deaths of between 500 and 850 MDJT rebels and a comparable number of ANT soldiers at locales across northern Chad, including Bardaï', ' Although civilian casualties were relatively limited, many civilians were killed and injured by landmines, and the war resulted in the displacement of a large portion of the local population', '  Between 1998 and 2010 the MDJT had established a weak government in the Tibesti region, functionally independent from that of Chad', ' In 2002, however, weakened by its isolation in the Tibesti and from a series of military defeats, the MDJT split into several factions following the death of its leader, Youssouf Togoïmi', ' In 2005, under pressure from Libya, the ""most legitimate"" MDJT faction signed a peace agreement with the Chadian government, yet the war continued, albeit at a lower intensity', ' From 2009 to 2010, the last of the MDJT rebels surrendered to the Chadian government', ' The legacy of decades of war continues to burden the Tibesti with a lack of government, a warrior culture, and a landscape strewn with thousands of landmines', '  Gold rush Gold was discovered in the Tibesti Mountains in 2012, attracting prospectors from across the Sahel', ' The arrival of migrants has led to violent conflicts with the Teda locals, a problem exacerbated by an influx of weaponry to the region due to the  wars in Darfur and Libya', ' Migration has also increased drug traffic, with the Tibesti lying along the trans-Saharan smuggling route for South American cocaine destined for Europe', ' Nevertheless, the gold discovery has benefited the impoverished region economically', ' Many Tibesti residents have been able to purchase goods such as cars, televisions and satellite telephones that they could not otherwise afford', ' ""If by the grace of God, gold had not appeared we would not even have anything to eat"", remarked one Tibesti prospector', '  Scientific

the Tibesti in 1869', ' While Nachtigal provided an accurate description of the population, his expedition was fiercely opposed by the Toubou, and his account discouraged any new adventure into the Tibesti for over 40 years', ' Later expeditions carried out between 1920 and 1970 yielded valuable information on the geology and petrology of the range', ' The French anthropologist Charles le Cœur and his wife Marguerite, a geographer, lived among the Teda of Tibesti between 1933 and 1935', ' Le Cœur was the first to closely study the Tibesti populace, but the outbreak of World War II prevented him from publishing his research', ' French Colonel Jean Chapelle published a book on the Toubou and their lifestyle in 1957', ' In 1965, the Free University of Berlin opened a geomorphological research station in Bardaï; however, research was slowed due to the Chadian Civil War, and the station was ultimately closed in 1974', ""  Although the Tibesti is one of the world's most significant examples of intracontinental volcanism, ongoing political instability and the presence of landmines means that, today, geologic research often must be conducted on the basis of satellite images and comparison with research on Martian volcanoes"", ' Little public geologic research had been conducted in the Tibesti Mountains until the work of Gourgaud and Vincent in 2004; however, an expedition in 2015 sought to assess the feasibility of establishing a new geoscience research station in Bardaï', '  Climbing history Although not an alpine climb, Gustav Nachtigal ascended to  elevation as he traversed a pass abutting Pic Toussidé during his exploration of the Tibesti in 1869', ' The Englishman Wilfred Thesiger summited the highest mountain in the range, the  Emi Koussi, in 1938', ' In 1948, the Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research mounted an expedition under Edouard Wyss-Dunant, which scaled both the peak and needle of Botoum, at  and , respectively', '  In 1957, Peter Steele led a University of Cambridge expedition that sought to conquer Tarso Tieroko, which Thesiger had described as ""probably the most beautiful peak in Tibesti""', ' After climbing two peaks situated on a ridge to the north, they attempted Tieroko, but just  from the summit, they were faced with a vertical, crumbling rock wall and were forced to descend', ' Following this defeat, they took the opportunity to climb Emi Koussi, 19 years after its first ascent by Thesiger, and also Pic Woubou, a prominent spire located between Bardaï and Aouzou', ' Seven years later, in 1965, a team led by the Englishman Doug Scott succeeded in climbing Tieroko', '  In 1963, an expedition under the Italian Guido Monzino ascended a peak in the massif of the Aiguilles of Sissé which, despite rising only  above ground level, proved ""very difficult""', ' The Englishman Eamon ""Ginge"" Fullen scaled Bikku Bitti, the highest peak in Libya at , in 2005, capping a successful Guinness World Records

the comparatively slow movement of the African plate—roughly between  per year since the Lower Miocene—there is no relationship between the age of the volcanoes and their dimensions, geographic distribution or alignment, in contrast to hotspots such as the Hawaiian–Emperor and Cook-Austral seamount chains', ' This phenomenon is also seen in Martian volcanoes, particularly Elysium Mons', '

activity has been completely obscured by later eruptions', ' In the second phase, the volcanic activity moved north and east, forming Tarso Ourari and the ignimbrite bases of the vast tarsos, as well as Emi Koussi to the southeast', ' Thereafter, during the third phase, the outpouring of lava and ejecta deposits increased from Tarso Yega, Tarso Toon, Tarso Tieroko and Ehi Yéy; the collapse of these structures formed the first calderas', ' This phase also saw the formation of the Bounaï lava dome and Tarso Voon', ' To the east, the lava flows formed the large plateaus of Tarso Emi Chi, Tarso Ahon and Tarso Mohi', ' Emi Koussi increased in height', ' The fourth phase saw the formation of Tarso Toussidé and the lava flows of Tarso Tôh in the west, the collapse of the caldera on the summit of Tarso Voon and associated ejecta deposits in the center, and the decline in lava production in the east, with the exception of Emi Koussi, which continued to rise', ' In the fifth phase, volcanic activity became much more localized and lava production continued to wane', ' Calderas formed on top of Tarso Toussidé and Emi Koussi, and the lava domes Ehi Sosso and Ehi Mousgou appeared', ' Finally, in the sixth phase, Pic Toussidé formed on the western rim of several pre-Trou au Natron calderas, along with new lava flows, including Timi on the northern slope of Tarso Toussidé', ' With

Tibesti during the Quaternary Period', ' The phases of erosion and sendimentation are indicative of the climate alternating between dry and wet conditions, the latter of which fostered vegetation in the Tibesti that was likely significantly denser than that which exists today', ' Furthermore, the discovery of calcified charophyta (particularly of the family Characeae) and gastropod fossils in Trou au Natron indicates the presence of a lake at least  deep during the Late Pleistocene', ' These phenomena are associated with various changes in climate, most notably during the last glacial maximum, which increased precipitation and reduced evaporation due to lower temperatures', ' In fact, the Tibesti supplied a considerable amount of water to the Paleolake Chad until the 5th millennium BC', '  Climate The Tibesti climate is substantially less dry than that of the surrounding Sahara Desert, but rainfall events are highly variable from year to year', ' In the south of the range, this variation is largely due to oscillations of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which steadily moves northward toward northern Chad from November until August, accompanied by humid monsoonal air', ' Normally, the ITCZ repels the Harmattan, a dry trade wind that blows west or southwest from the Sahara Desert, and brings rainfall to southern Tibesti', ' However, sometimes the front retires early, before reaching the Tibesti, leaving its southern portion dry', ' In the arid northern Tibesti, where the monsoon has little influence, storms are caused by episodic Sahara-Sudanese weather systems', ' For example, between 1957 and 1968, Bardaï, on the northern flank of the range, saw an average of  of precipitation annually, yet some years were completely dry while others saw  of

within their own biome, the  Tibesti-Jebel Uweinat montane xeric woodlands ecoregion, along with the Jebel Uweinat, a disjunct mountain range that also rises from the Sahara  to the east', ' Much of the ecoregion remains unexplored due to its remoteness and persistent political instability, yet it is known to contain a number of endemic and endangered species', ' Indeed, the isolation of the

distribution or alignment, in contrast to hotspots such as the Hawaiian–Emperor and Cook-Austral seamount chains', ' This phenomenon is also seen in Martian volcanoes, particularly Elysium Mons', ' Early volcanic activity created trap basalt formations that extend tens of kilometers and stack up to  thick', ' Basanite and andesite are also found in the volcanic layer', ' More recently in geologic time, volcanic activity has deposited dacite, rhyolite and ignimbrite, as well as trachyte and trachyandesite', ' This trend towards the production of more felsic, viscous lavas could be a sign of a waning mantle plume', '  Geomorphology  [[File:Tibesti', 'gif|thumb|left|alt=Animation showing the phases of volcanic activity in the Tibesti Mountains|Animation showing the phases of volcanic activity in the Tibesti Mountains]]  Volcanic activity in the Tibesti took place in several phases', ' In the first phase, uplift and extension of the Precambrian basement occurred in the central area', ' The first structure to be formed was probably Tarso Abeki, followed by Tarso Tamertiou, Tarso Tieroko, Tarso Yega, Tarso Toon and Ehi Yéy', ' The product of this early volcanic activity has been completely obscured by later eruptions', ' In the second phase, the volcanic activity moved north and east, forming Tarso Ourari and the ignimbrite bases of the vast tarsos, as well as Emi Koussi to the southeast', ' Thereafter, during the third phase, the outpouring of lava and ejecta deposits increased from Tarso Yega, Tarso Toon, Tarso Tieroko and Ehi Yéy; the collapse of these structures formed the first calderas', ' This phase also saw the formation of the Bounaï lava dome and Tarso Voon', ' To the east, the lava flows formed the large plateaus of Tarso Emi Chi, Tarso Ahon and Tarso Mohi', ' Emi Koussi increased in height', ' The fourth phase saw the formation of Tarso Toussidé and the lava flows of Tarso Tôh in the west, the collapse of the caldera on the summit of Tarso Voon and associated ejecta deposits in the center, and the decline in lava production in the east, with the exception of Emi Koussi, which continued to rise', ' In the fifth phase, volcanic activity became much more localized and lava production continued to wane', ' Calderas formed on top of Tarso Toussidé and Emi Koussi, and the lava domes Ehi Sosso and Ehi Mousgou appeared', ' Finally, in the sixth phase, Pic Toussidé formed on the western rim of several pre-Trou au Natron calderas, along with new lava flows, including Timi on the northern slope of Tarso Toussidé', ' With scarce time for erosion, these lava flows have a dark, youthful appearance', '  [[File:Pic Toussidé ASTER', 'jpg|thumb|alt=Satellite image of the darker, more recent lava rock|Satellite image of the

former dissecting the earlier Toussidé calderas', ' Lava flows, minor pyroclastic deposits, and the appearance of small cinder cones, and the formation of the Era Kohor crater are the most recent volcanic activities on Emi Koussi', '  there are reports of volcanic activity in various parts of the massif, including hot springs at the Soborom geothermal field and fumaroles on Tarso Voon, Yi Yerra near Emi Koussi and Pic Toussidé', ' Carbonate deposits in the Trou au Natron and Era Kohor craters are also representative of more recent volcanic activity', '  The study of fluvial terraces has revealed coarse sand and gravel alternating with terraces of silt, clay and fine sand', ' This alternation highlights repeated changes in the dominant fluvial or wind patterns in the valleys of Tibesti during the Quaternary Period', ' The phases of erosion and sendimentation are indicative of the climate alternating between dry and wet conditions, the latter of which fostered vegetation in the Tibesti that was likely significantly denser than that which exists today', ' Furthermore, the discovery of calcified charophyta (particularly of the family Characeae) and gastropod fossils in Trou au Natron indicates the presence of a lake at least  deep during the Late Pleistocene', ' These phenomena are associated with various changes in climate, most notably during the last glacial maximum, which increased precipitation and reduced evaporation due to lower temperatures', ' In fact, the Tibesti supplied a considerable amount of water to the Paleolake Chad until the 5th millennium BC', '  Climate The Tibesti climate is substantially less dry than that of the surrounding Sahara Desert, but rainfall events are highly variable from year to year', ' In the south of the range, this variation is largely due to oscillations of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which steadily moves northward toward northern Chad from November until August, accompanied by humid monsoonal air', ' Normally, the ITCZ repels the Harmattan, a dry trade wind that blows west or southwest from the Sahara Desert, and brings rainfall to southern Tibesti', ' However, sometimes the front retires early, before reaching the Tibesti, leaving its southern portion dry', ' In the arid northern Tibesti, where the monsoon has little influence, storms are caused by episodic Sahara-Sudanese weather systems', ' For example, between 1957 and 1968, Bardaï, on the northern flank of the range, saw an average of  of precipitation annually, yet some years were completely dry while others saw  of rainfall', ' In general, the range receives less than  of rainfall per year', ' However, precipitation increases with altitude; for example  Trou au Natron  receives  annually', ' When the rainfall coincides with low temperatures, it can fall as snow', ' This occurs, on average, once every seven years', '  The average monthly maximum temperature is  in the central Tibesti Mountains, while the average monthly minimum is ', ' Lows of  are not uncommon', ' Bardaï, located  above sea level, experiences average temperatures ranging between  in January, between  in April, and between  in August', ' The combination of high temperatures and low humidity results in potentially high evaporation rates, ranging from  in January to  in May, parching many enneris before they can exit the mountain range', '  Flora and fauna Like an island surrounded by ocean, the ecology of the Tibesti Mountains is distinguishable from that of the surrounding desert', ' As such, the mountains lie within their own biome, the  Tibesti-Jebel Uweinat montane xeric woodlands ecoregion, along with the Jebel Uweinat, a disjunct mountain range that also rises from the Sahara  to the east', ' Much of the ecoregion remains unexplored due to its remoteness and persistent political instability, yet it is known to contain a number of endemic and endangered species', ' Indeed, the isolation of the

century', ' These clans controlled the palm groves, and made a peace pact with the Tomagra, a nearby clan of camel herders who practiced Ghazw', ' It was upon the agreement to this pact at the end of the 16th century that power was consolidated under the Derdé, the principal regulator of the clans, whose appointment is always made from the Tomagra clan', '  There is evidence of early Daza settlements in the Tibesti; however, these early clans—the Goga, Kida, Terbouna and Obokina—were assimilated into later Daza clans, who arrived in the Tibesti between the 15th and 18th centuries,

volcanic activities on Emi Koussi', '  there are reports of volcanic activity in various parts of the massif, including hot springs at the Soborom geothermal field and fumaroles on Tarso Voon, Yi Yerra near Emi Koussi and Pic Toussidé', ' Carbonate deposits in the Trou au Natron and Era Kohor craters are also representative of more recent volcanic activity', '  The study of fluvial terraces has revealed coarse sand and gravel alternating with terraces of silt, clay and fine sand', ' This alternation highlights repeated changes in the dominant fluvial or wind patterns in the valleys of Tibesti during the Quaternary Period', ' The phases of erosion and sendimentation are indicative of the climate alternating between dry and wet conditions, the latter of which fostered vegetation in the Tibesti that was likely significantly denser than that which exists today', ' Furthermore, the discovery of calcified charophyta (particularly of the family Characeae) and gastropod fossils in Trou au Natron indicates the presence of a lake at least  deep during the Late Pleistocene', ' These phenomena are associated with various changes in climate, most notably during the last glacial maximum, which increased precipitation and reduced evaporation due to lower temperatures', ' In fact, the Tibesti supplied a considerable amount of water to the Paleolake Chad until the 5th millennium BC', '  Climate The Tibesti climate is substantially less dry than that of the surrounding Sahara Desert, but rainfall events are highly variable from year to year', ' In the south of the range, this variation is largely due to oscillations of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which steadily moves northward toward northern Chad from November until August, accompanied by humid monsoonal air', ' Normally, the ITCZ repels the Harmattan, a dry trade wind that blows west or southwest from the Sahara Desert, and brings rainfall to southern Tibesti', ' However, sometimes the front retires early, before reaching the Tibesti, leaving its southern portion dry', ' In the arid northern Tibesti, where the monsoon has little influence, storms are caused by episodic Sahara-Sudanese weather systems', ' For example, between 1957 and 1968, Bardaï, on the northern flank of the range, saw an average of  of precipitation annually, yet some years were completely dry while others saw  of rainfall', ' In general, the range receives less than  of rainfall per year', ' However, precipitation increases with altitude; for example  Trou au Natron  receives  annually', ' When the rainfall coincides with low temperatures, it can fall as snow', ' This occurs, on average, once every seven years', '  The average monthly maximum temperature is  in the central Tibesti Mountains, while the average monthly minimum is ', ' Lows of  are not uncommon', ' Bardaï, located  above sea level, experiences average temperatures ranging between  in January, between  in April, and between  in August', ' The combination of high temperatures and low humidity results in potentially high evaporation rates, ranging from  in January to  in May, parching many enneris before they can exit the mountain range', '  Flora and fauna Like an island surrounded by ocean, the ecology of the Tibesti Mountains is distinguishable from that of the surrounding desert', ' As such, the mountains lie within their own biome, the  Tibesti-Jebel Uweinat montane xeric woodlands ecoregion, along with the Jebel Uweinat, a disjunct mountain range that also rises from the Sahara  to the east', ' Much of the ecoregion remains unexplored due to its remoteness and persistent political instability, yet it is known to contain a number of endemic and endangered species', ' Indeed, the isolation of the region is a benefit to its flora and fauna, serving as a sort of refuge, allowing plants to grow untrammeled and animals to roam unmolested', ' Nevertheless, hunting is unregulated in the region, and

semi-nomadic, moving between the mountains and other regions, and thus the Tibesti may have no more than 10,000 to 15,000 permanent residents', '  Traditional Toubou life is punctuated by the seasons, divided between animal husbandry and agriculture', ' Twentieth-century anthropological studies show Toubou, particularly around palm groves, living in primitive round huts built with stone walls bound by mortar or clay, or built from clay or salt blocks', ' In the highlands, the buildings were built of stone, forming circles  in diameter and  high, which served as shelters for goats, or as

these clans were the Cerdegua, Zouia, Kossseda (nicknamed yobat or ""hunters of well water""), and possibly the Ederguia, although the Ederguia\'s origin may be Zaghawa and only go back to the 17th century', ' These clans controlled the palm groves, and made a peace pact with the Tomagra, a nearby clan of camel herders who practiced Ghazw', ' It was upon the agreement to this pact at the end of the 16th century that power was consolidated under the Derdé, the principal regulator of the clans, whose appointment is always made from the Tomagra clan', '  There is evidence of early Daza settlements in the Tibesti; however, these early clans—the Goga, Kida, Terbouna and Obokina—were assimilated into later Daza clans, who arrived in the Tibesti between the 15th and 18th centuries,

the northwest and center-east, and the Derdekichia (literally, ""descendants of the chief,"" the products of a union between an Arna Souinga and an Emmeouia) in the north', ' The Tibesti then played the role of an impregnable mountain stronghold for the newcomers', ' Meanwhile, constant migration between the north and southwest of Chad, along with significant mixing of the populations, forged a significant degree of cohesion among the Toubou ethnicities', ' Periods of territorial expansion in the 10th and 13th centuries and periods of recession in the 15th and 16th centuries likely coincided

resulted from a mantle plume in the craton of the African lithosphere, which is about  thick', ' This tectonic uplift may have been accompanied by the opening, and subsequent closure via subduction, of a rift zone', ' A system of regional faults, although partially obscured by the volcanic product, has two distinct orientations: a NNE-SSW alignment that could be an extension of Cameroon line, and a NW-SE alignment that could extend to the Great Rift Valley; however, the relationship between these fault systems has not been conclusively demonstrated', '  The basement of the Tibesti is composed of granite, diorite and schist, one of six exposures of Precambrian crystalline rock in North Africa', ' These are overlaid by sandstone of the Paleozoic era, while the peaks consist of volcanic rock', ' The continental hotspot activity began as early as the Oligocene, although most of the volcanic rock dates from the Lower Miocene to the Pleistocene and, in places, to the Holocene', ' Due to the comparatively slow movement of the African plate—roughly between  per year since the Lower Miocene—there is no relationship between the age of the volcanoes and their dimensions, geographic distribution or alignment, in contrast to hotspots such as the Hawaiian–Emperor and Cook-Austral seamount chains', ' This phenomenon is also seen in Martian volcanoes, particularly Elysium Mons', ' Early volcanic activity created trap basalt formations that extend tens of kilometers and stack up to  thick', ' Basanite and andesite are also found in the volcanic layer', ' More recently in geologic time, volcanic activity has deposited dacite, rhyolite and ignimbrite, as well as trachyte and trachyandesite', ' This trend towards the production of more felsic, viscous lavas could be a sign of a waning mantle plume', '  Geomorphology  [[File:Tibesti', 'gif|thumb|left|alt=Animation showing the phases of volcanic activity in the Tibesti Mountains|Animation showing the phases of volcanic activity in the Tibesti Mountains]]  Volcanic activity in the Tibesti took place in several phases', ' In the first phase, uplift and extension of the Precambrian basement occurred in the central area', ' The first structure to be formed was probably Tarso Abeki, followed by Tarso Tamertiou, Tarso Tieroko, Tarso Yega, Tarso Toon and Ehi Yéy', ' The product of this early volcanic activity has been completely obscured by later eruptions', ' In the second phase, the volcanic activity moved north and east, forming Tarso Ourari and the ignimbrite bases of the vast tarsos, as well as Emi Koussi to the southeast', ' Thereafter, during the third phase, the outpouring of lava and ejecta deposits increased from Tarso Yega, Tarso Toon, Tarso Tieroko and Ehi Yéy; the collapse of these structures formed the first calderas', ' This phase also saw the formation of the Bounaï lava dome and Tarso Voon', ' To the east, the lava flows formed the large plateaus of Tarso Emi Chi, Tarso Ahon and Tarso Mohi', ' Emi Koussi increased in height', ' The fourth phase saw the formation of Tarso Toussidé and the lava flows of Tarso Tôh in the west, the collapse of the caldera on the summit of Tarso Voon and associated ejecta deposits in the center, and the decline in lava production in the east, with the exception of Emi Koussi, which continued to rise', ' In the fifth phase, volcanic activity became much more localized and lava production continued to wane', ' Calderas formed on top of Tarso Toussidé and Emi Koussi, and the lava domes Ehi Sosso and Ehi Mousgou appeared', ' Finally, in the sixth phase, Pic Toussidé formed on the western rim of several pre-Trou au Natron calderas, along with new lava flows, including Timi on the northern slope of Tarso Toussidé', ' With scarce time for erosion, these lava flows have a dark, youthful appearance', '  [[File:Pic Toussidé ASTER', 'jpg|thumb|alt=Satellite image of the darker, more recent lava rock|Satellite image of the

former dissecting the earlier Toussidé calderas', ' Lava flows, minor pyroclastic deposits, and the appearance of small cinder cones, and the formation of the Era Kohor crater are the most recent volcanic activities on Emi Koussi', '  there are reports of volcanic activity in various parts of the massif, including hot springs at the Soborom geothermal field and fumaroles on Tarso Voon, Yi Yerra near Emi Koussi and Pic Toussidé', ' Carbonate deposits in the Trou au Natron and Era Kohor craters are also representative of more recent volcanic activity', '  The study of fluvial terraces has revealed coarse sand and gravel alternating with terraces of silt, clay and fine sand', ' This alternation highlights repeated changes in the dominant fluvial or wind patterns in the valleys of Tibesti during the Quaternary Period', ' The phases of erosion and sendimentation are indicative of the climate alternating between dry and wet conditions, the latter of which fostered vegetation in the Tibesti that was likely significantly denser than that which exists today', ' Furthermore, the discovery of calcified charophyta (particularly of the family Characeae) and gastropod fossils in Trou au Natron indicates the presence of a lake at least  deep during the Late Pleistocene', ' These phenomena are associated with various changes in climate, most notably during the last glacial maximum, which increased precipitation and reduced evaporation due to lower temperatures', ' In fact, the Tibesti supplied a considerable amount of water to the Paleolake Chad until the 5th millennium BC', '  Climate The Tibesti climate is substantially less dry than that of the surrounding Sahara Desert, but rainfall events are highly variable from year to year', ' In the south of the range, this variation is largely due to oscillations of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which steadily moves northward toward northern Chad from November until August, accompanied by humid monsoonal air', ' Normally, the ITCZ repels the Harmattan, a dry trade wind that blows west or southwest from the Sahara Desert, and brings rainfall to southern Tibesti', ' However, sometimes the front retires early, before reaching the Tibesti, leaving its southern portion dry', ' In the arid northern Tibesti, where the monsoon has little influence, storms are caused by episodic Sahara-Sudanese weather systems', ' For example, between 1957 and 1968, Bardaï, on the northern flank of the range, saw an average of  of precipitation annually, yet some years were completely dry while others saw  of rainfall', ' In general, the range receives less than  of rainfall per year', ' However, precipitation increases with altitude; for example  Trou au Natron  receives  annually', ' When the rainfall

average monthly minimum is ', ' Lows of  are not uncommon', ' Bardaï, located  above sea level, experiences average temperatures ranging between  in January, between  in April, and between  in August', ' The combination of high temperatures and low humidity results in potentially high evaporation rates, ranging from  in January to  in May, parching many enneris before they can exit the mountain range', '  Flora and fauna Like an island surrounded by ocean, the ecology of the Tibesti Mountains is distinguishable from that of the surrounding desert', ' As such, the mountains lie within their own biome, the  Tibesti-Jebel Uweinat montane xeric woodlands ecoregion, along with the Jebel Uweinat, a disjunct mountain range that also rises from the Sahara  to the east', ' Much of the ecoregion remains unexplored due to its remoteness and persistent political instability, yet it is known to contain a number of endemic and endangered species', ' Indeed, the isolation of the

these clans were the Cerdegua, Zouia, Kossseda (nicknamed yobat or ""hunters of well water""), and possibly the Ederguia, although the Ederguia\'s origin may be Zaghawa and only go back to the 17th century', ' These clans controlled the palm groves, and made a peace pact with the Tomagra, a nearby clan of camel herders who practiced Ghazw', ' It was upon the agreement to this pact at the end of the 16th century that power was consolidated under the Derdé, the principal regulator of the clans, whose appointment is always made from the Tomagra clan', '  There is evidence of early Daza settlements in the Tibesti; however, these early clans—the Goga, Kida, Terbouna and Obokina—were assimilated into later Daza clans, who arrived in the Tibesti between the 15th and 18th centuries, possibly having fled the Kanem-Bornu Empire in the southwest', ' These later Daza arrivals include the Arna Souinga in the south, Gouboda in the center-west, Tchioda and Dirsina in the west, Torama in the northwest and center-east, and the Derdekichia (literally, ""descendants of the chief,"" the products of a union between an Arna Souinga and an Emmeouia) in the north', ' The Tibesti then played the role of an impregnable mountain stronghold for the newcomers', ' Meanwhile, constant migration between the north and southwest of Chad, along with significant mixing of the populations, forged a significant degree of cohesion among the Toubou ethnicities', ' Periods of territorial expansion in the 10th and 13th centuries and periods of recession in the 15th and 16th centuries likely coincided with more or less pronounced wet and dry periods', '  Several clans with traditions similar to those of the Donzas of the Borkou region, south of the Tibesti, settled in the range in the 16th and 17th centuries', ' These include the Keressa and Odobaya in the west, Foctoa in the northwest and northeast, and Emmeouia in the north', ' Several other clans—the Mogode in the west, Terintere in the north, Tozoba in the center, and Tegua and Mada in the south—are originally clans of the Bideyat people who immigrated from the Ennedi Plateau, southeast of Tibesti, around the same time', ' The Mada, however, have since largely emigrated to Borkou, Kaouar and Kanem', '  The early 17th century also saw the arrival of three clans from the region of Kufra to the northeast', ' The Taïzera settled in the plateau in the center and west of the mass, probably fleeing the Arab push into present-day Libya', ' According to oral tradition, their leader was initially rejected by the Daza clans and lived in isolation until winning the favor of a Dirsina woman', ' The Mahadena occupy the northeast quarter of the range and are likely from the Jalo oasis of Cyrenaica and thus related to the Mogharba Arab tribes, although an alternative hypothesis is that they are of Bideyat origin', ' Following years of conflict, a branch of the Mahadena clan, the Fortena, withdrew to the western margin of the Tibesti', ' The Fortena Mado (""Red Fortena"") settled there, while the Fortena Yasko (""Black Fortena"") pushed further west to Kaouar', '  The Tuareg people intermixed with the Toubou clans, especially with the early Goga clan, which produced the Gouboda, and with the later Arna clan, which produced the Mormorea', ' In both instances, the new clans were placed under the authority of

Empire began a campaign of territorial conquest across northern Africa from its regional headquarters in Libya, yet  was unable to subdue the Tibesti', ' In 1890, to the chagrin of the Turks, France and Great Britain signed a declaration recognizing a French zone of influence in northern Africa from the Mediterranean Sea down to Lake Chad', ' In response, the Toubou allied with the Senussi Arabs of Libya and agreed that the southern half of the Tibesti could serve as a fallback base for the Senussi in their struggle against the French Colonial Army', "" As the Sennussis' influence moved southward, so did their headquarters, which in 1899 was moved to the town of Gouro on the southeast flank of the range"", ' The Senussi founded a Zawiya in Bardaï, which quickly promoted the total Islamization of the Tibesti', ' At the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War, the Senussi allied with the Ottoman Empire and, at the request of the Derdé, the Turks established garrisons in Tibesti beginning in March 1911', ' These garrisons fell apart a few months later when the Toubou attacked the Turkish troops', '  While the Italians occupied the Fezzan, a French column entered the Tibesti

Senussi revolt forced the Italians to temporarily withdraw from the Fezzan and the northeastern part of the Tibesti', ' Likewise, fierce resistance from the Toubou forced the French troops to retreat southward from the Tibesti in 1916', ' After a period of internal disorder, the Tibesti was reconquered by the French colonial empire in 1929, and the region was placed under the administration of French Equatorial Africa', ' Libya gained its independence from Italy in 1947, and was released from British and French oversight in 1951', '  Modern history  Chadian Civil War  Chad gained

French troops from the region, rebellion erupted in Bardaï, followed by numerous small battles over subsequent months and a more significant battle in Bardaï in September', ' In response, the Tombalbaye government imposed travel and trade restrictions on the Toubou and voided the traditional power of the then Derdé, Oueddei Kichidemi', ' Kichidemi went into exile in Libya the following year and became a national symbol in Chad for opposition to the government', ' These events sparked the First Chadian Civil War, which lasted from 1965 to 1979', '  In 1968, the French Army, at the

international pressure, Libya withdrew from southern Chad in late 1981, and Habré's Armed Forces of the North (FAN) took control of the entirety of Chad with the exception of the Tibesti, where Goukouni retreated with his Libyan-backed Government of National Unity (GUNT) forces"", ' Goukouni then established a National Peace Government in Bardaï and proclaimed it the legitimate government of Chad', ' Habré attacked the GUNT in the Tibesti in both December 1982 and January 1983 but was repelled on both occasions', ' Although fighting intensified over the next several months, the mountains remained under the control of the GUNT and Libyan forces', '  By 1986, following a series of military defeats, the GUNT had begun to disintegrate along with relations between Goukouni and Libya', ' In December, Goukouni was arrested by the Libyans, which spurred his troops to attack Libyan positions in the Tibesti, forcing the Libyans to withdraw', ' Libya sought to retake Bardaï and Zouar, and sent a task-force of 2,000 troops with T-62 tanks and heavy support by the Libyan Air Force into the Tibesti', ' The offensive started successfully, expelling the GUNT from its key strongholds', ' The attack ultimately backfired, however, as it resulted in the prompt reaction of Habré, who sent 2,000 soldiers to support the GUNT forces', ' Although the Libyans were only partially repelled from the Tibesti, the broader campaign was a great strategic victory, as it transformed a civil war into a national war against a foreign invader, stimulating a sense of national unity never before seen in

violent between 1998 and 2002, resulting in the deaths of between 500 and 850 MDJT rebels and a comparable number of ANT soldiers at locales across northern Chad, including Bardaï', ' Although civilian casualties were relatively limited, many civilians were killed and injured by landmines, and the war resulted in the displacement of a large portion of the local population', '  Between 1998 and 2010 the MDJT had established a weak government in the Tibesti region, functionally independent from that of Chad', ' In 2002, however, weakened by its isolation in the Tibesti and from a series of military defeats, the MDJT split into several factions following the death of its leader, Youssouf Togoïmi', ' In 2005, under pressure from Libya, the ""most legitimate"" MDJT faction signed a peace agreement with the Chadian government, yet the war continued, albeit at a lower intensity', ' From 2009 to 2010, the last of the MDJT rebels surrendered to the Chadian government', ' The legacy of decades of war continues to burden the Tibesti with a lack of government, a warrior culture, and a landscape strewn with thousands of landmines', '  Gold rush Gold was discovered in the Tibesti
