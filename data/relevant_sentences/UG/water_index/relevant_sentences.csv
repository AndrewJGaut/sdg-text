Conversely, genetic studies indicate that some morphologically distinctive populations, traditionally regarded as separate species, may only be variants of single species', ' Two of the snail genera, Biomphalaria and  Bulinus,  are intermediate hosts of the parasite bilharzia (schistosomiasis)', ' Human infections by this parasite are common at Lake Victoria', ' This may increase as a result of the spread of the invasive water hyacinth (an optimum snail habitat), and the loss of many snail-eating cichlids in the lake', '  Spiders Evarcha culicivora is a species of jumping spider (family Salticidae) found only around Lake Victoria in Kenya and Uganda', ' It feeds primarily on female mosquitos', ""  Fisheries thumb|Fishers and their boats on the shore of Lake Victoria  Lake Victoria supports Africa's largest inland fishery (as of 1997)"", ' Initially the fishery involved native species, especially tilapia and haplochromine cichlids, but also catfish (Bagrus, Clarias, Synodontis and silver butter catfish), elephantfish, ningu (Labeo victorianus) and marbled lungfish (Protopterus aethiopicus)', 'Lake Victoria Fisheries Organization (2016)', '  Some of these, including tilapia and ningu (Labeo victorianus), had already declined in the first half of the 20th century due to overfishing', ' To boost fishing, several species of non-native tilapia and Nile perch were introduced to the lake in the 1950s', ' Nevertheless, the natives continued to dominate fisheries until the 1970s where their decline meant that there was a strong shift towards the non-native Nile tilapia (now 7 percent of catches), non-native Nile perch (60 percent) and the native Lake Victoria sardine (30 percent)', ' Because of its small size, the abundant open-water Lake Victoria sardine only supported minor fisheries until the decline of other natives', ' At the peak in the early 1990s,  of Nile perch were landed annually in Lake Victoria, but this has declined significantly in later years', '  Environmental issues A number of environmental issues are associated with Lake Victoria and the complete disappearance of many endemic cichlid species has been called the ""most dramatic example of human-caused extinctions within an ecosystem""', '  Invasive fish Starting in the 1950s,many species have been introduced to Lake Victoria where they have become invasive and a prime reason for the extinction of many endemic haplochromine cichlids', ' Among the introductions are several tilapias: redbreast (Coptodon rendalli), redbelly (C', ' zillii),  Nile (Oreochromis niloticus) and blue-spotted tilapias (O', ' leucostictus)', 'Pringle, R', 'M', ' (2005)', ' The Origins of the Nile Perch in Lake Victoria', ' BioScience 55 (9): 780-787', ' Although these have contributed to the extinction of native fish by causing significant changes to the ecosystem, outcompeted natives and (in the case of the Nile tilapia) possibly hybridized with the highly threatened native tilapias, the most infamous introduction was the large and highly predatory Nile perch (Lates niloticus)', '  [[File:Lates niloticus 2', 'jpg|thumb|upright|The Nile perch was introduced to Lake Victoria for fishing, and can reach up to  and ', ']] As early as the 1920s, it was proposed to introduce a large pelagic predator such as the Nile perch to improve the fisheries in the lake', ' At the same time it was warned that this could present a serious danger to the native fish species and required extensive research into possible ecological effects before done', ' These warnings primarily concerned the native tilapia O', ' esculentus, as the smaller haplochromine cichlids (despite playing an important role in local fisheries) were regarded as ""trash fish"" by the colonial government', ' In the following decades, the pressure to introduce the Nile perch continued, as did warnings about the possible effects of doing it', ' The first introduction of Nile perch to the region, done by the Uganda Game and Fisheries Department (then part of the colonial government) and local African fish guards, happened upstream of Murchison Falls directly after the completion of the Owen Falls Dam in 1954', ' This allowed it to spread to Lake Kyoga where additional Nile perch were released in 1955, but not Victoria itself', ' Scientists argued that further introduction should wait until research showed the effect of the introduction in Kyoga, but by the late 1950s, Nile perch began being caught in Lake Victoria', ' As the species was already present, there were few objections when more Nile perch were transferred to Victoria to further bolster the stock in 1962–63', ' The origin of the first Victoria introductions in the 1950s is not entirely clear and indisputable evidence is lacking', ' Uganda Game and Fisheries Department (UGFD) officials denied that they were involved, but circumstantial evidence suggests otherwise and local Africans employed by UGFD have said that they introduced the species in 1954–55 under the directive of senior officials', ' UGFD officials argued that Nile perch must have spread to Lake Victoria by themselves by passing through the Owen Falls Dam when shut down for maintenance, but this is considered highly unlikely by many scientists', ' The Nile perch had spread throughout the lake by 1970', ' Initially the population of the Nile perch was relatively low, but a drastic increase happened, peaking in the 1980s, followed by a decline starting in the 1990s', ""  Due to the presence of the Nile perch, the natural balance of the lake's ecosystem has been disrupted"", ' The food chain is being altered and in some cases, broken by the indiscriminate eating habits of the Nile perch', ' The subsequent decrease in the number of algae-eating fish allows the algae to grow at an alarming rate, thereby choking the lake', ' The increasing amounts of algae, in turn, increase the amount of detritus (dead plant material) that falls to the deeper portions of the lake before decomposing', ' As a by-product of this the oxygen levels in the deeper layer of water are being depleted', ' Without oxygen, any aerobic life (such as fish) cannot exist in the deeper parts of the lake, forcing all life to exist within a narrow range of depth', ' In this way, the Nile perch has degraded the diverse and thriving ecosystem that was once Lake Victoria', ' The abundance of aquatic life is not the only dependent of the lake: more than thirty million people in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda rely on the lake for its natural resources', '  Hundreds of endemic species that evolved under the special conditions offered by the protection of Lake Victoria have been lost due to extinction, and several more are still threatened', ' Their loss is devastating for the lake, the fields of ecology, genetics and evolution biology, and more evidently, for the local fisheries', ' Local fisheries once depended on catching the lungfish, tilapia, carp and catfish that comprise the local diet', ' Today, the composition and yields of such fish catches are virtually negligible', ' Extensive fish kills, Nile perch, loss of habitat and overfishing have caused many fisheries to collapse and many protein sources to be unavailable at the market for local consumption', ' Few fisheries, though, have been able to make the switch to catching the Nile perch, since that requires a significant amount of capital resources', '  Water hyacinth invasion  [[File:NdereIsland3', 'jpg|right|thumb|A hyacinth-choked lakeshore at Ndere Island, Lake Victoria, Kenya', ']]  The

decays considerably faster, however, so the fertility of the lake is dependent on the rate at which these nutrients can be taken up by fish and other organisms', ' There is little doubt that Haplochromis played an important role in returning detritus and plankton back into solution', ' With some 80 percent of Haplochromis species feeding off detritus, and equally capable of feeding off one another, they represented a tight, internal recycling system, moving nutrients and biomass both vertically and horizontally through the water column, and even out of the lake via predation by

and ningu (Labeo victorianus), had already declined in the first half of the 20th century due to overfishing', ' To boost fishing, several species of non-native tilapia and Nile perch were introduced to the lake in the 1950s', ' Nevertheless, the natives continued to dominate fisheries until the 1970s where their decline meant that there was a strong shift towards the non-native Nile tilapia (now 7 percent of catches), non-native Nile perch (60 percent) and the native Lake Victoria sardine (30 percent)', ' Because of its small size, the abundant open-water Lake Victoria sardine only supported minor fisheries until the decline of other natives', ' At the peak in the early 1990s,  of Nile perch were landed annually in Lake Victoria, but this has declined significantly in later years', '  Environmental issues A number of environmental issues are associated with Lake Victoria and the complete disappearance of many endemic cichlid species has been called the ""most dramatic example of human-caused extinctions within an ecosystem""', '  Invasive fish Starting in the 1950s,many species have been introduced to Lake Victoria where they have become invasive and a prime reason for the extinction of many endemic haplochromine cichlids', ' Among the introductions are several tilapias: redbreast (Coptodon rendalli), redbelly (C', ' zillii),  Nile (Oreochromis niloticus) and blue-spotted tilapias (O', ' leucostictus)', 'Pringle, R', 'M', ' (2005)', ' The Origins of the Nile Perch in Lake Victoria', ' BioScience 55 (9): 780-787', ' Although these have contributed to the extinction of native fish by causing significant changes to the ecosystem, outcompeted natives and (in the case of the Nile tilapia) possibly hybridized with the highly threatened native tilapias, the most infamous introduction was the large and highly predatory Nile perch (Lates niloticus)', '  [[File:Lates niloticus 2', 'jpg|thumb|upright|The Nile perch was introduced to Lake Victoria for

it was warned that this could present a serious danger to the native fish species and required extensive research into possible ecological effects before done', ' These warnings primarily concerned the native tilapia O', ' esculentus, as the smaller haplochromine cichlids (despite playing an important role in local fisheries) were regarded as ""trash fish"" by the colonial government', ' In the following decades, the pressure to introduce the Nile perch continued, as did warnings about the possible effects of doing it', ' The first introduction of Nile perch to the region, done by the Uganda Game and Fisheries Department (then part of the colonial government) and local African fish guards, happened upstream of Murchison Falls directly after the completion of the Owen Falls Dam in 1954', ' This allowed it to spread to Lake Kyoga where additional Nile perch were released in 1955, but not Victoria itself', ' Scientists argued that further introduction should wait until research showed the effect of the introduction in Kyoga, but by the late 1950s, Nile perch began being caught in Lake Victoria', ' As the species was already present, there were few objections when more Nile perch were transferred to Victoria to further bolster the stock in 1962–63', ' The origin of the first Victoria introductions in the 1950s is not entirely clear and indisputable evidence is lacking', ' Uganda Game and Fisheries Department (UGFD) officials denied that they were involved, but circumstantial evidence suggests otherwise and local Africans employed by UGFD have said that they introduced the species in 1954–55 under the directive of senior officials', ' UGFD officials argued that Nile perch must have spread to Lake Victoria by themselves by passing through the Owen Falls Dam when shut down for maintenance, but this is considered highly unlikely by many scientists', ' The Nile perch had spread throughout the lake by 1970', ' Initially the population of the Nile perch was relatively low, but a drastic increase happened, peaking in the 1980s, followed by a decline starting in the 1990s', ""  Due to the presence of the Nile perch, the natural balance of the lake's ecosystem has been disrupted"", ' The food chain is being altered and in some cases, broken by the indiscriminate eating habits of the Nile perch', ' The subsequent decrease in the number of algae-eating fish allows the algae to grow at an alarming rate, thereby choking the lake', ' The increasing amounts of algae, in turn, increase the amount of detritus (dead plant material) that falls to the deeper portions of the lake before decomposing', ' As a by-product of this the oxygen levels in the deeper layer of water are being depleted', ' Without oxygen, any aerobic life (such as fish) cannot exist in the deeper parts of the lake, forcing all life to exist within a narrow range of depth', ' In this way, the Nile perch has degraded the diverse and thriving ecosystem that was once Lake Victoria', ' The abundance of aquatic life is not the only dependent of the lake: more than thirty million people in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda rely on the lake for its natural resources', '  Hundreds of endemic species that evolved under the special conditions offered by the protection of Lake Victoria have been lost due to extinction, and several more are still threatened', ' Their loss is devastating for the lake, the fields of ecology, genetics and evolution biology, and more evidently, for the local fisheries', ' Local fisheries once depended on catching the lungfish, tilapia, carp and catfish that comprise the local diet', ' Today, the composition and yields of such fish catches are virtually negligible', ' Extensive fish kills, Nile perch, loss of habitat and overfishing have caused many fisheries to collapse and many protein sources to be unavailable at the market for local consumption', ' Few fisheries, though, have been able to make the switch to catching the Nile perch, since that

decays considerably faster, however, so the fertility of the lake is dependent on the rate at which these nutrients can be taken up by fish and other organisms', ' There is little doubt that Haplochromis played an important role in returning detritus and plankton back into solution', ' With some 80 percent of Haplochromis species feeding off detritus, and equally capable of feeding off one another, they represented a tight, internal recycling system, moving nutrients and biomass both vertically and horizontally through the water column, and even out of the lake via predation by humans and terrestrial animals', ' The removal of Haplochromis, however, may have contributed to the increasing frequency of algal blooms, which may in turn be responsible for mass fish kills', '

to the lake in the 1950s', ' Nevertheless, the natives continued to dominate fisheries until the 1970s where their decline meant that there was a strong shift towards the non-native Nile tilapia (now 7 percent of catches), non-native Nile perch (60 percent) and the native Lake Victoria sardine (30 percent)', ' Because of its small size, the abundant open-water Lake Victoria sardine only supported minor fisheries until the decline of other natives', ' At the peak in the early 1990s,  of Nile perch were landed annually in Lake Victoria, but this has declined significantly in later years', '  Environmental issues A number of environmental issues are associated with Lake Victoria and the complete disappearance of many endemic cichlid species has been called the ""most dramatic example of

blue-spotted tilapias (O', ' leucostictus)', 'Pringle, R', 'M', ' (2005)', ' The Origins of the Nile Perch in Lake Victoria', ' BioScience 55 (9): 780-787', ' Although these have contributed to the extinction of native fish by causing significant changes to the ecosystem, outcompeted natives and (in the case of the Nile tilapia) possibly hybridized with the highly threatened native tilapias, the most infamous introduction was the large and highly predatory Nile perch (Lates niloticus)', '  [[File:Lates niloticus 2', 'jpg|thumb|upright|The Nile perch was introduced to Lake Victoria for

it was warned that this could present a serious danger to the native fish species and required extensive research into possible ecological effects before done', ' These warnings primarily concerned the native tilapia O', ' esculentus, as the smaller haplochromine cichlids (despite playing an important role in local fisheries) were regarded as ""trash fish"" by the colonial government', ' In the following decades, the pressure to introduce the Nile perch continued, as did warnings about the possible effects of doing it', ' The first introduction of Nile perch to the region, done by the Uganda Game and Fisheries Department (then part of the colonial government) and local African fish guards, happened upstream of Murchison Falls directly after the completion of the Owen Falls Dam in 1954', ' This allowed it to spread to Lake Kyoga where additional Nile perch were released in 1955, but not Victoria itself', ' Scientists argued that further introduction should wait until research showed the effect of the introduction in Kyoga, but by the late 1950s, Nile perch began being caught in Lake Victoria', ' As the species was already present, there were few objections when more Nile perch were transferred to Victoria to further bolster the stock in 1962–63', ' The origin of the first Victoria introductions in the 1950s is not entirely clear and indisputable evidence is lacking', ' Uganda Game and Fisheries Department (UGFD) officials denied that they were involved, but circumstantial evidence suggests otherwise and local Africans employed by UGFD have said that they introduced the species in 1954–55 under the directive of senior officials', ' UGFD officials argued that Nile perch must have spread to Lake Victoria by themselves by passing through the Owen Falls Dam when shut down for maintenance, but this is considered highly unlikely by many scientists', ' The Nile perch had spread throughout the lake by 1970', ' Initially the population of the Nile perch was relatively low, but a drastic increase happened, peaking in the 1980s, followed by a decline starting in the 1990s', ""  Due to the presence of the Nile perch, the natural balance of the lake's ecosystem has been disrupted"", ' The food chain is being altered and in some cases, broken by the indiscriminate eating habits of the Nile perch', ' The subsequent decrease in the number of algae-eating fish allows the algae to grow at an alarming rate, thereby choking the lake', ' The increasing amounts of algae, in turn, increase the amount of detritus (dead plant material) that falls to the deeper portions of the lake before decomposing', ' As a by-product of this the oxygen levels in the deeper layer of water are being depleted', ' Without oxygen, any aerobic life (such as fish) cannot exist in the deeper parts of the lake, forcing all life to exist within a narrow range of depth', ' In this way, the Nile perch has degraded the diverse and thriving ecosystem that was once Lake Victoria', ' The abundance of aquatic life is not the only dependent of the lake: more than thirty million people in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda rely on the lake for its natural resources', '  Hundreds of endemic species that evolved under the special conditions offered by the protection of Lake Victoria have been lost due to extinction, and several more are still threatened', ' Their loss is devastating for the lake, the fields of ecology, genetics and evolution biology, and more evidently, for the local fisheries', ' Local fisheries once depended on catching the lungfish, tilapia, carp and catfish that comprise the local diet', ' Today, the composition and yields of such fish catches are virtually negligible', ' Extensive fish kills, Nile perch, loss of habitat and overfishing have caused many fisheries to collapse and many protein sources to be unavailable at the market for local consumption', ' Few fisheries, though, have been able to make the switch to catching the Nile perch, since that

sewage into the river, increasing its eutrophication that in turn is helping to increase the invasive water hyacinth', ' Increased logging and act of deforestation has led to environmental degradation around the region reducing the absorption of polluting chemicals and deteriorating the water quality', '   Environmental data  As of 2016, an environmental data repository exists for Lake Victoria', ' The repository contains shoreline, bathymetry, pollution, temperature, wind vector, and other important data for both the lake and the wider Basin', '   History and exploration  thumb|Bismarck Rock The first recorded information about Lake Victoria comes from Arab traders plying the inland routes in search of gold, ivory, other precious commodities, and slaves', '  left|thumb|The lake as it is visible from the shores of the Speke Resort in Kampala, Uganda  The lake existed and was known to many Africans in the catchment area long before it was sighted by a European in 1858 when the British explorer John Hanning Speke reached its southern shore while on his journey with Richard Francis Burton to explore central Africa and locate the Great Lakes', ' Believing he had found the source of the Nile on seeing this ""vast expanse of open water"" for the first time, Speke named the lake after Queen Victoria', ' Burton, who had been recovering from illness at the time and resting further south on the shores of Lake Tanganyika, was outraged that Speke claimed to have proved his discovery to have been the true source of the Nile River, which Burton regarded as still unsettled', "" A very public quarrel ensued, which not only sparked a great deal of intense debate within the scientific community of the day, but also much interest by other explorers keen to either confirm or refute Speke's discovery"", ""  In the late 1860s, the famous Scottish explorer and missionary David Livingstone failed in his attempt to verify Speke's discovery, instead pushing too far west and entering the River Congo system instead"", "" Ultimately, the Welsh-American explorer Henry Morton Stanley, on an expedition funded by the New York Herald newspaper, confirmed the truth of Speke's discovery, circumnavigating the lake and reporting the great outflow at Ripon Falls on the lake's northern shore"", '  Nalubaale Dam  [[File:From top of Nalubaale Power Station', 'jpg|thumb|right|The Nalubaale

across a natural rock weir', ' In 1952, engineers acting for the government of Colonial Uganda blasted out the weir and reservoir to replace it with an artificial barrage to control the level of the lake and reduce the gradual erosion of the rock weir', ' A standard for mimicking the old rate of outflow called the ""agreed curve"" was established, setting the maximum flow rate at 300 to 1,700 cubic metres per second (392–2,224 cu\xa0yd/sec) depending on the lake\'s water level', '  In 2002, Uganda completed a second hydroelectric complex in the area, the Kiira Hydroelectric Power Station, with World Bank assistance', "" By 2006, the water levels in Lake Victoria had reached an 80-year low, and Daniel Kull, an independent hydrologist living in Nairobi, Kenya, calculated that Uganda was releasing about twice as much water as is allowed under the agreement, and was primarily responsible for recent drops in the lake's level"", '   Water use  Many towns and cities are reliant on Victoria for their water supplies, for farming and other uses', '   Lamadi water scheme  The Lamadi water scheme is a water and sanitation project that serves Mwanza and the satellite towns of Lamadi, Misungwi, Magu, Bukoba, and Musoma on the bank of Lake Victoria', ' \xa0European Investment Bank started the project in 2013 with the aim of protecting the environmental health of the lake, through improved water and sanitation to the towns whose pollution is part of the degradation of the lake', ' The project aims to provide safe drinking water for an estimated one million people and improved sanitation for 100 000 people', ' Sediment and suspended solids are filtered out using sand, which acts like a sieve', ' The water is then ready to be chlorinated or treated in another way', ' The sand filtration helps reduce water-borne diseases and is based on the use of the local environment', '  Transport  Since the 1900s, Lake Victoria ferries have been an important means of transport between Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya', ' The main ports on the lake are Kisumu, Mwanza, Bukoba, Entebbe, Port Bell, and Jinja', ' Until 1963, the fastest and newest ferry, MV Victoria, was designated a
