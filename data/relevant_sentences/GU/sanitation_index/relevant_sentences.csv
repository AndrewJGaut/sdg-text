Retrieved 16 February 2017, from  At the base of the dam, through a low level valve, water is released during the dry period.

Indeed, an accumulation of water during the exceptionally heavy rain, through some temporary obstruction in one of the deep worn gullies which indent the beautiful slope of that great mountain, and a subsequent landslip would probably account for the damage done without the aid of either an eruption of water from the crater or the supernatural appearances which are duly noted by the old chroniclers.The volcano was last blanketed by snowfall in January 1967."

The resulting reservoir not only covered the rapids of this area of the Grijalva River, but also fresh water and thermal springs, rainforest, animal habitat, farmland, archeological sites and various towns and villages, with the most significant being Quechula. However, each year during the dry season, at least part of this structure reappears when water levels are low. Precipitation in the area is also strongly affected by the weather phenomena of El Niño and La Niña which can significantly raise or lower reservoir levels and the amount of water which flows out of them through the dams. These two dams serve as a means to control flooding of the river as it heads into Tabasco state, but when reservoirs are dangerously full, it becomes necessary to release large quantities of water. This water heads to the flat slow draining floodplains of Tabasco, including its capital of Villahermosa and has cause serious flooding problems. In 2008, Twenty two communities in the dam area were flooded and when the water finally flowed freely again, major flooding occurred in Tabasco, especially in Nacajuca .
