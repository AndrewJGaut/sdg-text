GU-2015-7#-00000680,2.0,"A short-lived boom in the mahogany trade occurred around 1900 in response to growing demand for the wood in the United States, but the ruthless exploitation of the forests without any conservation or reforestation depleted resources. When the government almost doubled the land tax, the large landowners refused to pay. As a result, workers and their families suffered from malnutrition and were continually in debt to their employers. The conditions, aggravated by rising unemployment and the disastrous hurricane, were responsible for severe hardship among the poor. High voter-eligibility standards for property and income limited the electorate to the wealthiest 2 percent of the population. The devaluation of the British Honduras dollar in 1949 effectively reduced the property and income voter-eligibility standards. The devaluation enraged labour because it protected the interests of the big transnationals, such as the Belize Estate and Produce Company, whose trade in British pounds would have suffered without devaluation while it subjected British Honduras's working class, already experiencing widespread unemployment and poverty, to higher prices for goods—especially food—imported from the United States. Exports of mahogany continued as an economic mainstay, as commercial agriculture remained unprofitable due to unfavourable colonial tax policies and trade restrictions."

Belize is considered a tax haven.http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/02/belize-offshore-secrecy-ill-at-ease-with-uk-politics-and-us-authorities  Etymology The earliest known record of the name ""Belize"" appears in the journal of the Dominican priest Fray José Delgado, dating to 1677. Early colonial period (1506–1862)  Spanish conquistadors explored the land and declared it part of the Spanish Empire, but they failed to settle the territory because of its lack of resources and the hostile tribes of the Yucatán. Since 1854, the richest inhabitants elected an Assembly of notables by censal vote, which was replaced by a Legislative Council appointed by the British monarchy.https://www.clio.fr/CHRONOLOGIE/pdf/pdf_chronologie_lamerique_centrale.pdf  As a colony, Belize began to attract British investors. The effects of widespread unemployment were worsened by a devastating hurricane that struck the colony in 1931. Perceptions of the government's relief effort as inadequate were aggravated by its refusal to legalize labour unions or introduce a minimum wage. Britain's decision to devalue the British Honduras dollar in 1949 worsened economic conditions and led to the creation of the People's Committee, which demanded independence. In 2005, Belize was the site of unrest caused by discontent with the PUP government, including tax increases in the national budget. Belize has a rich variety of wildlife because of its unique position between North and South America and a wide range of climates and habitats for plant and animal life. As a part of the globally significant Mesoamerican Biological Corridor that stretches from southern Mexico to Panama, Belize's biodiversity – both marine and terrestrial – is rich, with abundant flora and fauna. [[File:Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary 07.JPG|thumb|Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary]] Belize is also a leader in protecting biodiversity and natural resources. Natural resources and energy Belize is known to have a number of economically important minerals, but none in quantities large enough to warrant mining. In 1990 limestone, used in road construction, was the only mineral resource exploited for domestic or export use. The government of Belize faces important challenges to economic stability. Rapid action to improve tax collection has been promised, but a lack of progress in reining in spending could bring the exchange rate under pressure. Infrastructure remains a major economic development challenge; Belize has the region's most expensive electricity. This entices drug traffickers and money launderers who want to utilize the banking system. Because of this, many drug traffickers and money launderers utilize banks in Belize. As a result, the United States Department of State has recently named Belize one of the world's ""major money laundering countries"".2016 World Fact Book of the United States Central Intelligence Agency. Fortis took over the management of BEL in 1999, at the invitation of the government of Belize in an attempt to mitigate prior financial problems with the locally managed utility. The utility encountered serious financial problems after the country's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) in 2008 ""disallowed the recovery of previously incurred fuel and purchased power costs in customer rates and set customer rates at a level that does not allow BEL to earn a fair and reasonable return"", Fortis said in a June 2011 statement. These measures include adding more patrols to ""hot spots"" in the city, obtaining more resources to deal with the predicament, creating the ""Do the Right Thing for Youths at Risk"" program, creating the Crime Information Hotline, creating the Yabra Citizen Development Committee, an organization that helps youth, and many other initiatives. Social structure   Belize's social structure is marked by enduring differences in the distribution of wealth, power, and prestige. Because of the small size of Belize's population and the intimate scale of social relations, the social distance between the rich and the poor, while significant, is nowhere as vast as in other Caribbean and Central American societies, such as Jamaica and El Salvador. Political and economic power remain vested in the hands of the local elite. The tournament is broadcast over local radio stations, and prize money is awarded to the winners."

Farming The subsistence environment at Aguateca, like at other Classic Maya sites, was limited by shallow, sloped soils and unpredictable weather patterns until their collapse.

When the government almost doubled the land tax, the large landowners refused to pay. As a result, workers and their families suffered from malnutrition and were continually in debt to their employers. The conditions, aggravated by rising unemployment and the disastrous hurricane, were responsible for severe hardship among the poor. High voter-eligibility standards for property and income limited the electorate to the wealthiest 2 percent of the population. The devaluation of the British Honduras dollar in 1949 effectively reduced the property and income voter-eligibility standards. The devaluation enraged labour because it protected the interests of the big transnationals, such as the Belize Estate and Produce Company, whose trade in British pounds would have suffered without devaluation while it subjected British Honduras's working class, already experiencing widespread unemployment and poverty, to higher prices for goods—especially food—imported from the United States.

Belize is considered a tax haven.http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/02/belize-offshore-secrecy-ill-at-ease-with-uk-politics-and-us-authorities  Etymology The earliest known record of the name ""Belize"" appears in the journal of the Dominican priest Fray José Delgado, dating to 1677. Early colonial period (1506–1862)  Spanish conquistadors explored the land and declared it part of the Spanish Empire, but they failed to settle the territory because of its lack of resources and the hostile tribes of the Yucatán. Since 1854, the richest inhabitants elected an Assembly of notables by censal vote, which was replaced by a Legislative Council appointed by the British monarchy.https://www.clio.fr/CHRONOLOGIE/pdf/pdf_chronologie_lamerique_centrale.pdf  As a colony, Belize began to attract British investors. The effects of widespread unemployment were worsened by a devastating hurricane that struck the colony in 1931. Perceptions of the government's relief effort as inadequate were aggravated by its refusal to legalize labour unions or introduce a minimum wage. Britain's decision to devalue the British Honduras dollar in 1949 worsened economic conditions and led to the creation of the People's Committee, which demanded independence. In 2005, Belize was the site of unrest caused by discontent with the PUP government, including tax increases in the national budget. Belize has a rich variety of wildlife because of its unique position between North and South America and a wide range of climates and habitats for plant and animal life. As a part of the globally significant Mesoamerican Biological Corridor that stretches from southern Mexico to Panama, Belize's biodiversity – both marine and terrestrial – is rich, with abundant flora and fauna. [[File:Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary 07.JPG|thumb|Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary]] Belize is also a leader in protecting biodiversity and natural resources. Natural resources and energy Belize is known to have a number of economically important minerals, but none in quantities large enough to warrant mining. In 1990 limestone, used in road construction, was the only mineral resource exploited for domestic or export use. The government of Belize faces important challenges to economic stability. Rapid action to improve tax collection has been promised, but a lack of progress in reining in spending could bring the exchange rate under pressure. Infrastructure remains a major economic development challenge; Belize has the region's most expensive electricity. This entices drug traffickers and money launderers who want to utilize the banking system. Because of this, many drug traffickers and money launderers utilize banks in Belize. As a result, the United States Department of State has recently named Belize one of the world's ""major money laundering countries"".2016 World Fact Book of the United States Central Intelligence Agency. Fortis took over the management of BEL in 1999, at the invitation of the government of Belize in an attempt to mitigate prior financial problems with the locally managed utility. The utility encountered serious financial problems after the country's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) in 2008 ""disallowed the recovery of previously incurred fuel and purchased power costs in customer rates and set customer rates at a level that does not allow BEL to earn a fair and reasonable return"", Fortis said in a June 2011 statement. These measures include adding more patrols to ""hot spots"" in the city, obtaining more resources to deal with the predicament, creating the ""Do the Right Thing for Youths at Risk"" program, creating the Crime Information Hotline, creating the Yabra Citizen Development Committee, an organization that helps youth, and many other initiatives. Social structure   Belize's social structure is marked by enduring differences in the distribution of wealth, power, and prestige. Because of the small size of Belize's population and the intimate scale of social relations, the social distance between the rich and the poor, while significant, is nowhere as vast as in other Caribbean and Central American societies, such as Jamaica and El Salvador.

Belize is considered a tax haven.http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/02/belize-offshore-secrecy-ill-at-ease-with-uk-politics-and-us-authorities  Etymology The earliest known record of the name ""Belize"" appears in the journal of the Dominican priest Fray José Delgado, dating to 1677. Early colonial period (1506–1862)  Spanish conquistadors explored the land and declared it part of the Spanish Empire, but they failed to settle the territory because of its lack of resources and the hostile tribes of the Yucatán. Since 1854, the richest inhabitants elected an Assembly of notables by censal vote, which was replaced by a Legislative Council appointed by the British monarchy.https://www.clio.fr/CHRONOLOGIE/pdf/pdf_chronologie_lamerique_centrale.pdf  As a colony, Belize began to attract British investors. The effects of widespread unemployment were worsened by a devastating hurricane that struck the colony in 1931. Perceptions of the government's relief effort as inadequate were aggravated by its refusal to legalize labour unions or introduce a minimum wage. Britain's decision to devalue the British Honduras dollar in 1949 worsened economic conditions and led to the creation of the People's Committee, which demanded independence. In 2005, Belize was the site of unrest caused by discontent with the PUP government, including tax increases in the national budget. Belize has a rich variety of wildlife because of its unique position between North and South America and a wide range of climates and habitats for plant and animal life. As a part of the globally significant Mesoamerican Biological Corridor that stretches from southern Mexico to Panama, Belize's biodiversity – both marine and terrestrial – is rich, with abundant flora and fauna. [[File:Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary 07.JPG|thumb|Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary]] Belize is also a leader in protecting biodiversity and natural resources. Natural resources and energy Belize is known to have a number of economically important minerals, but none in quantities large enough to warrant mining. In 1990 limestone, used in road construction, was the only mineral resource exploited for domestic or export use. The government of Belize faces important challenges to economic stability. Rapid action to improve tax collection has been promised, but a lack of progress in reining in spending could bring the exchange rate under pressure. Infrastructure remains a major economic development challenge; Belize has the region's most expensive electricity. This entices drug traffickers and money launderers who want to utilize the banking system. Because of this, many drug traffickers and money launderers utilize banks in Belize. As a result, the United States Department of State has recently named Belize one of the world's ""major money laundering countries"".2016 World Fact Book of the United States Central Intelligence Agency. Fortis took over the management of BEL in 1999, at the invitation of the government of Belize in an attempt to mitigate prior financial problems with the locally managed utility. The utility encountered serious financial problems after the country's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) in 2008 ""disallowed the recovery of previously incurred fuel and purchased power costs in customer rates and set customer rates at a level that does not allow BEL to earn a fair and reasonable return"", Fortis said in a June 2011 statement. These measures include adding more patrols to ""hot spots"" in the city, obtaining more resources to deal with the predicament, creating the ""Do the Right Thing for Youths at Risk"" program, creating the Crime Information Hotline, creating the Yabra Citizen Development Committee, an organization that helps youth, and many other initiatives. Social structure   Belize's social structure is marked by enduring differences in the distribution of wealth, power, and prestige. Because of the small size of Belize's population and the intimate scale of social relations, the social distance between the rich and the poor, while significant, is nowhere as vast as in other Caribbean and Central American societies, such as Jamaica and El Salvador. Political and economic power remain vested in the hands of the local elite. The tournament is broadcast over local radio stations, and prize money is awarded to the winners."
