Belahcen Fitzgerald stated that the prize money would be used to help women start their own catering micro businesses. Participants are selected through partnerships with other non-profits or by the center's social worker, based on the criteria that they are economically disadvantaged and are motivated to train to achieve financial independence. After graduating from the training center, they are provided support to find relevant employment. As of June 2015 80% of Amal graduates have found employment in a relevant field. Center staff help participants find employment with outside businesses upon graduation. About 45% of the training center's revenue comes from restaurant sales, 5% from private donations, and the remaining 50% from the Drosos Foundation.
