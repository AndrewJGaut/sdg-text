Kambonde of Ondonga, who allocated the land to the missionaries to construct the hospital on, deliberately chose the site as it was a sacred for traditional healers', ' It was felt that it would be wise for all health practitioners to be in the same vicinity', '  In October 1908 the Finnish Evangelic Lutheran Mission sent Dr Selma Rainio with two female missionaries to Ondonga – Ovamboland in

enclosed with clay walls to act as in-patient wards, there were nurses accommodation, a kitchen, a workshop and other hospital facilities', ' On 4 October 1958 a fire broke out, legend has it that a crow picked up a piece of porridge which boiled over and perched on one of the thatched roofs to consume the porridge, unfortunately the porridge contained some live ember, causing the thatch roof to catch fire (Ntuleni and Shiweda 2011, p', '\xa043)', ' Within an hour, approximately 40 buildings had burnt down, engulfing many of the medical equipment and diesel generator', '  Miraculously no

disbanded in 1928 over the aforementioned exodus of Angolan Afrikaners', ' Those members of the Aranos church who did not come from Angola came northward from the Union of South Africa', ' The first services were held June 20, 1930, in Kemel farm', ' On June 21, a service was held at Kema farm, beginning the Gibeon Reformed Church', ' Services were held on the Omrah farm until June 20, 1959, when
