interested in ensuring that the small but influential Ivorian elite was sufficiently satisfied with the status quo to refrain from developing anti-French sentiments and calls for independence', ' Although strongly opposed to the practices of association, educated Ivorians believed that they would achieve equality in the French colonial system through assimilation rather than through complete

by Félix Houphouët-Boigny, who ruled the country until 1993', ' Relatively stable by regional standards, Ivory Coast established close political and economic ties with its West African neighbours

predominant', '   Etymology  Originally, Portuguese and French merchant-explorers in the 15th and 16th centuries divided the west coast of Africa, very roughly, into four ""coasts"" reflecting resources available from each coast', ' The coast that the French named the Côte d\'Ivoire and the Portuguese named the Costa Do Marfim — both, literally, mean ""Coast of Ivory"" — lay between what

ivory', '  Other names included the Côte de Dents, literally ""Coast of Teeth"", again reflecting the trade in ivory; the Côte de Quaqua, after the people whom the Dutch named the Quaqua (alternatively Kwa Kwa); the Coast of the Five and Six Stripes, after a type of cotton fabric also traded there; and the Côte du Vent, the Windward Coast, after perennial local off-shore weather
