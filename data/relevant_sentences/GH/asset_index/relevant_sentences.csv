up after the establishment of the Korle Bu Hospital in 1919 at the time, Sir Frederick Gordon Guggisberg', ' The idea was abandoned after Guggisberg left office', ' There was renewed interest in this venture in 1951', ' At the behest of the Gold Coast colonial administration and the University College of the Gold Coast, a technical team from the University of London visited the Gold Coast to assess the scheme and specifications for staffing and facilities that would be required fully operationalise a medical school', ' In 1952, a government-approved commission recommended the postponement of the establishment of medical school indefinitely', ' In 1955, the issue was revisited and the colonial government invited the University College of the Gold Coast and the Kumasi College of Technology to examine the options to start a medical school', ' It was decided medical courses would be introduced in a step-by-step fashion, as originally espoused by the University of London delegation in 1951', "" In 1956, the University Council Committee under the leadership of the institution's first principal, David Balme, was formed to suggest other avenues for founding the school"",

upgrade of the Korle Bu Hospital to a teaching hospital with its autonomous management board', ' By 1960, the year Ghana became a republic, there was still no pathway for implementation as Korle Bu was not equipped for clinical training and funds were unavailable for its expansion', ' The Nkrumah government sought technical and financial assistance from the Kennedy administration', ' The US

the medical school would function', ' The government accepted these recommendations', ' In 1962, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) recommended that the National Medical and Health Training Centre should have these subsidiaries: a medical school, a school of nursing; a dental school; a school of medical technology; a post graduate school; a research facilities centre', '  It was planned that the medical school would be financially independent with its own council', ' However, the University of Ghana would be its parent institution and would award its medical degrees', ' The suggested curriculum would be American-based even though the Ghanaian education was modelled on the British university system', ' To streamline these differences, admitted sixth formers were to go through a two-year pre-medical science course prior to the actual medical training', ' In October 1962, the foundation class of 51 premedical students were admitted to the University of Ghana', ' Within a year of the programme, the American Dean informed the government that he was unable to find lecturers in the basic sciences', "" In February 1964, Ghana's first president decided to wholly rely on domestic sources of funding and manpower to establish the full medical school"", ' A study tour by Alexander Kwapong, Charles Odamtten Easmon and E', ' A', ' Badoe at then newly established

Ankobra, Ebokro, Axim and ""Encasser,"" in which they declared to have been allies since time immemorial, and to always have put their disputes in front of the commandant of Fort Saint Anthony at

over by the Dutch—by directly accessing the sources of the gold trade in the interior', ' In 1623, the Portuguese founded a fortified outpost on the Ankobra River, some 20 kilometres from Axim, near the present-day village of Bamianko, from which they established a gold mine on Aboasi Hill, some eight kilometres from this outpost', ' After the Dutch conquered Axim, they took over the Portuguese attempt to control the gold trade in the interior', ' However, the fort that they built for this purpose on the Ankobra River, Fort Ruychaver, was blown up by its commandant only five years after its construction, after a conflict with local people', '  After the Dutch West India Company lost its monopoly on the slave trade in 1730, it tried to develop cotton plantations at Axim', '  The commandant of Fort Saint Anthony continued to have some legal jurisdiction over the mentioned indigenous states well into the 19th century', ' When in the late 1850s the Dutch reformed their possessions on the Gold Coast into districts and instructed their fort commandants—now referred to as ""residents""—to make reports of the peoples under its jurisdiction, the resident of Fort Saint

credited with the imamship', '  The extension of trade with the Dyula, and later with the Hausa, linked the Dagbon state with neighbouring kingdoms, like the Fezzan, Egypt, and the Bight of Benin', ' By 1788, Yendi was said to be bigger than Kumasi and Salaga', '  It was culturally closer to, and was the result of, other Sahelian kingdoms, especially to the Mossi Kingdoms, Mali Empire, Songhai

over by the Dutch—by directly accessing the sources of the gold trade in the interior', ' In 1623, the Portuguese founded a fortified outpost on the Ankobra River, some 20 kilometres from Axim, near the present-day village of Bamianko, from which they established a gold mine on Aboasi Hill, some eight kilometres from this outpost', ' After the Dutch conquered Axim, they took over the Portuguese attempt to control the gold trade in the interior', ' However, the fort that they built for this purpose on the Ankobra River, Fort Ruychaver, was blown up by its commandant only five years after its construction, after a conflict with local people', '  After the Dutch West India Company lost its monopoly on the slave trade in 1730, it tried to develop cotton plantations at Axim', '  The commandant of Fort Saint Anthony continued to have some legal jurisdiction over the mentioned indigenous states well into the 19th century', ' When in the late 1850s the Dutch reformed their possessions on the Gold Coast into districts and instructed their fort commandants—now referred to as ""residents""—to make reports of the peoples under its jurisdiction, the resident of Fort Saint
