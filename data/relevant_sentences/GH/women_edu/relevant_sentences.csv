The suggested curriculum would be American-based even though the Ghanaian education was modelled on the British university system. By the end of 1968, the Ghana medical school had become a semi-autonomous school under the University of Ghana with functions identical to other faculties of the university. ” Learning environment Curriculum The school curriculum has gone through periodic reviews in line with national health needs and contemporary trends in medical education. A new curriculum was introduced in 2009 and two classes were simultaneously admitted: secondary school students and bachelor's degree holders in the natural sciences for the Graduate Entry Medical Programme (GEMP). In its early days, the school reserved 5% of spots to foreign students from African countries without medical schools. In the 2010/11 academic year, the medical school had an incoming class of 150, and rising, at least a quarter of which are women. Institutional challenges In the 1980s, due to an economic downturn from the structural adjustment programme in Ghana, the school faced an exodus of its faculty to institutions abroad which led to a reduction in the student intake. The Medical School has two programs: the undergraduate MBChB program for students from the Secondary School, and the Graduate Entry Medical Program for Graduate students with a Bachelor of Science degree.
