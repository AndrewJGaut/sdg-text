Additionally, the river current was especially strong before the Dnieper was dammed in the 20th century. Within months after the Polish troops blew up the original chain bridge, that very summer 1920 the Ukrainian engineer Evgeny Paton proposed the reconstruction project that would have reused the old chains to be lifted from under water.

MB-2005-5#-00000237,1.0,"A major goal of overhead power line design is to maintain adequate clearance between energized conductors and the ground so as to prevent dangerous contact with the line, and to provide reliable support for the conductors, resilience to storms, ice loads, earthquakes and other potential damage causes.Donald G. Fink and H. Wayne Beaty, Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers, Eleventh Edition, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1978, , Chapter 14 Overhead Power Transmission Today overhead lines are routinely operated at voltages exceeding 765,000 volts between conductors. The weight of the conductor must be supported, as well as dynamic loads due to wind and ice accumulation, and effects of vibration. A large transmission line project may have several types of towers, with ""tangent"" (""suspension"" or ""line"" towers, UK) towers intended for most positions and more heavily constructed towers used for turning the line through an angle, dead-ending (terminating) a line, or for important river or road crossings. [[Image:Einebenenleitung.jpg|thumb|Low-profile power lines near an airfield]] Power lines and supporting structures can be a form of visual pollution. The number of disks is chosen based on line voltage, lightning withstand  requirement, altitude, and environmental factors such as fog, pollution, or salt spray. Strain insulators must be strong enough mechanically to support the full weight of the span of conductor, as well as loads due to ice accumulation, and wind.Advanced Rubber Products - Suspension Insulators  Porcelain insulators may have a semi-conductive glaze finish, so that a small current (a few milliamperes) passes through the insulator. Better pollution and wet performance is leading to the increased use of such insulators. The sag of the conductor (vertical distance between the highest and lowest point of the curve) varies depending on the temperature and additional load such as ice cover. The ice and wind loading of bundled conductors will be greater than a single conductor of the same total cross section, and bundled conductors are more difficult to install than single conductors. Overhead lines and structures may shed ice, creating a hazard. Glover, M. Sarma, and T.

MB-2005-5#-00000237,1.0,"A major goal of overhead power line design is to maintain adequate clearance between energized conductors and the ground so as to prevent dangerous contact with the line, and to provide reliable support for the conductors, resilience to storms, ice loads, earthquakes and other potential damage causes.Donald G. Fink and H. Wayne Beaty, Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers, Eleventh Edition, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1978, , Chapter 14 Overhead Power Transmission Today overhead lines are routinely operated at voltages exceeding 765,000 volts between conductors. The weight of the conductor must be supported, as well as dynamic loads due to wind and ice accumulation, and effects of vibration. A large transmission line project may have several types of towers, with ""tangent"" (""suspension"" or ""line"" towers, UK) towers intended for most positions and more heavily constructed towers used for turning the line through an angle, dead-ending (terminating) a line, or for important river or road crossings. [[Image:Einebenenleitung.jpg|thumb|Low-profile power lines near an airfield]] Power lines and supporting structures can be a form of visual pollution. The number of disks is chosen based on line voltage, lightning withstand  requirement, altitude, and environmental factors such as fog, pollution, or salt spray. Strain insulators must be strong enough mechanically to support the full weight of the span of conductor, as well as loads due to ice accumulation, and wind.Advanced Rubber Products - Suspension Insulators  Porcelain insulators may have a semi-conductive glaze finish, so that a small current (a few milliamperes) passes through the insulator. Better pollution and wet performance is leading to the increased use of such insulators. The sag of the conductor (vertical distance between the highest and lowest point of the curve) varies depending on the temperature and additional load such as ice cover. The ice and wind loading of bundled conductors will be greater than a single conductor of the same total cross section, and bundled conductors are more difficult to install than single conductors. Overhead lines and structures may shed ice, creating a hazard. Glover, M. Sarma, and T.

MB-2005-5#-00000237,1.0,"A major goal of overhead power line design is to maintain adequate clearance between energized conductors and the ground so as to prevent dangerous contact with the line, and to provide reliable support for the conductors, resilience to storms, ice loads, earthquakes and other potential damage causes.Donald G. Fink and H. Wayne Beaty, Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers, Eleventh Edition, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1978, , Chapter 14 Overhead Power Transmission Today overhead lines are routinely operated at voltages exceeding 765,000 volts between conductors. The weight of the conductor must be supported, as well as dynamic loads due to wind and ice accumulation, and effects of vibration. A large transmission line project may have several types of towers, with ""tangent"" (""suspension"" or ""line"" towers, UK) towers intended for most positions and more heavily constructed towers used for turning the line through an angle, dead-ending (terminating) a line, or for important river or road crossings. [[Image:Einebenenleitung.jpg|thumb|Low-profile power lines near an airfield]] Power lines and supporting structures can be a form of visual pollution. The number of disks is chosen based on line voltage, lightning withstand  requirement, altitude, and environmental factors such as fog, pollution, or salt spray. Strain insulators must be strong enough mechanically to support the full weight of the span of conductor, as well as loads due to ice accumulation, and wind.Advanced Rubber Products - Suspension Insulators  Porcelain insulators may have a semi-conductive glaze finish, so that a small current (a few milliamperes) passes through the insulator. Better pollution and wet performance is leading to the increased use of such insulators. The sag of the conductor (vertical distance between the highest and lowest point of the curve) varies depending on the temperature and additional load such as ice cover. The ice and wind loading of bundled conductors will be greater than a single conductor of the same total cross section, and bundled conductors are more difficult to install than single conductors. Overhead lines and structures may shed ice, creating a hazard. Glover, M. Sarma, and T.

MB-2005-5#-00000237,1.0,"A major goal of overhead power line design is to maintain adequate clearance between energized conductors and the ground so as to prevent dangerous contact with the line, and to provide reliable support for the conductors, resilience to storms, ice loads, earthquakes and other potential damage causes.Donald G. Fink and H. Wayne Beaty, Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers, Eleventh Edition, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1978, , Chapter 14 Overhead Power Transmission Today overhead lines are routinely operated at voltages exceeding 765,000 volts between conductors. The weight of the conductor must be supported, as well as dynamic loads due to wind and ice accumulation, and effects of vibration. A large transmission line project may have several types of towers, with ""tangent"" (""suspension"" or ""line"" towers, UK) towers intended for most positions and more heavily constructed towers used for turning the line through an angle, dead-ending (terminating) a line, or for important river or road crossings. [[Image:Einebenenleitung.jpg|thumb|Low-profile power lines near an airfield]] Power lines and supporting structures can be a form of visual pollution. The number of disks is chosen based on line voltage, lightning withstand  requirement, altitude, and environmental factors such as fog, pollution, or salt spray. Strain insulators must be strong enough mechanically to support the full weight of the span of conductor, as well as loads due to ice accumulation, and wind.Advanced Rubber Products - Suspension Insulators  Porcelain insulators may have a semi-conductive glaze finish, so that a small current (a few milliamperes) passes through the insulator. Better pollution and wet performance is leading to the increased use of such insulators. The sag of the conductor (vertical distance between the highest and lowest point of the curve) varies depending on the temperature and additional load such as ice cover. The ice and wind loading of bundled conductors will be greater than a single conductor of the same total cross section, and bundled conductors are more difficult to install than single conductors. Overhead lines and structures may shed ice, creating a hazard. Glover, M. Sarma, and T.
