Tai Dam are well known producers of fine quality silk and cotton textiles and many women export directly to markets in Japan and the US. Older Tai Dam women still wear the traditional blue indigo cotton shirt, skirt, and a black turban woven with colored patterns. The easiest way to differentiate these groups is by looking at the women's dress. Hmong women are renowned for their embroidery and weaving. Many geometrical patterns exist and they are passed on from mother to daughter. Embroidery and applique is a social activity, a time for women to sit together and exchange views and news. It is one of the main occasions used for finding a wife or a husband. The young men and women toss the makkono, a small fabric ball as part of a courting ritual.
