primarily in the direction of the volcano of San Salvador', ' The increased demand for housing was due to an increase in the numbers of middle class workers, members of the military, and professionals', '  Around 2000, the city expansion westward slowed', ' There was an expansion of middle-class neighborhoods such as Merliot, Santa Elena and the Tier, but internal migration and the cessation of armed conflict created a high demand for urban public housing', ' This gave rise to large urban development projects mostly in the east and north, to the phenomenon of ""bedroom

introduced Roman Catholicism and the now predominant Spanish language, along with numerous customs that have blended with the indigenous culture', ' Honduras became independent in 1821 and has since been a republic, although it has consistently endured much social strife and political instability, and remains one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere', ' In 1960, the northern part of what was the Mosquito Coast was transferred from Nicaragua to Honduras by the International Court of Justice', ""  The nation's economy is primarily agricultural, making it especially vulnerable to

serves the international market', '  Etymology The literal meaning of the term ""Honduras"" is ""depths"" in Spanish', ' The name could either refer to the bay of Trujillo as an anchorage, fondura in the Leonese dialect of Spain, or to Columbus\'s alleged quote that ""Gracias a Dios que hemos salido de esas honduras"" (""Thank God we have departed from those depths"")', 'Davidson traces it to Herrera', '   It was not until the end of the 16th century that Honduras was used for the whole province', ' Prior to 1580, Honduras referred to only the eastern part of the province, and Higueras

Isthmo-Colombian area), and the intervening area was one of gradual transition', ' However, these concepts had no meaning in the Pre-Columbian era itself and represent extremely diverse areas', ' The Lenca people of the interior highlands are also generally considered to be culturally Mesoamerican, though the extent of linkage with other areas varied over time (for example, expanding during the zenith of the Toltec Empire)', '  In the extreme west, Maya civilization flourished for hundreds of years', "" The dominant, best known, and best studied state within Honduras's borders was in Copán, which was located in a mainly non-Maya area, or on the frontier between Maya and non-Maya areas"", ' Copán declined with other Lowland centres during the conflagrations of the Terminal Classic in the 9th century', "" The Maya of this civilization survive in western Honduras as the Ch'orti', isolated from their Choltian linguistic peers to the west"", '  However, Copán represents only a fraction of Honduran pre-Columbian history', ' Remnants of other civilizations are found throughout the country', ' Archaeologists have studied sites such as  and La Sierra in the Naco Valley, Los Naranjos on

March 1524, Gil González Dávila became the first Spaniard to enter Honduras as a conquistador', ' followed by Hernán Cortés, who had brought forces down from Mexico', ' Much of the conquest took place in the following two decades, first by groups loyal to Cristóbal de Olid, and then by those loyal to Francisco de Montejo but most particularly by those following Alvarado', ' In addition to Spanish resources, the conquerors relied heavily on armed forces from Mexico—Tlaxcalans and Mexica armies of thousands who remained garrisoned in the region', '  Resistance to conquest was led in particular

slaves, mostly from Angola, were imported', ' After about 1650, very few slaves or other outside workers arrived in Honduras', '  Although the Spanish conquered the southern or Pacific portion of

adopted the name Republic of Honduras, the unionist ideal never waned, and Honduras was one of the Central American countries that pushed the hardest for a policy of regional unity', '  Policies favoring international trade and investment began in the 1870s, and soon foreign interests became involved, first in shipping from the north coast, especially tropical fruit and most notably bananas,

Admiral, O', 'Henry refers to the nation as a ""small maritime banana republic""; naturally, the fruit was the entire basis of its economy', ' According to a literary analyst writing for The

extraordinary influence over the politics of Honduras and its neighbors', '""Where did banana republics get their name?, The Economist In addition to drawing Central American workers north, the fruit

Herrera', '   It was not until the end of the 16th century that Honduras was used for the whole province', ' Prior to 1580, Honduras referred to only the eastern part of the province, and Higueras

Isthmo-Colombian area), and the intervening area was one of gradual transition', ' However, these concepts had no meaning in the Pre-Columbian era itself and represent extremely diverse areas', ' The Lenca people of the interior highlands are also generally considered to be culturally Mesoamerican, though the extent of linkage with other areas varied over time (for example, expanding during the zenith of the Toltec Empire)', '  In the extreme west, Maya civilization flourished for hundreds of years', "" The dominant, best known, and best studied state within Honduras's borders was in Copán, which was located in a mainly non-Maya area, or on the frontier between Maya and non-Maya areas"", ' Copán declined with other Lowland centres during the conflagrations of the Terminal Classic in the 9th century', "" The Maya of this civilization survive in western Honduras as the Ch'orti', isolated from their Choltian linguistic peers to the west"", '  However, Copán represents only a fraction of

Nicaragua in 1522', ' This theory holds that the name Nicaragua was formed from Nicarao and agua (Spanish for ""water""), to reference the fact that there are two large lakes and several other bodies of water within the country', ' However, as of 2002, it was determined that the cacique\'s real name was Macuilmiquiztli, which meant ""Five Deaths"" in the Nahuatl language, rather than Nicarao', '

introduced Roman Catholicism and the now predominant Spanish language, along with numerous customs that have blended with the indigenous culture', ' Honduras became independent in 1821 and has since been a republic, although it has consistently endured much social strife and political instability, and remains one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere', ' In 1960, the northern part of what was the Mosquito Coast was transferred from Nicaragua to Honduras by the International Court of Justice', ""  The nation's economy is primarily agricultural, making it especially vulnerable to

area's demographics and culture"", ' Honduras is known for its rich natural resources, including minerals, coffee, tropical fruit, and sugar cane, as well as for its growing textiles industry, which serves the international market', '  Etymology The literal meaning of the term ""Honduras"" is ""depths"" in Spanish', ' The name could either refer to the bay of Trujillo as an anchorage, fondura in the Leonese dialect of Spain, or to Columbus\'s alleged quote that ""Gracias a Dios que hemos salido de esas honduras"" (""Thank God we have departed from those depths"")', 'Davidson traces it to Herrera', '   It was not until the end of the 16th century that Honduras was used for the whole province', ' Prior to 1580, Honduras referred to only the eastern part of the province, and Higueras

regions: Mesoamerica in the west and the Isthmo-Colombian area in the east', ' Each complex had a ""core area"" within Honduras (the Sula Valley for Mesoamerica, and La Mosquitia for the Isthmo-Colombian area), and the intervening area was one of gradual transition', ' However, these concepts had no meaning in the Pre-Columbian era itself and represent extremely diverse areas', ' The Lenca people of the interior highlands are also generally considered to be culturally Mesoamerican, though the extent of linkage with other areas varied over time (for example, expanding during the zenith of the Toltec Empire)', '  In the extreme west, Maya civilization flourished for hundreds of years', "" The dominant, best known, and best studied state within Honduras's borders was in Copán, which was located in a mainly non-Maya area, or on the frontier between Maya and non-Maya areas"", ' Copán declined with other Lowland centres during the conflagrations of the Terminal Classic in the 9th century', "" The Maya of this civilization survive in western Honduras as the Ch'orti', isolated from their Choltian linguistic peers to the west"", '  However, Copán represents only a fraction of Honduran pre-Columbian history', ' Remnants of other civilizations are found throughout the country', ' Archaeologists have studied sites such as  and La Sierra in the Naco Valley, Los Naranjos on Lake Yojoa, Yarumela in the Comayagua Valley, La Ceiba and Salitron Viejo (both now under the Cajón Dam reservoir), Selin Farm and Cuyamel in the Aguan valley, Cerro Palenque, Travesia, Curruste,

cargo', "" Bartholomew's men stole the cargo they wanted and kidnapped the ship's elderly captain to serve as an interpreter in the first recorded encounter between the Spanish and the Maya"", '  In March 1524, Gil González Dávila became the first Spaniard to enter Honduras as a conquistador', ' followed by Hernán Cortés, who had brought forces down from Mexico', ' Much of the conquest took place in the following two decades, first by groups loyal to Cristóbal de Olid, and then by those loyal to Francisco de Montejo but most particularly by those following Alvarado', ' In addition to Spanish resources, the conquerors relied heavily on armed forces from Mexico—Tlaxcalans and Mexica armies of thousands who remained garrisoned in the region', '  Resistance to conquest was led in particular by Lempira', ' Many regions in the north of Honduras never fell to the Spanish, notably the Miskito Kingdom', "" After the Spanish conquest, Honduras became part of Spain's vast empire in the New

disease and resistance made this option less available, slaves from other parts of Central America were brought in', ' When local slave trading stopped at the end of the sixteenth century, African slaves, mostly from Angola, were imported', ' After about 1650, very few slaves or other outside workers arrived in Honduras', '  Although the Spanish conquered the southern or Pacific portion of Honduras fairly quickly, they were less successful on the northern, or Atlantic side', ' They managed to found a few towns along the coast, at Puerto Caballos and Trujillo in particular, but failed to conquer the eastern portion of the region and many pockets of independent indigenous people as well', ' The Miskito Kingdom in the northeast was particularly effective at resisting conquest', ' The

adopted the name Republic of Honduras, the unionist ideal never waned, and Honduras was one of the Central American countries that pushed the hardest for a policy of regional unity', '  Policies favoring international trade and investment began in the 1870s, and soon foreign interests became involved, first in shipping from the north coast, especially tropical fruit and most notably bananas,

Admiral, O', 'Henry refers to the nation as a ""small maritime banana republic""; naturally, the fruit was the entire basis of its economy', ' According to a literary analyst writing for The Economist, ""his phrase neatly conjures up the image of a tropical, agrarian country', ' But its real meaning is sharper: it refers to the fruit companies from the United States that came to exert extraordinary influence over the politics of Honduras and its neighbors', '""Where did banana republics get their name?, The Economist In addition to drawing Central American workers north, the fruit companies encouraged immigration of workers from the English-speaking Caribbean, notably Jamaica and Belize, which introduced an African-descended, English-speaking and largely Protestant population

serves the international market', '  Etymology The literal meaning of the term ""Honduras"" is ""depths"" in Spanish', ' The name could either refer to the bay of Trujillo as an anchorage, fondura in the Leonese dialect of Spain, or to Columbus\'s alleged quote that ""Gracias a Dios que hemos salido de esas honduras"" (""Thank God we have departed from those depths"")', 'Davidson traces it to Herrera', '   It was not until the end of the 16th century that Honduras was used for the whole province', ' Prior to 1580, Honduras referred to only the eastern part of the province, and Higueras

Isthmo-Colombian area), and the intervening area was one of gradual transition', ' However, these concepts had no meaning in the Pre-Columbian era itself and represent extremely diverse areas', ' The Lenca people of the interior highlands are also generally considered to be culturally Mesoamerican, though the extent of linkage with other areas varied over time (for example, expanding during the zenith of the Toltec Empire)', '  In the extreme west, Maya civilization flourished for hundreds of years', "" The dominant, best known, and best studied state within Honduras's borders was in Copán, which was located in a mainly non-Maya area, or on the frontier between Maya and non-Maya areas"", ' Copán declined with other Lowland centres during the conflagrations of the Terminal Classic in the 9th century', "" The Maya of this civilization survive in western Honduras as the Ch'orti', isolated from their Choltian linguistic peers to the west"", '  However, Copán represents only a fraction of

March 1524, Gil González Dávila became the first Spaniard to enter Honduras as a conquistador', ' followed by Hernán Cortés, who had brought forces down from Mexico', ' Much of the conquest took place in the following two decades, first by groups loyal to Cristóbal de Olid, and then by those loyal to Francisco de Montejo but most particularly by those following Alvarado', ' In addition to Spanish resources, the conquerors relied heavily on armed forces from Mexico—Tlaxcalans and Mexica armies of thousands who remained garrisoned in the region', '  Resistance to conquest was led in particular

slaves, mostly from Angola, were imported', ' After about 1650, very few slaves or other outside workers arrived in Honduras', '  Although the Spanish conquered the southern or Pacific portion of

adopted the name Republic of Honduras, the unionist ideal never waned, and Honduras was one of the Central American countries that pushed the hardest for a policy of regional unity', '  Policies favoring international trade and investment began in the 1870s, and soon foreign interests became involved, first in shipping from the north coast, especially tropical fruit and most notably bananas,

Admiral, O', 'Henry refers to the nation as a ""small maritime banana republic""; naturally, the fruit was the entire basis of its economy', ' According to a literary analyst writing for The Economist, ""his phrase neatly conjures up the image of a tropical, agrarian country', ' But its real meaning is sharper: it refers to the fruit companies from the United States that came to exert extraordinary influence over the politics of Honduras and its neighbors', '""Where did banana republics get their name?, The Economist In addition to drawing Central American workers north, the fruit

northern and southern parts of the city, while the 1970s saw growth continue further south, north and west', ' The housing developments of Colonia Miravalle, Montebello, Satellite, Maquilishuat, San Mateo Lomas de San Francisco, Alta Mira, Loma Linda, La Floresta, and Jardines de la Libertad were built during this period', '  The expansion of San Salvador, while occurring in all directions, was primarily in the direction of the volcano of San Salvador', ' The increased demand for housing was due to an increase in the numbers of middle class workers, members of the military, and professionals', '  Around 2000, the city expansion westward slowed', ' There was an expansion of middle-class neighborhoods such as Merliot, Santa Elena and the Tier, but internal migration and the cessation of armed conflict created a high demand for urban public housing', ' This gave rise to large urban development projects mostly in the east and north, to the phenomenon of ""bedroom communities"", and to a disorderly growth pattern', ""  Architecture San Salvador's colonial structures, especially its colonial cathedrals, have been destroyed over time by historic earthquakes, consequently Modernist and Gothic style cathedrals have taken their place"", ' During the Salvadoran civil war, large building construction projects were halted and eventually cancelled due to the
