Several 6th Dynasty royal seals and stone blocks – the latter of which were found within the funerary temple of Queen Ankhesenpepi II, the known mother of Pepi II – were discovered in the 1999–2000 excavation season at Saqqara, which demonstrate that she also married Merenre after Pepi I's death and became this king's chief wife.A. Labrousse and J. Leclant, ""Les reines Ânkhesenpépy II et III (fin de l'Ancien Empire): campagnes 1999 et 2000 de la MAFS"", Compte-rendu de l'Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres/, (CRAIBL) 2001, pp.367–384 Pepi II would, therefore, be Pepi I's grandson while Merenre was, most likely, Pepi II's father since he is known to have married Pepi II's known mother, Queen Ankhesenpepi II.

An alabaster statuette in the Brooklyn Museum depicts a young Pepi II, in full kingly regalia, sitting on the lap of his mother. A glimpse of the personality of the pharaoh while he was still a child can be found in a letter he wrote to Harkhuf, a governor of Aswan and the head of one of the expeditions he sent into Nubia. Over his long life Pepi II had several wives, including:  Neith – She was the mother of Pepi's successor Merenre Nemtyemsaf II.Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan. Ankhesenpepi III She was the daughter of Merenre Nemtyemsaf I and hence a granddaughter of Pepi I.  Ankhesenpepi IV – The mother of King Neferkare according to texts in her tomb. Other scenes include the sed festival, a festival of the god Min and scenes showing Pepi executing a Libyan chieftain, who is accompanied by his wife and son. He is shown at a much smaller scale than his mother. The difference in size may refer to the time period when his mother served as a regent. The king is shown as a naked child. 2004. p 288,  It is then believed that he was in turn succeeded by the obscure pharaoh Neitiqerty Siptah, though according to popular tradition (as recorded by Manetho two millennia later) he was succeeded by Queen Nitocris, who would be the first female ruler of Egypt.Shaw, Ian.

An alabaster statuette in the Brooklyn Museum depicts a young Pepi II, in full kingly regalia, sitting on the lap of his mother. A glimpse of the personality of the pharaoh while he was still a child can be found in a letter he wrote to Harkhuf, a governor of Aswan and the head of one of the expeditions he sent into Nubia. Over his long life Pepi II had several wives, including:  Neith – She was the mother of Pepi's successor Merenre Nemtyemsaf II.Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan. Ankhesenpepi III She was the daughter of Merenre Nemtyemsaf I and hence a granddaughter of Pepi I.  Ankhesenpepi IV – The mother of King Neferkare according to texts in her tomb. Other scenes include the sed festival, a festival of the god Min and scenes showing Pepi executing a Libyan chieftain, who is accompanied by his wife and son. He is shown at a much smaller scale than his mother. The difference in size may refer to the time period when his mother served as a regent. The king is shown as a naked child. 2004. p 288,  It is then believed that he was in turn succeeded by the obscure pharaoh Neitiqerty Siptah, though according to popular tradition (as recorded by Manetho two millennia later) he was succeeded by Queen Nitocris, who would be the first female ruler of Egypt.Shaw, Ian.

Several 6th Dynasty royal seals and stone blocks – the latter of which were found within the funerary temple of Queen Ankhesenpepi II, the known mother of Pepi II – were discovered in the 1999–2000 excavation season at Saqqara, which demonstrate that she also married Merenre after Pepi I's death and became this king's chief wife.A. Labrousse and J. Leclant, ""Les reines Ânkhesenpépy II et III (fin de l'Ancien Empire): campagnes 1999 et 2000 de la MAFS"", Compte-rendu de l'Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres/, (CRAIBL) 2001, pp.367–384 Pepi II would, therefore, be Pepi I's grandson while Merenre was, most likely, Pepi II's father since he is known to have married Pepi II's known mother, Queen Ankhesenpepi II. Neues Museum, Berlin His mother Ankhesenpepi II (Ankhesenmeryre II) most likely ruled as regent in the early years of his reign. An alabaster statuette in the Brooklyn Museum depicts a young Pepi II, in full kingly regalia, sitting on the lap of his mother. A glimpse of the personality of the pharaoh while he was still a child can be found in a letter he wrote to Harkhuf, a governor of Aswan and the head of one of the expeditions he sent into Nubia. Over his long life Pepi II had several wives, including:  Neith – She was the mother of Pepi's successor Merenre Nemtyemsaf II.Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan. Ankhesenpepi III She was the daughter of Merenre Nemtyemsaf I and hence a granddaughter of Pepi I.  Ankhesenpepi IV – The mother of King Neferkare according to texts in her tomb. Other scenes include the sed festival, a festival of the god Min and scenes showing Pepi executing a Libyan chieftain, who is accompanied by his wife and son. He is shown at a much smaller scale than his mother. The difference in size may refer to the time period when his mother served as a regent. The king is shown as a naked child. 2004. p 288,  It is then believed that he was in turn succeeded by the obscure pharaoh Neitiqerty Siptah, though according to popular tradition (as recorded by Manetho two millennia later) he was succeeded by Queen Nitocris, who would be the first female ruler of Egypt.Shaw, Ian.

Several 6th Dynasty royal seals and stone blocks – the latter of which were found within the funerary temple of Queen Ankhesenpepi II, the known mother of Pepi II – were discovered in the 1999–2000 excavation season at Saqqara, which demonstrate that she also married Merenre after Pepi I's death and became this king's chief wife.A.

An alabaster statuette in the Brooklyn Museum depicts a young Pepi II, in full kingly regalia, sitting on the lap of his mother. A glimpse of the personality of the pharaoh while he was still a child can be found in a letter he wrote to Harkhuf, a governor of Aswan and the head of one of the expeditions he sent into Nubia. Over his long life Pepi II had several wives, including:  Neith – She was the mother of Pepi's successor Merenre Nemtyemsaf II.Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan. Ankhesenpepi III She was the daughter of Merenre Nemtyemsaf I and hence a granddaughter of Pepi I.  Ankhesenpepi IV – The mother of King Neferkare according to texts in her tomb. Other scenes include the sed festival, a festival of the god Min and scenes showing Pepi executing a Libyan chieftain, who is accompanied by his wife and son. He is shown at a much smaller scale than his mother. The difference in size may refer to the time period when his mother served as a regent. The king is shown as a naked child. 2004. p 288,  It is then believed that he was in turn succeeded by the obscure pharaoh Neitiqerty Siptah, though according to popular tradition (as recorded by Manetho two millennia later) he was succeeded by Queen Nitocris, who would be the first female ruler of Egypt.Shaw, Ian.

A glimpse of the personality of the pharaoh while he was still a child can be found in a letter he wrote to Harkhuf, a governor of Aswan and the head of one of the expeditions he sent into Nubia. Over his long life Pepi II had several wives, including:  Neith – She was the mother of Pepi's successor Merenre Nemtyemsaf II.Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan. Ankhesenpepi III She was the daughter of Merenre Nemtyemsaf I and hence a granddaughter of Pepi I.  Ankhesenpepi IV – The mother of King Neferkare according to texts in her tomb. Other scenes include the sed festival, a festival of the god Min and scenes showing Pepi executing a Libyan chieftain, who is accompanied by his wife and son. He is shown at a much smaller scale than his mother. The difference in size may refer to the time period when his mother served as a regent.

An alabaster statuette in the Brooklyn Museum depicts a young Pepi II, in full kingly regalia, sitting on the lap of his mother. A glimpse of the personality of the pharaoh while he was still a child can be found in a letter he wrote to Harkhuf, a governor of Aswan and the head of one of the expeditions he sent into Nubia. Over his long life Pepi II had several wives, including:  Neith – She was the mother of Pepi's successor Merenre Nemtyemsaf II.Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan. Ankhesenpepi III She was the daughter of Merenre Nemtyemsaf I and hence a granddaughter of Pepi I.  Ankhesenpepi IV – The mother of King Neferkare according to texts in her tomb. Other scenes include the sed festival, a festival of the god Min and scenes showing Pepi executing a Libyan chieftain, who is accompanied by his wife and son. He is shown at a much smaller scale than his mother. The difference in size may refer to the time period when his mother served as a regent.

A glimpse of the personality of the pharaoh while he was still a child can be found in a letter he wrote to Harkhuf, a governor of Aswan and the head of one of the expeditions he sent into Nubia. Over his long life Pepi II had several wives, including:  Neith – She was the mother of Pepi's successor Merenre Nemtyemsaf II.Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan. Ankhesenpepi III She was the daughter of Merenre Nemtyemsaf I and hence a granddaughter of Pepi I.  Ankhesenpepi IV – The mother of King Neferkare according to texts in her tomb. Other scenes include the sed festival, a festival of the god Min and scenes showing Pepi executing a Libyan chieftain, who is accompanied by his wife and son. He is shown at a much smaller scale than his mother. The difference in size may refer to the time period when his mother served as a regent.

Several 6th Dynasty royal seals and stone blocks – the latter of which were found within the funerary temple of Queen Ankhesenpepi II, the known mother of Pepi II – were discovered in the 1999–2000 excavation season at Saqqara, which demonstrate that she also married Merenre after Pepi I's death and became this king's chief wife.A.

An alabaster statuette in the Brooklyn Museum depicts a young Pepi II, in full kingly regalia, sitting on the lap of his mother. A glimpse of the personality of the pharaoh while he was still a child can be found in a letter he wrote to Harkhuf, a governor of Aswan and the head of one of the expeditions he sent into Nubia. Over his long life Pepi II had several wives, including:  Neith – She was the mother of Pepi's successor Merenre Nemtyemsaf II.Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan. Ankhesenpepi III She was the daughter of Merenre Nemtyemsaf I and hence a granddaughter of Pepi I.  Ankhesenpepi IV – The mother of King Neferkare according to texts in her tomb. Other scenes include the sed festival, a festival of the god Min and scenes showing Pepi executing a Libyan chieftain, who is accompanied by his wife and son. He is shown at a much smaller scale than his mother. The difference in size may refer to the time period when his mother served as a regent. The king is shown as a naked child. 2004. p 288,  It is then believed that he was in turn succeeded by the obscure pharaoh Neitiqerty Siptah, though according to popular tradition (as recorded by Manetho two millennia later) he was succeeded by Queen Nitocris, who would be the first female ruler of Egypt.Shaw, Ian.
