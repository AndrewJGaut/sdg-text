EG-2008-5Z-00000542,1.0,"Background Napoleon Bonaparte's victories in northern Italy over the Austrian Empire helped secure victory for the French in the War of the First Coalition in 1797, and Great Britain remained the only major European power still at war with the French Republic.Maffeo, p. 224 The French Directory investigated a number of strategic options to counter British opposition, including projected invasions of Ireland and Britain and the expansion of the French Navy to challenge the Royal Navy at sea.James, p. 113 Despite significant efforts, British control of Northern European waters rendered these ambitions impractical in the short term,Padfield, p. 116 and the Royal Navy remained firmly in control of the Atlantic Ocean. Despite vocal opposition from Contre-amiral Armand Blanquet,Bradford, p. 199  who insisted that the fleet would be best able to respond in open water, the rest of the captains agreed that anchoring in a line of battle inside the bay presented the strongest tactic for confronting Nelson.James, p. 159 It is possible that Bonaparte envisaged Aboukir Bay as a temporary anchorage: on 27 July, he expressed the expectation that Brueys had already transferred his ships to Alexandria, and three days later, he issued orders for the fleet to make for Corfu in preparation for naval operations against the Ottoman territories in the Balkans,Rose, p. 143 although Bedouin partisansBradford, p. 192 intercepted and killed the courier carrying the instructions. In addition, the deployment of Brueys' fleet prevented the rear from effectively supporting the van due to the prevailing winds.Clowes, p. 372  A more pressing problem for Brueys was a lack of food and water for the fleet: Bonaparte had unloaded almost all of the provisions carried aboard and no supplies were reaching the ships from the shore. To remedy this, Brueys sent foraging parties of 25 men from each ship along the coast to requisition food, dig wells, and collect water. Brueys also hoped to lure the British fleet onto the shoals at Aboukir Island, sending the brigs  and Railleur to act as decoys in the shallow waters. This convinced Brueys that rather than risk an evening battle in confined waters, the British were planning to wait for the following day. The British had no charts of the depth or shape of the bay, except a rough sketch map Swiftsure had obtained from a merchant captain, an inaccurate British atlas on Zealous,Maffeo, p. 269 and a 35-year-old French map aboard Goliath.Adkins, p. 24 Hood replied that he would take careful soundings as he advanced to test the depth of the water,Clowes, p. 361 and that, ""If you will allow the honour of leading you into battle, I will keep the lead going. Captain Thomas Foley had noticed as he approached that there was an unexpected gap between Guerrier and the shallow water of the shoal. Her masts protruded from the water as survivors scrambled into boats and rowed for the shore. The concussion of the blast was powerful enough to rip open the seams of the nearest ships, and flaming wreckage landed in a huge circle, much of it flying directly over the surrounding ships into the sea beyond.James, p. 171 Falling wreckage started fires on Swiftsure, Alexander, and Franklin, although in each case teams of sailors with water buckets succeeded in extinguishing the flames, despite a secondary explosion on Franklin.Mostert, p. 271 [[File:Luny Thomas Battle Of The Nile August 1st 1798 At 10pm.jpg|thumb|Battle of the Nile, Thomas Luny, 1834|alt=A confused naval battle. The fire rapidly spread through the admiral's cabin and into a ready magazine that stored carcass ammunition, which was designed to burn more fiercely in water than in air. During the lull, Nelson gave orders that boats be sent to pull survivors from the water around the remains of Orient. Troubridge, having finally dragged his ship off the shoal at 02:00, found that he had lost his rudder and was taking on more than  of water an hour. Many ships had only jury masts and it took a full day for the convoy to reach the mouth of the bay, finally sailing into open water on 15 August."

For several kilometers north of Khartoum, water closer to the eastern bank of the river, coming from the Blue Nile, is visibly muddy, while that closer to the western bank, and coming from the White Nile, is clearer. As a result of the dam's construction, the Nile actually begins its flow into Egypt as Lake Nasser, which extends southwards from the dam for 320  km to the border and for an additional 158  km within Sudan. Lake Nasser's waters fill the area through Lower Nubia (Upper Egypt and northern Sudan) within the narrow canyon between the cliffs of sandstone and granite created by the flow of the river over many centuries. Archaeological research indicates that people once lived at a much higher elevation along the river than they do today, probably because the river was higher or the floods more severe. The dams have also affected the Nile Valley's fertility, which was dependent for centuries not only on the water brought to the arable land but also on the materials left by the water. The reduction in annual silt deposits has contributed to rising water tables and increasing soil salinity in the Delta, the erosion of the river's banks in Upper Egypt, and the erosion of the alluvial fan along the shore of the Mediterranean Sea. Limited agricultural production, the presence of some natural resources, and permanent settlements are found in the other six depressions, all of which have fresh water provided by the Nile or by local groundwater."

By February 1916, however, there was no apparent sign of any unusual military activity in the Sinai itself, when the British began construction on the first  stretch of  standard gauge railway and water pipeline from Kantara to Romani and Katia.Bruce 2002, pp. Between 21 March and 11 April the water sources at Wady Um Muksheib, Moya Harab and Jifjafa along the central Sinai route from southern Palestine were destroyed.

This column, consisting of engineers and units of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, the Bikaner Camel Corps, and the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps drained  of water from pools and cisterns in the Wadi Mukhsheib and sealed the cisterns. After a long night's march, the German and Ottoman troops faced a difficult day under the desert sun without being able to replenish their water and exposed to artillery fire from Romani. 189–90  When darkness put an end to the fighting, the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades established an outpost line and spent the night on the battlefield, while the New Zealand Mounted Rifles and 5th Mounted Brigades withdrew for water and rations at Pelusium Station, where the newly arrived infantry brigades of the 42nd Division were assembling. [AWM4-10-3-19 War Diary of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade August 1916] At 19:30, when the New Zealand Mounted Rifle and 5th Mounted Brigades moved from the positions they had won to water and rest at Pelusium, the area was consolidated by infantry in the 127th (Manchester) Brigade, 42nd Division. They could not have been in good shape after fighting all the previous day in intense midsummer heat and having to remain in position overnight, far from water and harassed by British infantry. Their situation was now precarious, as their main attacking force was well past the right of the main British infantry positions; infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division was closer to the nearest enemy-controlled water source at Katia than most of the attacking force. They were supported by the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps, which worked with the Army Service Corps to supply them with drinking water.McPherson 1983, pp. They could not match the pace and endurance of the well-trained German and Ottoman force and were hampered by water supply problems.Bruce 2002 p. 47Erickson 2001 p. 155  At 06:30, when Lawrence ordered Chauvel to take command of all mounted troops (excluding the Mobile Column), the New Zealand Mounted Rifles, the 5th Mounted and the 3rd Light Horse Brigades were somewhat scattered. 179, 196  On 7 August the Greater Bairam (a feast day celebrating the end of the Islamic year) coincided with the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps at Romani being ordered to move out with supplies for the advancing troops, but 150 men, most of whom were past the end of their contracts and entitled to be discharged, refused orders to fill their water bottles, draw their rations and saddle up. On the left of the New Zealanders, Royston's Column; a composite of the depleted 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades, had gone to Katia to water and had then march through the night to the Hod Hamada  north-west of Bir el Abd, where they arrived at 03:00 on 9 August. Chauvel ordered the division to return to water at Oghratina, despite Lawrence's wish for them to bivouac close to Bir el Abd but Chauvel concluded that his force was in no condition to remain within reach of this strong and aggressive enemy force. Cisterns and other works were constructed along this route to store water and at Wadi El Arish, enormous rock cut reservoirs were under construction in December 1916 when the Anzac Mounted Division reached that place just before the Battle of Magdhaba.Powles 1922, p. 40  Murray, Lawrence and Chauvel have all been criticised for letting von Kressenstein's force escape. The infantry's difficulties regarding the supply of water and camel transport combined with their lack of desert training, together with Lawrence's confusing orders for infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division to move south and east, stopped them from promptly advancing to cut off the retreating force in the early hours of the second day's battle.Falls 1930 p. 201 General Lawrence was criticised for taking a grave and unnecessary risk by relying on just one entrenched infantry division and two light horse brigades to defend Romani."

Despite vocal opposition from Contre-amiral Armand Blanquet,Bradford, p. 199  who insisted that the fleet would be best able to respond in open water, the rest of the captains agreed that anchoring in a line of battle inside the bay presented the strongest tactic for confronting Nelson.James, p. 159 It is possible that Bonaparte envisaged Aboukir Bay as a temporary anchorage: on 27 July, he expressed the expectation that Brueys had already transferred his ships to Alexandria, and three days later, he issued orders for the fleet to make for Corfu in preparation for naval operations against the Ottoman territories in the Balkans,Rose, p. 143 although Bedouin partisansBradford, p. 192 intercepted and killed the courier carrying the instructions. In addition, the deployment of Brueys' fleet prevented the rear from effectively supporting the van due to the prevailing winds.Clowes, p. 372  A more pressing problem for Brueys was a lack of food and water for the fleet: Bonaparte had unloaded almost all of the provisions carried aboard and no supplies were reaching the ships from the shore. To remedy this, Brueys sent foraging parties of 25 men from each ship along the coast to requisition food, dig wells, and collect water. Brueys also hoped to lure the British fleet onto the shoals at Aboukir Island, sending the brigs  and Railleur to act as decoys in the shallow waters. This convinced Brueys that rather than risk an evening battle in confined waters, the British were planning to wait for the following day. The British had no charts of the depth or shape of the bay, except a rough sketch map Swiftsure had obtained from a merchant captain, an inaccurate British atlas on Zealous,Maffeo, p. 269 and a 35-year-old French map aboard Goliath.Adkins, p. 24 Hood replied that he would take careful soundings as he advanced to test the depth of the water,Clowes, p. 361 and that, ""If you will allow the honour of leading you into battle, I will keep the lead going. Captain Thomas Foley had noticed as he approached that there was an unexpected gap between Guerrier and the shallow water of the shoal. Her masts protruded from the water as survivors scrambled into boats and rowed for the shore. The concussion of the blast was powerful enough to rip open the seams of the nearest ships, and flaming wreckage landed in a huge circle, much of it flying directly over the surrounding ships into the sea beyond.James, p. 171 Falling wreckage started fires on Swiftsure, Alexander, and Franklin, although in each case teams of sailors with water buckets succeeded in extinguishing the flames, despite a secondary explosion on Franklin.Mostert, p. 271 [[File:Luny Thomas Battle Of The Nile August 1st 1798 At 10pm.jpg|thumb|Battle of the Nile, Thomas Luny, 1834|alt=A confused naval battle. The fire rapidly spread through the admiral's cabin and into a ready magazine that stored carcass ammunition, which was designed to burn more fiercely in water than in air. During the lull, Nelson gave orders that boats be sent to pull survivors from the water around the remains of Orient. Troubridge, having finally dragged his ship off the shoal at 02:00, found that he had lost his rudder and was taking on more than  of water an hour. Many ships had only jury masts and it took a full day for the convoy to reach the mouth of the bay, finally sailing into open water on 15 August."

For several kilometers north of Khartoum, water closer to the eastern bank of the river, coming from the Blue Nile, is visibly muddy, while that closer to the western bank, and coming from the White Nile, is clearer. As a result of the dam's construction, the Nile actually begins its flow into Egypt as Lake Nasser, which extends southwards from the dam for 320  km to the border and for an additional 158  km within Sudan. Lake Nasser's waters fill the area through Lower Nubia (Upper Egypt and northern Sudan) within the narrow canyon between the cliffs of sandstone and granite created by the flow of the river over many centuries. Archaeological research indicates that people once lived at a much higher elevation along the river than they do today, probably because the river was higher or the floods more severe. The dams have also affected the Nile Valley's fertility, which was dependent for centuries not only on the water brought to the arable land but also on the materials left by the water. The reduction in annual silt deposits has contributed to rising water tables and increasing soil salinity in the Delta, the erosion of the river's banks in Upper Egypt, and the erosion of the alluvial fan along the shore of the Mediterranean Sea. Limited agricultural production, the presence of some natural resources, and permanent settlements are found in the other six depressions, all of which have fresh water provided by the Nile or by local groundwater."

Israeli forces then raided and seized the Gaza-bound ships in international waters of the Mediterranean. For the initial leg of the voyage, six of the eight ships set out on 30 May 2010 from international waters off the coast of Cyprus; the remaining two were delayed by mechanical problems. The Israeli Navy made initial contact with the flotilla at 11 p.m. (2000 UTC) on 30 May, about  northwest of Gaza,  off the coast of southern Lebanon, in international waters, ordering the ships to follow them to port or otherwise be boarded.

Israeli forces then raided and seized the Gaza-bound ships in international waters of the Mediterranean. For the initial leg of the voyage, six of the eight ships set out on 30 May 2010 from international waters off the coast of Cyprus; the remaining two were delayed by mechanical problems. The Israeli Navy made initial contact with the flotilla at 11 p.m. (2000 UTC) on 30 May, about  northwest of Gaza,  off the coast of southern Lebanon, in international waters, ordering the ships to follow them to port or otherwise be boarded. As the boats approached, activists fired water hoses at them, and pelted them with a variety of objects. Two were given water and one with a severe stomach wound was given a gauze pad. At that point, he elbowed the activist in the ribs and jumped into the water, although the guard tried to hold him back.

Despite vocal opposition from Contre-amiral Armand Blanquet,Bradford, p. 199  who insisted that the fleet would be best able to respond in open water, the rest of the captains agreed that anchoring in a line of battle inside the bay presented the strongest tactic for confronting Nelson.James, p. 159 It is possible that Bonaparte envisaged Aboukir Bay as a temporary anchorage: on 27 July, he expressed the expectation that Brueys had already transferred his ships to Alexandria, and three days later, he issued orders for the fleet to make for Corfu in preparation for naval operations against the Ottoman territories in the Balkans,Rose, p. 143 although Bedouin partisansBradford, p. 192 intercepted and killed the courier carrying the instructions. In addition, the deployment of Brueys' fleet prevented the rear from effectively supporting the van due to the prevailing winds.Clowes, p. 372  A more pressing problem for Brueys was a lack of food and water for the fleet: Bonaparte had unloaded almost all of the provisions carried aboard and no supplies were reaching the ships from the shore. To remedy this, Brueys sent foraging parties of 25 men from each ship along the coast to requisition food, dig wells, and collect water. Brueys also hoped to lure the British fleet onto the shoals at Aboukir Island, sending the brigs  and Railleur to act as decoys in the shallow waters. This convinced Brueys that rather than risk an evening battle in confined waters, the British were planning to wait for the following day. The British had no charts of the depth or shape of the bay, except a rough sketch map Swiftsure had obtained from a merchant captain, an inaccurate British atlas on Zealous,Maffeo, p. 269 and a 35-year-old French map aboard Goliath.Adkins, p. 24 Hood replied that he would take careful soundings as he advanced to test the depth of the water,Clowes, p. 361 and that, ""If you will allow the honour of leading you into battle, I will keep the lead going. Captain Thomas Foley had noticed as he approached that there was an unexpected gap between Guerrier and the shallow water of the shoal. Her masts protruded from the water as survivors scrambled into boats and rowed for the shore. The concussion of the blast was powerful enough to rip open the seams of the nearest ships, and flaming wreckage landed in a huge circle, much of it flying directly over the surrounding ships into the sea beyond.James, p. 171 Falling wreckage started fires on Swiftsure, Alexander, and Franklin, although in each case teams of sailors with water buckets succeeded in extinguishing the flames, despite a secondary explosion on Franklin.Mostert, p. 271 [[File:Luny Thomas Battle Of The Nile August 1st 1798 At 10pm.jpg|thumb|Battle of the Nile, Thomas Luny, 1834|alt=A confused naval battle. The fire rapidly spread through the admiral's cabin and into a ready magazine that stored carcass ammunition, which was designed to burn more fiercely in water than in air. During the lull, Nelson gave orders that boats be sent to pull survivors from the water around the remains of Orient. Troubridge, having finally dragged his ship off the shoal at 02:00, found that he had lost his rudder and was taking on more than  of water an hour.

For several kilometers north of Khartoum, water closer to the eastern bank of the river, coming from the Blue Nile, is visibly muddy, while that closer to the western bank, and coming from the White Nile, is clearer. As a result of the dam's construction, the Nile actually begins its flow into Egypt as Lake Nasser, which extends southwards from the dam for 320  km to the border and for an additional 158  km within Sudan. Lake Nasser's waters fill the area through Lower Nubia (Upper Egypt and northern Sudan) within the narrow canyon between the cliffs of sandstone and granite created by the flow of the river over many centuries. Archaeological research indicates that people once lived at a much higher elevation along the river than they do today, probably because the river was higher or the floods more severe. The dams have also affected the Nile Valley's fertility, which was dependent for centuries not only on the water brought to the arable land but also on the materials left by the water. The reduction in annual silt deposits has contributed to rising water tables and increasing soil salinity in the Delta, the erosion of the river's banks in Upper Egypt, and the erosion of the alluvial fan along the shore of the Mediterranean Sea. Limited agricultural production, the presence of some natural resources, and permanent settlements are found in the other six depressions, all of which have fresh water provided by the Nile or by local groundwater."

Israeli forces then raided and seized the Gaza-bound ships in international waters of the Mediterranean. For the initial leg of the voyage, six of the eight ships set out on 30 May 2010 from international waters off the coast of Cyprus; the remaining two were delayed by mechanical problems. The Israeli Navy made initial contact with the flotilla at 11 p.m. (2000 UTC) on 30 May, about  northwest of Gaza,  off the coast of southern Lebanon, in international waters, ordering the ships to follow them to port or otherwise be boarded. As the boats approached, activists fired water hoses at them, and pelted them with a variety of objects. Two were given water and one with a severe stomach wound was given a gauze pad. At that point, he elbowed the activist in the ribs and jumped into the water, although the guard tried to hold him back. A second soldier also jumped into the water, while the third remained unconscious on the deck. IDF soldiers dispersed the activists with non-lethal weapons, and rescued the unconscious soldier, while the two soldiers in the water were picked up by the speedboats. When two soldiers entered the bridge, an activist grabbed the wheel tightly and protested that the boat was in international waters.

They could not have been in good shape after fighting all the previous day in intense midsummer heat and having to remain in position overnight, far from water and harassed by British infantry. Their situation was now precarious, as their main attacking force was well past the right of the main British infantry positions; infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division was closer to the nearest enemy-controlled water source at Katia than most of the attacking force.

Chauvel ordered the division to return to water at Oghratina, despite Lawrence's wish for them to bivouac close to Bir el Abd but Chauvel concluded that his force was in no condition to remain within reach of this strong and aggressive enemy force. Cisterns and other works were constructed along this route to store water and at Wadi El Arish, enormous rock cut reservoirs were under construction in December 1916 when the Anzac Mounted Division reached that place just before the Battle of Magdhaba.Powles 1922, p. 40  Murray, Lawrence and Chauvel have all been criticised for letting von Kressenstein's force escape. The infantry's difficulties regarding the supply of water and camel transport combined with their lack of desert training, together with Lawrence's confusing orders for infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division to move south and east, stopped them from promptly advancing to cut off the retreating force in the early hours of the second day's battle.Falls 1930 p. 201 General Lawrence was criticised for taking a grave and unnecessary risk by relying on just one entrenched infantry division and two light horse brigades to defend Romani."

[AWM4-10-3-19 War Diary of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade August 1916] At 19:30, when the New Zealand Mounted Rifle and 5th Mounted Brigades moved from the positions they had won to water and rest at Pelusium, the area was consolidated by infantry in the 127th (Manchester) Brigade, 42nd Division. They could not have been in good shape after fighting all the previous day in intense midsummer heat and having to remain in position overnight, far from water and harassed by British infantry. Their situation was now precarious, as their main attacking force was well past the right of the main British infantry positions; infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division was closer to the nearest enemy-controlled water source at Katia than most of the attacking force. They were supported by the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps, which worked with the Army Service Corps to supply them with drinking water.McPherson 1983, pp. They could not match the pace and endurance of the well-trained German and Ottoman force and were hampered by water supply problems.Bruce 2002 p. 47Erickson 2001 p. 155  At 06:30, when Lawrence ordered Chauvel to take command of all mounted troops (excluding the Mobile Column), the New Zealand Mounted Rifles, the 5th Mounted and the 3rd Light Horse Brigades were somewhat scattered. 179, 196  On 7 August the Greater Bairam (a feast day celebrating the end of the Islamic year) coincided with the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps at Romani being ordered to move out with supplies for the advancing troops, but 150 men, most of whom were past the end of their contracts and entitled to be discharged, refused orders to fill their water bottles, draw their rations and saddle up. On the left of the New Zealanders, Royston's Column; a composite of the depleted 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades, had gone to Katia to water and had then march through the night to the Hod Hamada  north-west of Bir el Abd, where they arrived at 03:00 on 9 August. Chauvel ordered the division to return to water at Oghratina, despite Lawrence's wish for them to bivouac close to Bir el Abd but Chauvel concluded that his force was in no condition to remain within reach of this strong and aggressive enemy force. Cisterns and other works were constructed along this route to store water and at Wadi El Arish, enormous rock cut reservoirs were under construction in December 1916 when the Anzac Mounted Division reached that place just before the Battle of Magdhaba.Powles 1922, p. 40  Murray, Lawrence and Chauvel have all been criticised for letting von Kressenstein's force escape. The infantry's difficulties regarding the supply of water and camel transport combined with their lack of desert training, together with Lawrence's confusing orders for infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division to move south and east, stopped them from promptly advancing to cut off the retreating force in the early hours of the second day's battle.Falls 1930 p. 201 General Lawrence was criticised for taking a grave and unnecessary risk by relying on just one entrenched infantry division and two light horse brigades to defend Romani."

This column, consisting of engineers and units of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, the Bikaner Camel Corps, and the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps drained  of water from pools and cisterns in the Wadi Mukhsheib and sealed the cisterns. After a long night's march, the German and Ottoman troops faced a difficult day under the desert sun without being able to replenish their water and exposed to artillery fire from Romani. 189–90  When darkness put an end to the fighting, the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades established an outpost line and spent the night on the battlefield, while the New Zealand Mounted Rifles and 5th Mounted Brigades withdrew for water and rations at Pelusium Station, where the newly arrived infantry brigades of the 42nd Division were assembling. [AWM4-10-3-19 War Diary of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade August 1916] At 19:30, when the New Zealand Mounted Rifle and 5th Mounted Brigades moved from the positions they had won to water and rest at Pelusium, the area was consolidated by infantry in the 127th (Manchester) Brigade, 42nd Division. They could not have been in good shape after fighting all the previous day in intense midsummer heat and having to remain in position overnight, far from water and harassed by British infantry. Their situation was now precarious, as their main attacking force was well past the right of the main British infantry positions; infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division was closer to the nearest enemy-controlled water source at Katia than most of the attacking force. They were supported by the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps, which worked with the Army Service Corps to supply them with drinking water.McPherson 1983, pp. They could not match the pace and endurance of the well-trained German and Ottoman force and were hampered by water supply problems.Bruce 2002 p. 47Erickson 2001 p. 155  At 06:30, when Lawrence ordered Chauvel to take command of all mounted troops (excluding the Mobile Column), the New Zealand Mounted Rifles, the 5th Mounted and the 3rd Light Horse Brigades were somewhat scattered. 179, 196  On 7 August the Greater Bairam (a feast day celebrating the end of the Islamic year) coincided with the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps at Romani being ordered to move out with supplies for the advancing troops, but 150 men, most of whom were past the end of their contracts and entitled to be discharged, refused orders to fill their water bottles, draw their rations and saddle up. On the left of the New Zealanders, Royston's Column; a composite of the depleted 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades, had gone to Katia to water and had then march through the night to the Hod Hamada  north-west of Bir el Abd, where they arrived at 03:00 on 9 August. Chauvel ordered the division to return to water at Oghratina, despite Lawrence's wish for them to bivouac close to Bir el Abd but Chauvel concluded that his force was in no condition to remain within reach of this strong and aggressive enemy force. Cisterns and other works were constructed along this route to store water and at Wadi El Arish, enormous rock cut reservoirs were under construction in December 1916 when the Anzac Mounted Division reached that place just before the Battle of Magdhaba.Powles 1922, p. 40  Murray, Lawrence and Chauvel have all been criticised for letting von Kressenstein's force escape. The infantry's difficulties regarding the supply of water and camel transport combined with their lack of desert training, together with Lawrence's confusing orders for infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division to move south and east, stopped them from promptly advancing to cut off the retreating force in the early hours of the second day's battle.Falls 1930 p. 201 General Lawrence was criticised for taking a grave and unnecessary risk by relying on just one entrenched infantry division and two light horse brigades to defend Romani."

Despite vocal opposition from Contre-amiral Armand Blanquet,Bradford, p. 199  who insisted that the fleet would be best able to respond in open water, the rest of the captains agreed that anchoring in a line of battle inside the bay presented the strongest tactic for confronting Nelson.James, p. 159 It is possible that Bonaparte envisaged Aboukir Bay as a temporary anchorage: on 27 July, he expressed the expectation that Brueys had already transferred his ships to Alexandria, and three days later, he issued orders for the fleet to make for Corfu in preparation for naval operations against the Ottoman territories in the Balkans,Rose, p. 143 although Bedouin partisansBradford, p. 192 intercepted and killed the courier carrying the instructions. In addition, the deployment of Brueys' fleet prevented the rear from effectively supporting the van due to the prevailing winds.Clowes, p. 372  A more pressing problem for Brueys was a lack of food and water for the fleet: Bonaparte had unloaded almost all of the provisions carried aboard and no supplies were reaching the ships from the shore. To remedy this, Brueys sent foraging parties of 25 men from each ship along the coast to requisition food, dig wells, and collect water. Brueys also hoped to lure the British fleet onto the shoals at Aboukir Island, sending the brigs  and Railleur to act as decoys in the shallow waters. This convinced Brueys that rather than risk an evening battle in confined waters, the British were planning to wait for the following day. The British had no charts of the depth or shape of the bay, except a rough sketch map Swiftsure had obtained from a merchant captain, an inaccurate British atlas on Zealous,Maffeo, p. 269 and a 35-year-old French map aboard Goliath.Adkins, p. 24 Hood replied that he would take careful soundings as he advanced to test the depth of the water,Clowes, p. 361 and that, ""If you will allow the honour of leading you into battle, I will keep the lead going. Captain Thomas Foley had noticed as he approached that there was an unexpected gap between Guerrier and the shallow water of the shoal. Her masts protruded from the water as survivors scrambled into boats and rowed for the shore. The concussion of the blast was powerful enough to rip open the seams of the nearest ships, and flaming wreckage landed in a huge circle, much of it flying directly over the surrounding ships into the sea beyond.James, p. 171 Falling wreckage started fires on Swiftsure, Alexander, and Franklin, although in each case teams of sailors with water buckets succeeded in extinguishing the flames, despite a secondary explosion on Franklin.Mostert, p. 271 [[File:Luny Thomas Battle Of The Nile August 1st 1798 At 10pm.jpg|thumb|Battle of the Nile, Thomas Luny, 1834|alt=A confused naval battle. The fire rapidly spread through the admiral's cabin and into a ready magazine that stored carcass ammunition, which was designed to burn more fiercely in water than in air. During the lull, Nelson gave orders that boats be sent to pull survivors from the water around the remains of Orient. Troubridge, having finally dragged his ship off the shoal at 02:00, found that he had lost his rudder and was taking on more than  of water an hour.

For several kilometers north of Khartoum, water closer to the eastern bank of the river, coming from the Blue Nile, is visibly muddy, while that closer to the western bank, and coming from the White Nile, is clearer. As a result of the dam's construction, the Nile actually begins its flow into Egypt as Lake Nasser, which extends southwards from the dam for 320  km to the border and for an additional 158  km within Sudan. Lake Nasser's waters fill the area through Lower Nubia (Upper Egypt and northern Sudan) within the narrow canyon between the cliffs of sandstone and granite created by the flow of the river over many centuries. Archaeological research indicates that people once lived at a much higher elevation along the river than they do today, probably because the river was higher or the floods more severe. The dams have also affected the Nile Valley's fertility, which was dependent for centuries not only on the water brought to the arable land but also on the materials left by the water. The reduction in annual silt deposits has contributed to rising water tables and increasing soil salinity in the Delta, the erosion of the river's banks in Upper Egypt, and the erosion of the alluvial fan along the shore of the Mediterranean Sea. Limited agricultural production, the presence of some natural resources, and permanent settlements are found in the other six depressions, all of which have fresh water provided by the Nile or by local groundwater."

They were supported by the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps, which worked with the Army Service Corps to supply them with drinking water.McPherson 1983, pp. They could not match the pace and endurance of the well-trained German and Ottoman force and were hampered by water supply problems.Bruce 2002 p. 47Erickson 2001 p. 155  At 06:30, when Lawrence ordered Chauvel to take command of all mounted troops (excluding the Mobile Column), the New Zealand Mounted Rifles, the 5th Mounted and the 3rd Light Horse Brigades were somewhat scattered. 179, 196  On 7 August the Greater Bairam (a feast day celebrating the end of the Islamic year) coincided with the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps at Romani being ordered to move out with supplies for the advancing troops, but 150 men, most of whom were past the end of their contracts and entitled to be discharged, refused orders to fill their water bottles, draw their rations and saddle up. On the left of the New Zealanders, Royston's Column; a composite of the depleted 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades, had gone to Katia to water and had then march through the night to the Hod Hamada  north-west of Bir el Abd, where they arrived at 03:00 on 9 August. Chauvel ordered the division to return to water at Oghratina, despite Lawrence's wish for them to bivouac close to Bir el Abd but Chauvel concluded that his force was in no condition to remain within reach of this strong and aggressive enemy force. Cisterns and other works were constructed along this route to store water and at Wadi El Arish, enormous rock cut reservoirs were under construction in December 1916 when the Anzac Mounted Division reached that place just before the Battle of Magdhaba.Powles 1922, p. 40  Murray, Lawrence and Chauvel have all been criticised for letting von Kressenstein's force escape. The infantry's difficulties regarding the supply of water and camel transport combined with their lack of desert training, together with Lawrence's confusing orders for infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division to move south and east, stopped them from promptly advancing to cut off the retreating force in the early hours of the second day's battle.Falls 1930 p. 201 General Lawrence was criticised for taking a grave and unnecessary risk by relying on just one entrenched infantry division and two light horse brigades to defend Romani."

They were supported by the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps, which worked with the Army Service Corps to supply them with drinking water.McPherson 1983, pp. They could not match the pace and endurance of the well-trained German and Ottoman force and were hampered by water supply problems.Bruce 2002 p. 47Erickson 2001 p. 155  At 06:30, when Lawrence ordered Chauvel to take command of all mounted troops (excluding the Mobile Column), the New Zealand Mounted Rifles, the 5th Mounted and the 3rd Light Horse Brigades were somewhat scattered. 179, 196  On 7 August the Greater Bairam (a feast day celebrating the end of the Islamic year) coincided with the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps at Romani being ordered to move out with supplies for the advancing troops, but 150 men, most of whom were past the end of their contracts and entitled to be discharged, refused orders to fill their water bottles, draw their rations and saddle up. On the left of the New Zealanders, Royston's Column; a composite of the depleted 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades, had gone to Katia to water and had then march through the night to the Hod Hamada  north-west of Bir el Abd, where they arrived at 03:00 on 9 August. Chauvel ordered the division to return to water at Oghratina, despite Lawrence's wish for them to bivouac close to Bir el Abd but Chauvel concluded that his force was in no condition to remain within reach of this strong and aggressive enemy force. Cisterns and other works were constructed along this route to store water and at Wadi El Arish, enormous rock cut reservoirs were under construction in December 1916 when the Anzac Mounted Division reached that place just before the Battle of Magdhaba.Powles 1922, p. 40  Murray, Lawrence and Chauvel have all been criticised for letting von Kressenstein's force escape. The infantry's difficulties regarding the supply of water and camel transport combined with their lack of desert training, together with Lawrence's confusing orders for infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division to move south and east, stopped them from promptly advancing to cut off the retreating force in the early hours of the second day's battle.Falls 1930 p. 201 General Lawrence was criticised for taking a grave and unnecessary risk by relying on just one entrenched infantry division and two light horse brigades to defend Romani."

For several kilometers north of Khartoum, water closer to the eastern bank of the river, coming from the Blue Nile, is visibly muddy, while that closer to the western bank, and coming from the White Nile, is clearer. As a result of the dam's construction, the Nile actually begins its flow into Egypt as Lake Nasser, which extends southwards from the dam for 320  km to the border and for an additional 158  km within Sudan. Lake Nasser's waters fill the area through Lower Nubia (Upper Egypt and northern Sudan) within the narrow canyon between the cliffs of sandstone and granite created by the flow of the river over many centuries. Archaeological research indicates that people once lived at a much higher elevation along the river than they do today, probably because the river was higher or the floods more severe. The dams have also affected the Nile Valley's fertility, which was dependent for centuries not only on the water brought to the arable land but also on the materials left by the water. The reduction in annual silt deposits has contributed to rising water tables and increasing soil salinity in the Delta, the erosion of the river's banks in Upper Egypt, and the erosion of the alluvial fan along the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.

After a long night's march, the German and Ottoman troops faced a difficult day under the desert sun without being able to replenish their water and exposed to artillery fire from Romani. 189–90  When darkness put an end to the fighting, the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades established an outpost line and spent the night on the battlefield, while the New Zealand Mounted Rifles and 5th Mounted Brigades withdrew for water and rations at Pelusium Station, where the newly arrived infantry brigades of the 42nd Division were assembling. [AWM4-10-3-19 War Diary of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade August 1916] At 19:30, when the New Zealand Mounted Rifle and 5th Mounted Brigades moved from the positions they had won to water and rest at Pelusium, the area was consolidated by infantry in the 127th (Manchester) Brigade, 42nd Division. They could not have been in good shape after fighting all the previous day in intense midsummer heat and having to remain in position overnight, far from water and harassed by British infantry. Their situation was now precarious, as their main attacking force was well past the right of the main British infantry positions; infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division was closer to the nearest enemy-controlled water source at Katia than most of the attacking force. They were supported by the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps, which worked with the Army Service Corps to supply them with drinking water.McPherson 1983, pp. They could not match the pace and endurance of the well-trained German and Ottoman force and were hampered by water supply problems.Bruce 2002 p. 47Erickson 2001 p. 155  At 06:30, when Lawrence ordered Chauvel to take command of all mounted troops (excluding the Mobile Column), the New Zealand Mounted Rifles, the 5th Mounted and the 3rd Light Horse Brigades were somewhat scattered. 179, 196  On 7 August the Greater Bairam (a feast day celebrating the end of the Islamic year) coincided with the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps at Romani being ordered to move out with supplies for the advancing troops, but 150 men, most of whom were past the end of their contracts and entitled to be discharged, refused orders to fill their water bottles, draw their rations and saddle up. On the left of the New Zealanders, Royston's Column; a composite of the depleted 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades, had gone to Katia to water and had then march through the night to the Hod Hamada  north-west of Bir el Abd, where they arrived at 03:00 on 9 August. Chauvel ordered the division to return to water at Oghratina, despite Lawrence's wish for them to bivouac close to Bir el Abd but Chauvel concluded that his force was in no condition to remain within reach of this strong and aggressive enemy force. Cisterns and other works were constructed along this route to store water and at Wadi El Arish, enormous rock cut reservoirs were under construction in December 1916 when the Anzac Mounted Division reached that place just before the Battle of Magdhaba.Powles 1922, p. 40  Murray, Lawrence and Chauvel have all been criticised for letting von Kressenstein's force escape. The infantry's difficulties regarding the supply of water and camel transport combined with their lack of desert training, together with Lawrence's confusing orders for infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division to move south and east, stopped them from promptly advancing to cut off the retreating force in the early hours of the second day's battle.Falls 1930 p. 201 General Lawrence was criticised for taking a grave and unnecessary risk by relying on just one entrenched infantry division and two light horse brigades to defend Romani."

Israeli forces then raided and seized the Gaza-bound ships in international waters of the Mediterranean. For the initial leg of the voyage, six of the eight ships set out on 30 May 2010 from international waters off the coast of Cyprus; the remaining two were delayed by mechanical problems. The Israeli Navy made initial contact with the flotilla at 11 p.m. (2000 UTC) on 30 May, about  northwest of Gaza,  off the coast of southern Lebanon, in international waters, ordering the ships to follow them to port or otherwise be boarded. As the boats approached, activists fired water hoses at them, and pelted them with a variety of objects. Two were given water and one with a severe stomach wound was given a gauze pad. At that point, he elbowed the activist in the ribs and jumped into the water, although the guard tried to hold him back. A second soldier also jumped into the water, while the third remained unconscious on the deck. IDF soldiers dispersed the activists with non-lethal weapons, and rescued the unconscious soldier, while the two soldiers in the water were picked up by the speedboats. When two soldiers entered the bridge, an activist grabbed the wheel tightly and protested that the boat was in international waters. Upon entering Ashdod port, several passengers joined hands and refused to disembark, protesting that they had been brought to Israel against their will from international waters.

EG-2008-5Z-00000542,1.0,"Background Napoleon Bonaparte's victories in northern Italy over the Austrian Empire helped secure victory for the French in the War of the First Coalition in 1797, and Great Britain remained the only major European power still at war with the French Republic.Maffeo, p. 224 The French Directory investigated a number of strategic options to counter British opposition, including projected invasions of Ireland and Britain and the expansion of the French Navy to challenge the Royal Navy at sea.James, p. 113 Despite significant efforts, British control of Northern European waters rendered these ambitions impractical in the short term,Padfield, p. 116 and the Royal Navy remained firmly in control of the Atlantic Ocean. Despite vocal opposition from Contre-amiral Armand Blanquet,Bradford, p. 199  who insisted that the fleet would be best able to respond in open water, the rest of the captains agreed that anchoring in a line of battle inside the bay presented the strongest tactic for confronting Nelson.James, p. 159 It is possible that Bonaparte envisaged Aboukir Bay as a temporary anchorage: on 27 July, he expressed the expectation that Brueys had already transferred his ships to Alexandria, and three days later, he issued orders for the fleet to make for Corfu in preparation for naval operations against the Ottoman territories in the Balkans,Rose, p. 143 although Bedouin partisansBradford, p. 192 intercepted and killed the courier carrying the instructions. In addition, the deployment of Brueys' fleet prevented the rear from effectively supporting the van due to the prevailing winds.Clowes, p. 372  A more pressing problem for Brueys was a lack of food and water for the fleet: Bonaparte had unloaded almost all of the provisions carried aboard and no supplies were reaching the ships from the shore. To remedy this, Brueys sent foraging parties of 25 men from each ship along the coast to requisition food, dig wells, and collect water. Brueys also hoped to lure the British fleet onto the shoals at Aboukir Island, sending the brigs  and Railleur to act as decoys in the shallow waters. This convinced Brueys that rather than risk an evening battle in confined waters, the British were planning to wait for the following day. The British had no charts of the depth or shape of the bay, except a rough sketch map Swiftsure had obtained from a merchant captain, an inaccurate British atlas on Zealous,Maffeo, p. 269 and a 35-year-old French map aboard Goliath.Adkins, p. 24 Hood replied that he would take careful soundings as he advanced to test the depth of the water,Clowes, p. 361 and that, ""If you will allow the honour of leading you into battle, I will keep the lead going. Captain Thomas Foley had noticed as he approached that there was an unexpected gap between Guerrier and the shallow water of the shoal. Her masts protruded from the water as survivors scrambled into boats and rowed for the shore. The concussion of the blast was powerful enough to rip open the seams of the nearest ships, and flaming wreckage landed in a huge circle, much of it flying directly over the surrounding ships into the sea beyond.James, p. 171 Falling wreckage started fires on Swiftsure, Alexander, and Franklin, although in each case teams of sailors with water buckets succeeded in extinguishing the flames, despite a secondary explosion on Franklin.Mostert, p. 271 [[File:Luny Thomas Battle Of The Nile August 1st 1798 At 10pm.jpg|thumb|Battle of the Nile, Thomas Luny, 1834|alt=A confused naval battle. The fire rapidly spread through the admiral's cabin and into a ready magazine that stored carcass ammunition, which was designed to burn more fiercely in water than in air. During the lull, Nelson gave orders that boats be sent to pull survivors from the water around the remains of Orient. Troubridge, having finally dragged his ship off the shoal at 02:00, found that he had lost his rudder and was taking on more than  of water an hour. Many ships had only jury masts and it took a full day for the convoy to reach the mouth of the bay, finally sailing into open water on 15 August."

For several kilometers north of Khartoum, water closer to the eastern bank of the river, coming from the Blue Nile, is visibly muddy, while that closer to the western bank, and coming from the White Nile, is clearer. As a result of the dam's construction, the Nile actually begins its flow into Egypt as Lake Nasser, which extends southwards from the dam for 320  km to the border and for an additional 158  km within Sudan. Lake Nasser's waters fill the area through Lower Nubia (Upper Egypt and northern Sudan) within the narrow canyon between the cliffs of sandstone and granite created by the flow of the river over many centuries. Archaeological research indicates that people once lived at a much higher elevation along the river than they do today, probably because the river was higher or the floods more severe. The dams have also affected the Nile Valley's fertility, which was dependent for centuries not only on the water brought to the arable land but also on the materials left by the water. The reduction in annual silt deposits has contributed to rising water tables and increasing soil salinity in the Delta, the erosion of the river's banks in Upper Egypt, and the erosion of the alluvial fan along the shore of the Mediterranean Sea. Limited agricultural production, the presence of some natural resources, and permanent settlements are found in the other six depressions, all of which have fresh water provided by the Nile or by local groundwater."

EG-2008-5Z-00000542,1.0,"Background Napoleon Bonaparte's victories in northern Italy over the Austrian Empire helped secure victory for the French in the War of the First Coalition in 1797, and Great Britain remained the only major European power still at war with the French Republic.Maffeo, p. 224 The French Directory investigated a number of strategic options to counter British opposition, including projected invasions of Ireland and Britain and the expansion of the French Navy to challenge the Royal Navy at sea.James, p. 113 Despite significant efforts, British control of Northern European waters rendered these ambitions impractical in the short term,Padfield, p. 116 and the Royal Navy remained firmly in control of the Atlantic Ocean. Despite vocal opposition from Contre-amiral Armand Blanquet,Bradford, p. 199  who insisted that the fleet would be best able to respond in open water, the rest of the captains agreed that anchoring in a line of battle inside the bay presented the strongest tactic for confronting Nelson.James, p. 159 It is possible that Bonaparte envisaged Aboukir Bay as a temporary anchorage: on 27 July, he expressed the expectation that Brueys had already transferred his ships to Alexandria, and three days later, he issued orders for the fleet to make for Corfu in preparation for naval operations against the Ottoman territories in the Balkans,Rose, p. 143 although Bedouin partisansBradford, p. 192 intercepted and killed the courier carrying the instructions. In addition, the deployment of Brueys' fleet prevented the rear from effectively supporting the van due to the prevailing winds.Clowes, p. 372  A more pressing problem for Brueys was a lack of food and water for the fleet: Bonaparte had unloaded almost all of the provisions carried aboard and no supplies were reaching the ships from the shore. To remedy this, Brueys sent foraging parties of 25 men from each ship along the coast to requisition food, dig wells, and collect water. Brueys also hoped to lure the British fleet onto the shoals at Aboukir Island, sending the brigs  and Railleur to act as decoys in the shallow waters. This convinced Brueys that rather than risk an evening battle in confined waters, the British were planning to wait for the following day. The British had no charts of the depth or shape of the bay, except a rough sketch map Swiftsure had obtained from a merchant captain, an inaccurate British atlas on Zealous,Maffeo, p. 269 and a 35-year-old French map aboard Goliath.Adkins, p. 24 Hood replied that he would take careful soundings as he advanced to test the depth of the water,Clowes, p. 361 and that, ""If you will allow the honour of leading you into battle, I will keep the lead going. Captain Thomas Foley had noticed as he approached that there was an unexpected gap between Guerrier and the shallow water of the shoal. Her masts protruded from the water as survivors scrambled into boats and rowed for the shore. The concussion of the blast was powerful enough to rip open the seams of the nearest ships, and flaming wreckage landed in a huge circle, much of it flying directly over the surrounding ships into the sea beyond.James, p. 171 Falling wreckage started fires on Swiftsure, Alexander, and Franklin, although in each case teams of sailors with water buckets succeeded in extinguishing the flames, despite a secondary explosion on Franklin.Mostert, p. 271 [[File:Luny Thomas Battle Of The Nile August 1st 1798 At 10pm.jpg|thumb|Battle of the Nile, Thomas Luny, 1834|alt=A confused naval battle. The fire rapidly spread through the admiral's cabin and into a ready magazine that stored carcass ammunition, which was designed to burn more fiercely in water than in air. During the lull, Nelson gave orders that boats be sent to pull survivors from the water around the remains of Orient. Troubridge, having finally dragged his ship off the shoal at 02:00, found that he had lost his rudder and was taking on more than  of water an hour. Many ships had only jury masts and it took a full day for the convoy to reach the mouth of the bay, finally sailing into open water on 15 August."

For several kilometers north of Khartoum, water closer to the eastern bank of the river, coming from the Blue Nile, is visibly muddy, while that closer to the western bank, and coming from the White Nile, is clearer. As a result of the dam's construction, the Nile actually begins its flow into Egypt as Lake Nasser, which extends southwards from the dam for 320  km to the border and for an additional 158  km within Sudan. Lake Nasser's waters fill the area through Lower Nubia (Upper Egypt and northern Sudan) within the narrow canyon between the cliffs of sandstone and granite created by the flow of the river over many centuries. Archaeological research indicates that people once lived at a much higher elevation along the river than they do today, probably because the river was higher or the floods more severe. The dams have also affected the Nile Valley's fertility, which was dependent for centuries not only on the water brought to the arable land but also on the materials left by the water. The reduction in annual silt deposits has contributed to rising water tables and increasing soil salinity in the Delta, the erosion of the river's banks in Upper Egypt, and the erosion of the alluvial fan along the shore of the Mediterranean Sea. Limited agricultural production, the presence of some natural resources, and permanent settlements are found in the other six depressions, all of which have fresh water provided by the Nile or by local groundwater."

EG-2008-5Z-00000130,1.0,"  [[File:Gaza flotilla raid map.svg|thumb|350px|Routes of the Gaza-bound flotilla (green) and the Israeli Navy (orange)]]  The Gaza flotilla raid was a military operation by Israel against six civilian ships of the ""Gaza Freedom Flotilla"" on 31 May 2010 in international waters in the Mediterranean Sea. Israeli forces then raided and seized the Gaza-bound ships in international waters of the Mediterranean. For the initial leg of the voyage, six of the eight ships set out on 30 May 2010 from international waters off the coast of Cyprus; the remaining two were delayed by mechanical problems. The Israeli Navy made initial contact with the flotilla at 11 p.m. (2000 UTC) on 30 May, about  northwest of Gaza,  off the coast of southern Lebanon, in international waters, ordering the ships to follow them to port or otherwise be boarded. As the boats approached, activists fired water hoses at them, and pelted them with a variety of objects. Two were given water and one with a severe stomach wound was given a gauze pad. At that point, he elbowed the activist in the ribs and jumped into the water, although the guard tried to hold him back. A second soldier also jumped into the water, while the third remained unconscious on the deck. IDF soldiers dispersed the activists with non-lethal weapons, and rescued the unconscious soldier, while the two soldiers in the water were picked up by the speedboats. When two soldiers entered the bridge, an activist grabbed the wheel tightly and protested that the boat was in international waters. Upon entering Ashdod port, several passengers joined hands and refused to disembark, protesting that they had been brought to Israel against their will from international waters. Though it did not enter Israeli territorial waters, it sailed in ranges where warships typically update friendly nations of their presence to prevent misunderstandings. A Turkish newspaper also reported that three Turkish warships ready to deploy to the Mediterranean were instructed that if they encountered any Israeli warship outside Israel's territorial waters, they would come within 100 meters and neutralize the Israeli ship's weapons system. He said: ""We have no trust at all that Israel, a country that has carried out such an attack on a civilian convoy in international waters, will conduct an impartial investigation. Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz, Chicago Law School Professor Eric Posner, and Johns Hopkins international law Professor Ruth Wedgwood, said that the naval blockade and the boarding in international waters were in accord with long-standing international law, and comparable to other blockades in unrelated, historical conflicts.• •  Dershowitz and Posner also defended the specific use of force as legal."
