large quantity of ""high calibre bombs"", as well as other sundry explosives', ' On the afternoon of 27 January, a fire broke out in a street market being held next to the base, which was also home to

inland', '  Also thrown up by the blast were thousands of as yet unexploded military munitions, which fell in a rain of exploding shells, grenades and bullets casting further destruction across most of the northern section of the city', ' Thousands of people from Ikeja and neighbouring districts, seeing explosions and fires breaking out, fled their houses in an attempt to leave the affected

advised by city officials to remove or modernise the armoury, but took no action', ' On the evening of 28 January, George Emdin, the commander of the Ikeja base who had not been present during the

was making excuses for their mistakes and that nothing would be done to improve safety at other neglected ammunition dumps, many of which have not been properly maintained since Nigeria gained democracy in 1999 following twenty years of military rule', ' There were widespread fears in the immediate aftermath of the explosion that it signified the beginning of a military coup, although the government later released a statement ruling out this possibility', '  Numerous relief agencies, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent, provided aid to the thousands of homeless and lost people in the weeks following the disaster, attempting to reunite at least 2,000 separated or displaced families', ' People whose homes had survived were evacuated from Ikeja in order that military explosives

dam', '  Planning In 1969 the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) issued a report that recommended a small dam and irrigation scheme at Talata Mafara, with further upstream dams for flood control', ' The FAO report emphasized the importance of a gradual approach that would have minimal impact on existing land use patterns, in part because of lack of experience with irrigation projects in the region', ' In 1971 the Nigerian military government invited proposals for design and supervision of the project and, in 1972, awarded the job to Impressit Bakolori Nigeria, a company owned 60%

water available for farming, since a large sheet of water in a hot and arid area loses much to evaporation', ' In the downstream areas, of a total of 19,000 hectares of floodplain land, the dam

kingship, with the Aku Uka being considered son of a god', ' Of several gods, the sun god is paramount', ' The religion includes belief in communicating with the souls of the dead', '  These

was making excuses for their mistakes and that nothing would be done to improve safety at other neglected ammunition dumps, many of which have not been properly maintained since Nigeria gained democracy in 1999 following twenty years of military rule', ' There were widespread fears in the immediate aftermath of the explosion that it signified the beginning of a military coup, although the

advised by city officials to remove or modernise the armoury, but took no action', ' On the evening of 28 January, George Emdin, the commander of the Ikeja base who had not been present during the

to improve the storage facility, but this accident happened before the high authorities could do what was needed""  This statement provoked fury from the people of Lagos, who claimed that the military was making excuses for their mistakes and that nothing would be done to improve safety at other neglected ammunition dumps, many of which have not been properly maintained since Nigeria gained democracy in 1999 following twenty years of military rule', ' There were widespread fears in the immediate aftermath of the explosion that it signified the beginning of a military coup, although the government later released a statement ruling out this possibility', '  Numerous relief agencies, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent, provided aid to the thousands of homeless and lost people in the weeks following the disaster, attempting to reunite at least 2,000 separated or displaced families', ' People whose homes had survived were evacuated from Ikeja in order that military explosives experts could remove large quantities of unexploded munitions from the area', ' The evacuees and refugees were housed in temporary accommodation at the Ikeja Police College and the Abalti Barracks Yaba', ' The recovery process in Ikeja took some years as the rebuilding program was both lengthy and expensive, with many people suffering homelessness and poverty in this period due to the loss of

were vociferous in their demands and the authorities considered them as a clog in the wheel of their plans for the institution', ' In such a conservative environment, the university authority considered such radical demand for rights a taboo', ""  The allegations against the institution's authorities were still on when the parent ASUU commenced a national strike in April 2001"", ' The nationwide university strike was embarked upon against the backdrop of the general rot in universities across the country', ' Problems of poor infrastructure, poor funding, university autonomy, conditions of service for academic staff and academic freedom budgetary allocation were among the demands of ASUU', '  As usual with successive administrations, attempts were made to break the strike', ' In most of the universities, including the University of Ilorin, attendance registers were opened for lecturers who came to work to sign', ' This sent jitters down the spines of most of the lecturers who for fear of losing their jobs rushed to the institution on a daily basis to sign the registers', "" Those of them who believed strongly in the cause of the struggle shunned the register, daring the institution's authority threat to sack those lecturers who defied its order"", '  At the end of the day and consequent upon series of negotiation between the Federal Government and the ASUU leadership, the strike was called off not without an agreement to be implemented by both parties', ' ASUU reportedly ensured the insertion of a “no victimization clause” into the agreement', ' The essence of this was to guarantee that none of its members who partook in the strike would be persecuted because of their involvement', '  However, the University of Nigeria, (UNN), Nsukka and University of Ilorin terminated the appointment of some lecturers perceived to have played prominent roles in ensuring the success of the strike by ASUU', ' UNN authorities after public hues and cries

to the stagnation of some classes especially in the medical field which could not graduate students due to the sack of key lecturers', ' Still, some of the lecturers who could not immediately get alternative accommodation were forcefully ejected from their staff quarters', ""  Recourse to litigation: When the University of Ilorin authorities remained recalcitrant in its resolve not to reabsorb

fair hearing was “illegal and unconstitutional', '” The termination exercise was declared “null and void:” and the court ordered their earnest reinstatement', '  Nevertheless, the institution exercised its right of appeal when it challenged the judgment at the Court of Appeal', ' On July 12, 2006, the Court of Appeal sitting in Ilorin, Kwara State upturned the judgment of the Federal High Court by declaring that the university was in order by sacking the 49 lecturers', ' Out of the three Justices that sat over the case, two Justices, Muntaka Coomasie and T', ' Abdullahi ruled against the lecturers while Justice Helen Ogunwumiju ruled in favour of the lecturers', '  The Court of Appeal ruled that the lecturers should have taken their case to the National Industrial Court being a

arise', "" At another point, the court upheld the university's claim that the lecturers were given an opportunity for fair hearing while observing in another part that the lecturers were not sacked for any offense"", '  The judgment of the Court of Appeal was challenged by the lecturers at the Supreme Court', ""  After about eight years and 10 months of a tortuous legal battle, the 44 sacked lecturers of the University of Ilorin (UNILORIN) in Kwara State were ordered to be reinstated by Nigeria's Supreme Court on December 11, 2009"", ' The apex court ordered their immediate reinstatement

at an altitude of 13,000 ft', ' The interim report on the crash suggested that the flight was brought down by a lightning strike as thunderstorms were reportedly present during the time of the crash', '  The AIB noted that there was a formation of a large convective system near Flight 210 at the time of the accident', ' As they received satellite imagery information from Nigerian Meteorological

midnight over the southwestern part of the country', ' Satellite imagery obtained from Boeing also indicated strong convective storm activity near Flight 210', '  The presence of storm cells near Flight 210 could have caused disorientation to the pilots as it might have caused deterioration on the visibility, especially during night time', ' Since neither the horizon nor surface references

not identify the cause of the accident, but considered several factors:  The pilot-in-command (PIC) training of the Captain was inadequate, and the cumulative flight hours of the pilot in the days

' The aircraft had a number of technical defects and should not have been flown for either the accident flight or earlier flights', "" The airline failed to maintain an operating and maintenance

increase radar coverage to enhance air traffic services and assist in search and rescue operations', ' Bellview should improve its maintenance procedures and authorisations', ' Bellview should review its safety and quality control regime', '  Aftermath Nigerian state television announced three days of national mourning in response to the deaths of the 117 passengers and crew members on board', '

the toga of a national crisis started within the domain of University of Ilorin in January 2001', ' Those involved are Academic Staff Union of university (ASUU) - Unilorin branch activists who were battling the then vice-chancellor, Professor S', "" Oba Abdulraheem and the institution's authority over the delay in the payment of salaries, allowances, and other sundry welfare issues"", ' They were vociferous in their demands and the authorities considered them as a clog in the wheel of their plans for the institution', ' In such a conservative environment, the university authority considered such radical demand for rights a taboo', ""  The allegations against the institution's authorities were still on when the parent ASUU commenced a national strike in April 2001"", ' The nationwide university strike was embarked upon against the backdrop of the general rot in universities across the country', ' Problems of poor infrastructure, poor funding, university autonomy, conditions of service for academic staff and academic freedom budgetary allocation were among the demands of ASUU', '  As usual with successive administrations, attempts were made to break the strike', ' In most of the universities, including the University of Ilorin, attendance registers were opened for lecturers who came to work to sign', ' This sent jitters down the spines of most of the lecturers who for fear of losing their jobs rushed to the institution on a daily basis to sign the registers', "" Those of them who believed strongly in the cause of the struggle shunned the register, daring the institution's authority threat to sack those lecturers who defied its order"", '  At the end of the day and consequent upon series of negotiation between the Federal Government and the ASUU leadership, the strike was called off not without an agreement to be implemented by both parties', ' ASUU reportedly ensured the insertion of a “no victimization clause” into the agreement', ' The essence of this was to guarantee that none of its members who partook in the strike would be persecuted because of their involvement', '  However, the University of Nigeria, (UNN), Nsukka and University of Ilorin terminated the appointment of some lecturers perceived to have played prominent roles in ensuring the success of the strike by ASUU', ' UNN authorities after public hues and cries reinstated its sacked lecturers', ' But in Unilorin, its authorities refused to reverse itself', ' 103 lecturers were given sack letters that did not state the reasons behind the decision', 'http://thenationonlineng', 'net/acting-counsel-sacked-49-unilorin-lecturers-like-suicide-mission-olushola-bayeshea-san/   The breakdown of these figures are: 15 professors, two associate professors', ' 15 senior lecturer, 18 lecturers: 40 doctors and 12 medical school lecturers out of which 11 were consultants', '  Consequent upon this sack, the Ayo Banjo-committee was set up to look into the crisis', ' The committee report did not find any of the UNILORIN 49 guilty', "" While several others were re-absorbed into the system, the institution's authorities did not see any wisdom in recalling the UNILORIN 49 lecturers"", ' Afterall, they were seen as a fraction of about 700 lecturers in the university', '  However, among the sacked were deep intellectuals and key functionaries, which led to the stagnation of some classes especially in the medical field which could not graduate students due to the sack of key lecturers', ' Still, some of the lecturers who could not immediately get alternative accommodation were forcefully ejected from their staff quarters', ""  Recourse to litigation: When the University of Ilorin authorities remained recalcitrant in its resolve not to reabsorb the Unilorin 49, several external bodies acting as pressure groups intervened, sometimes pleading with the institution's authorities to reconsider its position"", ' Traditional rulers, Yoruba Council of Elders, National Assembly and Nigeria Inter-religious Council (NIREC), all tried to no avail to bring back peace to Unilorin and the entire university system in the country', ' The Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), the International Labour Organisation (ILO), UNESCO and a coalition of civil society organisations led by the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights (CDHR) also intervened to no avail', '  At this point, five of the Unilorin 49, led by Dr', ' Taiwo Oloruntoba-Oju, approached the Federal High Court, Ilorin to seek redress on behalf of their other colleagues', '  Precisely on July 26, 2005, the Federal High Court, Ilorin under Justice Peter Olayiwola, ruled that the termination of the appointment of the affected lecturers on account of participation in the strike without a fair hearing was “illegal and unconstitutional', '” The termination exercise was declared “null and void:” and the court ordered their earnest reinstatement', '  Nevertheless, the institution exercised its right of appeal when it challenged the judgment at the Court of Appeal', ' On July 12, 2006, the Court of Appeal sitting in Ilorin, Kwara State upturned the judgment of the Federal High Court by declaring that the university was in order by sacking the 49 lecturers', ' Out of the three Justices that sat over the case, two Justices, Muntaka Coomasie and T', ' Abdullahi ruled against the lecturers while Justice Helen Ogunwumiju ruled in favour of the lecturers', '  The Court of Appeal ruled that the lecturers should have taken their case to the National Industrial Court being a trade dispute matter as Union leaders: that the lecturers were not sacked for their role in the strike: that since the lecturers were not sacked for any offense, the issue of fair hearing did not arise', "" At another point, the court upheld the university's claim that the lecturers were given an opportunity for fair hearing while observing in another part that the lecturers were not sacked for any offense"", '  The judgment of the Court of Appeal was challenged by the lecturers at the Supreme Court', ""  After about eight years and 10 months of a tortuous legal battle, the 44 sacked lecturers of the University of Ilorin (UNILORIN) in Kwara State were ordered to be reinstated by Nigeria's Supreme Court on December 11, 2009"", ' The apex court ordered their immediate reinstatement and the payment of all their entitlements from February 2001, the date of their illegal disengagement, to date', ' The 5 UNILORIN ASUU leaders had earlier had their sack reversed by the same Supreme Court on June 12, 2009', '  This was reported to be the basis of the two decade - long feud between the University of Ilorin Chapter of the ASUU and the National Headquarters of the Union', ' Until 2009 when series of consultations between the two factions of the UNILORIN chapter of ASUU, led by Dr', ' Usman Raheem and Dr', ' Kayode Afolayan, and a delegation from the national headquarters of

daring the institution's authority threat to sack those lecturers who defied its order"", '  At the end of the day and consequent upon series of negotiation between the Federal Government and the ASUU leadership, the strike was called off not without an agreement to be implemented by both parties', ' ASUU reportedly ensured the insertion of a “no victimization clause” into the agreement', ' The

arise', "" At another point, the court upheld the university's claim that the lecturers were given an opportunity for fair hearing while observing in another part that the lecturers were not sacked

the toga of a national crisis started within the domain of University of Ilorin in January 2001', ' Those involved are Academic Staff Union of university (ASUU) - Unilorin branch activists who were battling the then vice-chancellor, Professor S', "" Oba Abdulraheem and the institution's authority over the delay in the payment of salaries, allowances, and other sundry welfare issues"", ' They were vociferous in their demands and the authorities considered them as a clog in the wheel of their plans for the institution', ' In such a conservative environment, the university authority considered such radical demand for rights a taboo', ""  The allegations against the institution's authorities were still on when the parent ASUU commenced a national strike in April 2001"", ' The nationwide university strike was embarked upon against the backdrop of the general rot in universities across the country', ' Problems of poor infrastructure, poor funding, university autonomy, conditions of service for academic staff and academic freedom budgetary allocation were among the demands of ASUU', '  As usual with successive administrations, attempts were made to break the strike', ' In most of the universities, including the University of Ilorin, attendance registers were opened for lecturers who came to work to sign', ' This sent jitters down the spines of most of the lecturers who for fear of losing their jobs rushed to the institution on a daily basis to sign the registers', "" Those of them who believed strongly in the cause of the struggle shunned the register, daring the institution's authority threat to sack those lecturers who defied its order"", '  At the end of the day and consequent upon series of negotiation between the Federal Government and the ASUU leadership, the strike was called off not without an agreement to be implemented by both parties', ' ASUU reportedly ensured the insertion of a “no victimization clause” into the agreement', ' The essence of this was to guarantee that none of its members who partook in the strike would be persecuted because of their involvement', '  However, the University of Nigeria, (UNN), Nsukka and University of Ilorin terminated the appointment of some lecturers perceived to have played prominent roles in ensuring the success of the strike by ASUU', ' UNN authorities after public hues and cries reinstated its sacked lecturers', ' But in Unilorin, its authorities refused to reverse itself', ' 103 lecturers were given sack letters that did not state the reasons behind the decision', 'http://thenationonlineng', 'net/acting-counsel-sacked-49-unilorin-lecturers-like-suicide-mission-olushola-bayeshea-san/   The breakdown of these figures are: 15 professors, two associate professors', ' 15 senior lecturer, 18 lecturers: 40 doctors and 12 medical school lecturers out of which 11 were consultants', '  Consequent upon this sack, the Ayo Banjo-committee was set up to look into the crisis', ' The committee report did not find any of the UNILORIN 49 guilty', "" While several others were re-absorbed into the system, the institution's authorities did not see any wisdom in recalling the UNILORIN 49 lecturers"", ' Afterall, they were seen as a fraction of about 700 lecturers in the university', '  However, among the sacked were deep intellectuals and key functionaries, which led to the stagnation of some classes especially in the medical field which could not graduate students due to the sack of key lecturers', ' Still, some of the lecturers who could not immediately get alternative accommodation were forcefully ejected from their staff quarters', ""  Recourse to litigation: When the University of Ilorin authorities remained recalcitrant in its resolve not to reabsorb the Unilorin 49, several external bodies acting as pressure groups intervened, sometimes pleading with the institution's authorities to reconsider its position"", ' Traditional rulers, Yoruba Council of Elders, National Assembly and Nigeria Inter-religious Council (NIREC), all tried to no avail to bring back peace to Unilorin and the entire university system in the country', ' The Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), the International Labour Organisation (ILO), UNESCO and a coalition of civil society organisations led by the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights (CDHR) also intervened to no avail', '  At this point, five of the Unilorin 49, led by Dr', ' Taiwo Oloruntoba-Oju, approached the Federal High Court, Ilorin to seek redress on behalf of their other colleagues', '  Precisely on July 26, 2005, the Federal High Court, Ilorin under Justice Peter Olayiwola, ruled that the termination of the appointment of the affected lecturers on account of participation in the strike without a fair hearing was “illegal and unconstitutional', '” The termination exercise was declared “null and void:” and the court ordered their earnest reinstatement', '  Nevertheless, the institution exercised its right of appeal when it challenged the judgment at the Court of Appeal', ' On July 12, 2006, the Court of Appeal sitting in Ilorin, Kwara State upturned the judgment of the Federal High Court by declaring that the university was in order by sacking the 49 lecturers', ' Out of the three Justices that sat over the case, two Justices, Muntaka Coomasie and T', ' Abdullahi ruled against the lecturers while Justice Helen Ogunwumiju ruled in favour of the lecturers', '  The Court of Appeal ruled that the lecturers should have taken their case to the National Industrial Court being a trade dispute matter as Union leaders: that the lecturers were not sacked for their role in the strike: that since the lecturers were not sacked for any offense, the issue of fair hearing did not arise', "" At another point, the court upheld the university's claim that the lecturers were given an opportunity for fair hearing while observing in another part that the lecturers were not sacked for any offense"", '  The judgment of the Court of Appeal was challenged by the lecturers at the Supreme Court', ""  After about eight years and 10 months of a tortuous legal battle, the 44 sacked lecturers of the University of Ilorin (UNILORIN) in Kwara State were ordered to be reinstated by Nigeria's Supreme Court on December 11, 2009"", ' The apex court ordered their immediate reinstatement and the payment of all their entitlements from February 2001, the date of their illegal disengagement, to date', ' The 5 UNILORIN ASUU leaders had earlier had their sack reversed by the same Supreme Court on June 12, 2009', '  This was reported to be the basis of the two decade - long feud between the University of Ilorin Chapter of the ASUU and the National Headquarters of the Union', ' Until

concealed canal and drowned', ' The explosion and its aftermath are believed to have killed at least 1,100 people and displaced over 20,000, with many thousands injured or homeless', ' The government of Nigeria launched an enquiry, which blamed the Nigerian Army for failing to properly maintain the base, or to decommission it when instructed to do so in 2001', '  Explosion Ikeja Cantonment was a large Nigerian Army living and storage area in the city of Lagos, situated north of the city centre near the districts of Isolo and Onigbongo', ' In January 2002, the base was being used to store a large quantity of ""high calibre bombs"", as well as other sundry explosives', ' On the afternoon of 27 January, a fire broke out in a street market being held next to the base, which was also home to the families of soldiers', "" At around 18:00 the fire apparently spread to the base's main munitions store, causing an enormous explosion"", ' This blast killed many of the base staff and their families and immediately destroyed several nearby streets, flying debris starting numerous fires further afield', ' Tremors from the explosion also collapsed many buildings in the area, trapping people in the ruins and starting new fires from damaged cooking appliances', ' These tremors were so powerful that windows shattered 15\xa0km away and the blast could be felt more than 50\xa0km inland', '  Also thrown up by the blast were thousands of as yet unexploded military munitions, which fell in a rain of exploding shells, grenades and bullets casting further destruction across most of the northern section of the city', ' Thousands of people from Ikeja and neighbouring districts, seeing explosions and fires breaking out, fled their houses in an attempt to leave the affected areas', ' As the streets became more and more crowded, explosions amid the fleeing crowds from shells falling from the initial explosion created panic', ' A stampede developed as panicking people fled in all directions, trampling those who fell underfoot', ' Reports also describe people jumping from burning high-rise buildings and being killed in desperate attempts to cross the busy Ikeja dual

that at least 1,000 bodies were recovered and a number of people were reported missing and never found', ' In addition to the dead, at least 5,000 people were injured in the disaster and over 12,000

huge ammunition dump was kept in such a poorly maintained and public location', ' It later emerged that a small explosion had occurred at the base the previous year, following which the army was advised by city officials to remove or modernise the armoury, but took no action', ' On the evening of 28 January, George Emdin, the commander of the Ikeja base who had not been present during the

to improve the storage facility, but this accident happened before the high authorities could do what was needed""  This statement provoked fury from the people of Lagos, who claimed that the military was making excuses for their mistakes and that nothing would be done to improve safety at other neglected ammunition dumps, many of which have not been properly maintained since Nigeria gained democracy in 1999 following twenty years of military rule', ' There were widespread fears in the immediate aftermath of the explosion that it signified the beginning of a military coup, although the government later released a statement ruling out this possibility', '  Numerous relief agencies, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent, provided aid to the thousands of homeless and lost people in the weeks following the disaster, attempting to reunite at least 2,000 separated or displaced families', ' People whose homes had survived were evacuated from Ikeja in order that military explosives

NG-2018-7Z-00000086,"['Odo Ere, popularly called Ere Gajo, is the headquarters of Yagba West Local Government Area, Kogi State, Nigeria', ' The town is located in the old Kabba Province about 140 kilometres southeast of Ilorin', ' The people of Odo Ere share a common ancestry with the Yoruba people in South-West Nigeria and they are often referred to as Okun Yoruba people', ' The town is situated on a well-watered savannah plain consisting of dotted hills, forest and grassland', ' The topography earned the town the sobriquet: Ere Ọmọ Onilẹ Dun Rin, meaning ""Odo Ere town with a beautiful flat terrain that enhances ease of movement""', '  Origins Odo Ere has a heritage dating back some centuries', ' The people of Odo Ere and their kin at Akata Ere and Oke Ere, who are collectively called Ere people, migrated from the old Oyo Kingdom', ' The founder of Ere was an old woman, who was believed to be a beautiful princess from the royal family in the Old Oyo Kingdom', ' She migrated with some people to settle at Akata more than five centuries ago', ' The princess who left Old Oyo with her people to settle at Akata was generally and popularly called Iya Agba (i', 'e', ' the old woman) from where the Yagba people derived their name and dialect', ' From the oral history account, Iyekolo stated that Iya Agba had three male children; the oldest boy remained at Akata with his mother, the younger boy migrated to build a settlement at Ẹgbẹ, while the youngest boy migrated to develop a settlement at Eri', ' It was believed that the oldest brother, who lived with his mother at Akata, created two settlements called Odo Oko Ere (i', 'e', ' the lower settlement), which metamorphosed to the modern-day Odo Ere town and the Oke Oko Ere (i', 'e', ' the upper settlement), which became the current Oke Ere town respectively', ' The people of Odo Ere are Yoruba people like the Yagba and entire Okun people, who are one of the Yoruba sub-ethnic groups that occupy the most North-eastern part of Yoruba land', ' The political and religious systems of the people of Odo Ere have the same in common with the rest of Okun-Yoruba people as documented by ethnoarchaeological scholars  After settling at Akata for a long time, there was a gradual expansion in the population as it was a trade route connecting Katunga, the capital of the Old Oyo Kingdom with Kano and North Africa around 1700', ' The way of life of the Odo Ere people followed that of the Yoruba people as exemplified by their dialect, culture, tradition, names, folklore, norms and values that bear substantial affinity and semblance to Yoruba people in South-West Nigeria', ' Odo Ere consists of four Aku (i', 'e', ' clans) called Isaba clan, Ibaru clan, Oke Aga clan and Ipa clan', ' Each of the four clans is semi-autonomous with a democratic council of chiefs like other clans in Okunland under a unified and democratic socio-political leadership of the Elere of Ere', '  Local capital Yagba West Local Government Area in Kogi State is located in the Kogi West Senatorial District along the Western region of the State where it adjoins with Kwara State on the latitude of 8,15N and 5,33E with a total land area of 11,276\xa0km', ' Based on the 2006 Census population figure, Yagba West Local Government Area has a population of 139,928 people then, which has been projected to 188,900 in 2016 by the National Population Commission of Nigeria', ' The eight communities that constitute Yagba West Local Government are traditionally called Akumejo meaning eight communities as recognised by Kwara State in 1982', ' From the popular oral history of West Yagba people, the historian Bolaji Iyekolo confirmed that Odo Ere is the oldest town among the eight communities that make up Yagba West Local Government', ' This fact was stated in 1995 by Chief Olatunji Simoyan in his book, Egbe Chronicles', '  In a Letter of Appreciation addressed to the former military President of Nigeria, General Ibrahim Babangida, by the Ere Welfare Association dated 29 October 1991 commending the General Babangida for siting the headquarters of Yagba West Local Government in Odo Ere, Ere Welfare Association categorically declared that Odo Ere is the earliest settlement in West Yagba accepted by the entire people of Yagba in Kogi State', ' This letter was contained on pages 46 to 51 in the book, The Making of Ere, authored by the historian Chief Bolagi Iyekolo', ' This fact was further substantiated with the British Colonial Government Memo dated 21 June 1930 in which the British Colonial Officer, Captain W', 'J', ' Warren stated that the traditional meeting place of all the people of West Yagba District had been at Okutadudu in Odo Ere', ' The eight communities consist of Ere, Ẹgbẹ, Okeri, Ọgga, Odo Eri, Ogbe, Ejiba and Okoloke', ' Given the fact that Odo Ere is acknowledged as the oldest town in Yagba West, it became de jure headquarters', ' Prior to the coming of the Europeans, Odo Ere was the headquarters and the meeting place of Akumejo people', '  During the colonial era beginning from the 1890s, Odo Ere was designated as the headquarters of West Yagba District by the British colonial government', ' Odo Ere was duly acknowledged as the headquarters of West Yagba District in 1900 by the British authorities in the Ilorin Province', ' Also, the town was recognized as the headquarters of West Yagba District by the representatives of the British colonial administration such as the District Officer, Pategi-Lafiaji Division in 1933, the District Officer of Kabba Province in 1934 and the District Officer, Pategi-Lafiaji Division in 1934 respectively in their reports', ' When the Yagba Native Authority, comprising the West Yagba and East Yagba Districts, was created in 1934 Odo Ere was designated the headquarters of West Yagba District', ' Before 1934, the British administration separated the Yagba people under two broad administrative divisions consisting of West Yagba under the Pategi-Lafiagi Division and East Yagba under Kabba Division', "" Following Governor Donald Cameron's reform of Lord Lugard's indirect rule in Nigeria between 1931 and 1935, he corrected the anomalies of separating people with similar socio-cultural affinity in different administrative systems"", ' Moreover, Governor Cameron suspended the idea of imposing a system of administration on a group of people without conducting prior investigations and consultations with them to identify the form of the native administration system that would best serve their interest', ' Against this background, the British colonial administration commissioned A', 'R Bailey, the Assistant District Officer of Pategi-Lafiagi Division, to conduct inquiries with the Yagba people on the integration of West Yagba and East Yagba under the Kabba Province and the nature of the native administration that would suit them', ' Following the fusion of West Yagba and East Yagba into the Kabba Province, Odo Ere was further designated as the headquarters of West Yagba', ' By 1938, West Yagba District had set up an elected Council as the preferred form of government that was best suited to their socio-political needs and aspirations', ' Furthermore, Iyekolo asserted that during the introduction of the autonomous regional government by the British administration in Nigeria between 1954 and 1960, the Edict of the Northern Nigeria Government of 1958 recognised Odo Ere as the headquarters of West Yagba District', '  Under the administration of General Yakubu Gowon between 1966 and 1975, Colonel David Bamigboye, the then Governor of Kwara State, reaffirmed Odo Ere as the headquarters of Yagba West Local Government Area', '  In 1975, the government of Colonel Ibrahim Taiwo, the then Governor of Kwara State, reasserted Odo Ere as the headquarters of West Yagba', '  Additionally, during the Second Republic in 1982, the administration of Adamu Atta, the then civilian Governor of Kwara State, revalidated Odo-Ere as the headquarters of West Yagba when it was made the headquarters of Akumejo Local Government Area', '  More importantly, the government of General Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida reinstated Odo Ere as the headquarters of Yagba West Local Government Area when he created new nine states and many local government areas on 27 August 1991', '  Traditional political structure  Odo Ere is governed by a hierarchy of traditional political institutions', ' There are three major strata of traditional, political leadership structures in Ere consisting of the Elere (i', 'e', ' the Ọba of Ere), the Baale (the head of chiefs) and the Council of Chiefs consistent with the political tradition in many towns and cities in the Yoruba heartland', ' At the top of the hierarchical structure of leadership is the paramount ruler called Elere of Ere (i', 'e', ' the Ọba or the King of Ere), who is the equivalent of Ọba or King in Yoruba tradition practiced in Ile Ife and Oyo', ' The traditional political system in Ere is led by the Elere of Ere', ' Before the coming of the British colonial administration, Elere of Ere was duly recognised as the highest political leader in Ere During the arrival of the British colonial government, Elere of Ere was acknowledged as the apex authority over the Ere people', '  The Elere is the monarchical head of the traditional government and institutions in Odo Ere land', ' Between 1861 and 1895, the reign of Elere Ogbamanu was prominent, and the colonial Government gave him a staff of office in 1900 in recognition of his authority', ' According to the Assistant Resident District Officer, Pategi-Lafiagi Division, in 1931 the Elere of Ere was the first District Head of West Yagba placed on a monthly salary of £1:18', '5 and he was the highest-paid traditional ruler among his peers', ' The Elere maintains law and order in the town; he administers the affairs of the people and promotes peace and prosperity in the land', ' Under the 1916 Native Authority Ordinance promulgated by Frederick Lugard, a traditional ruler such as Elere of Ere, Baale of Ere or a Chief was empowered by the colonial government to maintain law, order and peace in their domain', ' Moreover, in the 1914 Native Court Ordinance enacted by Frederick Lugard, a court consisting of some native judges headed by the traditional ruler such as Elere holding court sessions to administer customary laws and try minor offences and crimes', ' Therefore, with the implementation of the Native Court Ordinance 1914 and the Native Authority Ordinance enacted by the Lugard colonial administration, the two Ordinances conferred some administrative, judicial, including political and economic responsibilities upon an Oba and a Baale, including Elere of Ere and Baale of Ere in 1914', ' After Sir Donald Cameron replaced Sir Frederick Lugard, in 1933 he introduced four major legislations that had some far-reaching implications on traditional political institutions in Odo Ere', "" With the implementation of the Sir Donald Cameron administration's Native Courts (Protectorate) Ordinance of 1933 and Native Authorities Ordinance of 1933, there was a reform of the traditional administration of law and justice in West Yagba District; the responsibilities of maintaining law and order, including the collection of taxes, and other functions fell on the shoulders of Elere"", '  The Elere of Ere is assisted by many chiefs appointed by him to carry out some delegated functions in the administration of the town as it is practiced in the traditional political system among Okun-Yoruba people', ' However, the throne of Elere of Ere is not necessarily hereditary as there are some towns in Yoruba land whose Obaship is not hereditary', ' Odo Ere people operate a non-hereditary Obaship similar to the Ibadan and Abeokuta kingdoms that used to practice an equalitarian style of appointment of Oba to provide for more upward mobility for its citizens', ' Odo Ere does not operate the dynastic kingdom leadership style that characterised the socio-political organisation that is common among some cities and towns in central Yorubaland, especially Ile Ife', '  Given the fact that Odo Ere is one of the towns that make up the Okun-Yoruba people in Kogi State, the people of Odo Ere practice a non-hereditary kingship system popular among the Okun people which is rotated among clans unlike in cities such as Ile-Ife, Oyo, and others that operate hereditary monarchical ruling families', ' Whenever it is the turn of Odo Ere to produce the Elere of Ere, the throne of Elere is usually rotated between the Isaba, Oke Aga, Ibaru and Ipa clans', ' These four clans further consisted of ten wards called Akata, Isaba, Gbẹdẹ, Oke Aga, Ibaru, Ọkẹtẹ, Ipa, Iloe, Ayinaro and Odo Wẹrẹ', ' Nevertheless, the title of Elere of Ere is mainly rotational between Odo Ere and Oke Ere towns; whenever the Elere title rotates to either of the two towns, it would rotate to the next clan in waiting', ' Moreover, when the Elere of Ere goes to meet his ancestors, the title will rotate to the next town waiting in line', ' The rotation of Elere of Ere has been done peacefully between Odo Ere and Oke Ere without a major fuss because they are from the same source: they are children of Iya Agba that settled at Akata more than four centuries ago', '  The second in the hierarchy is the Baalẹ of Ere (i', 'e', ' the deputy of Elere of Ere), who is next in authority to the Elere of Ere', ' When an Elere of Ere passes to meet his ancestors, the Baalẹ of Ere may probably be appointed to succeed the Elere of Ere or the people of Odo Ere may choose a new person to ascend the throne of Elere', ' In Yorubaland, the Baalẹ makes rules and regulations in conjunction with the Elere, and the Baalẹ implements them in association with the Council of Chiefs (Igbimo) and the compound heads (Olori Adugbo) assist him in his jurisdiction', ' The Baalẹ of Ere conducts regular deliberations with Elere and maintains law and order in the town; he administers the affairs of the people, promotes peace, prosperity and well-being of the people in the town', ' In Yorubaland, the Baalẹ maintains law and order and tries minor cases in his domain', ' The Baalẹ of Ere maintains laws and orders, tries minor cases, and appoints some chiefs to assist him in carrying out some delegated functions to ensure the smooth running of the administration of the town having been empowered alongside Elere of Ere by the colonial government under the Native Courts Ordinances of 1914 and 1933 and the Native Authorities Ordinances of 1916 and 1933', ' Like the Elere of Ere, the Baalẹ of Ere is rotational between Odo Ere and Oke Ere, but the rotation is consequent upon the demise of an Elere of Ere', ' Nevertheless, the throne of Baalẹ of Ere is not automatically hereditary like the Elere of Ere', '  The third level in the hierarchy is the Council of Traditional Chiefs and the Honorary Chiefs called Igbimo before the coming of the British administration that supports the Elere of Ere or the Baalẹ of Ere in ensuring the smooth administration, development, promotion of peace and well-being of the people of Ere land', ' The traditional chiefs are appointed from the eight wards called Akata, Ọkẹtẹ, Ipa, Iloe, Isaba, Igbẹdẹ, Oke Aga and Ibaru from among the clans and lineages that constitute Odo Ere', ' They are made of successful people with integrity, good education, business skills and knowledge of tradition', ' The honorary chiefs are members of the successful educated and business elite, who are honoured and awarded chieftaincy titles by the Elere of Ere or the Baalẹ of Ere based on their excellent personal achievements, selfless contributions to the development of the town and good reputation', ' Also, the honorary chieftaincy titles are given to indigenes of Odo Ere, who have brought outstanding honour, glory and valuable contributions to the town through their personal commitment, dedication and patriotism to Ere community as it is practiced throughout Yorubaland', ' All the chiefs in Odo Ere, regardless of their statuses and functions, work harmoniously in assisting the Elere or the Baalẹ of Ere in rendering valuable services towards the upliftment, peace, progress and improvement of the community', ' The Elere or the Baalẹ of Ere may decide in consultation with his chiefs to give honorary chieftaincy titles to worthy non-indigenes, who have made positive contributions to the development of Odo Ere', '  Besides the above elaborate political structure, Odo Ere has the basic socio-political unit called Idile (i', 'e', ' the family unit)', ' In Odo Ere and in Yorubaland, Idile constitutes the smallest political unit', ' Atanda argues that the Yoruba people evolved a basic socio-political organisation in the course of their development called ẹbi or idile, which is the lineage system', ' Idile, the family unit in Odo Ere, is a dynamic system that has expanded exponentially due to population growth in the town', ' Additionally, as the family units in Odo Ere grew, more family units developed, which metamorphosed into Ẹbi (i', 'e', ' extended family) in all the clans, and they usually live in spatially defined areas like family compounds in Odo Ere', ' The Ẹbi members called Ọmo̩ Ẹbi or Ọmo̩ Ẹlẹbi (i', 'e', ' extended family members) shared the same ancestral lineage in Odo Ere like the ẹbi in the central Yorubaland', ' Given the expansion of the extended family members, some Ẹbi members have moved out of the family compounds to build their separate modern houses or settlements within the town', ' Each family lineage in Odo Ere has a family head usually the oldest man called Olori Ẹbi', ' The olori ẹbi in Odo Ere does not operate as an autocratic leader, and he is not a paramount ruler', ' Olori Ẹbi provides leadership in consultation with the older men and women members of the extended family', ' In some situations, the olori ẹbi, who is the embodiment of the cultural norms, may be a titled chief in the town, and he may not necessarily be a titled chief', '   Economy and agriculture  The economic activities of Odo Ere are primarily based on agriculture, craft, trade, business and the civil service system', ' As far back as 1912 during the colonial administration, the people of Odo Ere and Yagba people had established trade relations with Nupe and Hausa traders', ' During this period, Odo Ere people traded with Pategi people', ' Local traders in Odo Ere travelled to Nupe to sell kola nuts, palm oil and native clothes', ' Many of the men in Odo Ere are traditionally peasant farmers and hunters', ' Some of them practise various arts and crafts such as carpentry, blacksmithing,  carving, weaving, and leatherworking in a similar way to men in central Yorubaland in Nigeria', ' Others are involved in furniture making, fashion designing, plumbing, bricklaying, building, painting and others', ' Some of the upper and middle-class men invested in businesses such as hospitality, petroleum, education, transportation, timber logging and trading', ' The majority of the women are reputed for practising arts and crafts such as bead making, basket making, cloth weaving, and rope making', ' Others practice mat making, cloth dying, pot making, calabash decoration, cap making such as their fellow Yoruba women in South West, Nigeria', '  Women engage in trading in goods and production of gari and elubọ among others', ' Some upper class and middle-class women invested in supermarket, restaurants and cafeteria selling good and nutritious foods with drinks and others', ' Also, many of the educated men and women living in the town are civil servants working in the state and the local government institutions and departments', '  The people in Odo Ere practice three types of farming systems (a) farming system that is practiced near the town (oko etile), (b) farming system that is practiced far away from the town in which the farmers return to the town on a daily basis (oko), and (c) farming system that is practiced at extremely distant farmlands that are far away from the town where the farmers live on the farm for days, weeks or months before returning to the town (oko ni waju)', ' These three types of the farming systems in the town correspond with the three types practiced in the Yoruba heartland in South West, Nigeria', '  a', ' Food crops  Some of the food crops planted in Odo Ere are aerial yam (i', 'e', ' Dioscorea Bulbifera), banana and plantain, beans, cocoyam (i', 'e', ' Colocasia Esculentum), cassava, water yam (i', 'e', ' Dioscorea Alata), maize, white yam (i', 'e', ' Dioscorea Rotundata), sorghum, sweet potato, rice, yellow yam (i', 'e', ' Dioscorea Cayenensis) and others', '  Additionally, farmers in Odo Ere grow a variety of yams called ajimokun, ọgọdọyọ, elemsu, ekunmọ, ewura, including sagbẹ, agga, oodo, ẹẹsin, kẹrẹgẹ, kampi, efee, ẹwasiko, esuru, koko (cocoyam), emnna, gangan, aagbii, areyin, paki-onisu, among others', '  b', ' Vegetables  Among the vegetables planted in the town used for soup making are okro, spinach, ẹfo tẹtẹ (African spinach), ẹfo sọkọ (green vegetable), ẹfọ gbure (waterleaf), ewuro (bitter leaf), amunututu (waterleaf), ewedu (jute), igi oshe, and igi dẹrẹ', ' The above mentioned food items and vegetables found in Odo Ere are used to prepare different sumptuous meals and delicacies which are equally common in Yagbaland', '  c', ' Fruits  The fruits grown in Odo Ere include tomato, banana, orange, mango, pineapples, pepper, melon, pawpaw, cashew, grape, lime, guava, coconuts, almond, ackee (called isin in Yagba dialect), tangerine, garden eggs and many others', '  d', ' Livestock  Also, livestock farming is practiced to a limited extent by the people', ' Men and women tend goats, sheep, poultry and pigs', ' Some breed dogs for commercial purposes, while others breed snail and others', '  e', ' Cash crops  Some of the cash crops grown in Odo Ere are cocoa, coffee, cotton, groundnut (peanut), millet, oil palm, and cashew nuts, among others', ' These cash crops produced in Odo Ere are common agricultural commodities produced in Yagbaland, Okunland, Yorubaland, and some parts of Nigeria', ' Moreover, during the British colonial rule, the agents of the Royal Niger Company prospected for cash crops such as coffee, cashew nuts, cotton, groundnut, palm kernel and others in the town', '  It is important to stress the processing of cassava, maize, yam, sorghum and banana into varieties of flours (elubọ) which serves as a form of small-scale business that provides a significant source of income for women and food for the people in the community', '  It must be emphasised that the success of the agricultural economy in Odo Ere in the production of food crops, vegetables, cash crops, and fruits discussed above rests on the presence of some rivers and streams that provide water for farming, plants and animals in the town', ' Some of the major rivers that made agricultural practice and small-scale irrigation of farmland possible in the town are River Lawiri, River Oofi, River Iya, River Onfun and River Igboran', ' Essentially, River Lawiri derives its source from Oke Ere; its freshwater flows across the streambed between banks through Akata Ere, which serves as its middle course and down to Odo Ere, which is its lower course where it facilitates agricultural production, farm irrigation and production of fruits in Lawiri area along the Odo Ere-Ilorin road axis', ' At this point along Odo Ere-Ilorin road, Lawiri River takes its course down by passing under the Lawiri bridge flowing to the right-hand section of the town where it provides abundant water supply to aid large farming system in Lawiri farm settlements more than 7 kilometres from the Odo Ere town centre', '  Additionally, River Oofi flows through Odo Ere land providing fresh water to promote farming, domestic use and it eventually connects to Oyi River to boost farm irrigation at Omi dam where Kogi State and Yagba West Local Government are expanding rice production, and job opportunities for the citizens of Odo Ere, Yagba West and Kogi State, among others', ' Also, the freshwater of River Iya flows through Odo Ere; according to Bolaji Iyekolo on page 5 of the book The Making of Ere, he stated that the river partitioned the town into areas called Kege Iya (upper settlement) and Ikọja Iya (lower settlement) respectively along Odo Ere-Kabba road, where it provides water for agricultural production and domestic utilities', ' Furthermore, some of the streams that provide fresh water for subsistence agricultural practices in Odo Ere are Aso, Gọdọgbọ, Ibu Iyawo, Etimkan, Omugbogbo, Turuku and Omi Ọpẹ that aid farmers specialising in Oko Etile in the production of Shea butter, locust beans, vegetable, maize, yam, beans, sorghum, cassava, and fruits such as cashew, mango and orange, which Odo Ere farmers commonly produced like the Yagba peasant farmers', '  Markets  There are four major markets in the mainland of Odo Ere called Ọja Yagba, Ọja Ọpẹ, Ọja Ọba and Ọja Oke while there is Ojere market in Akata Ere; commercial and economic activities in these markets are dominated by women and conducted periodically such as every three-day, weekly or daily, and they represent prominent locations of economic and social activities in the town', ' Markets in Odo Ere ensure people fulfil their demand and supply needs; they perform the economic functions of food supply, local exchange of resources, internal trade system and facilitate consumption', ' The markets in Odo Ere set the socio-economic rhythms for the regulation of circulation and convergence of the people in the town and some neighbouring towns to have place-time inter-relationships for the exchange of goods and services', ' These markets are conducted in open locations in the town which is common in Nigeria, where people regularly gather for the exchange of goods for sale and purchase of food items, clothing materials, jewellery, shoes and other goods', ' Also, the people sell consumer products, imported foods and goods, vegetables, dried fish and meat, live goats and chickens, frozen chickens, fish and meat, fruits, books and stationery, and household goods, among others', ' However, a few decades ago, Ọja Ọba used to have some market stalls', ' These markets are often patronised by people from Okunland in Kogi State, including people from towns and local governments in Kwara State', '  One crucial characteristic of markets in Odo Ere is the excitement of the haggling system of a price negotiation between the sellers and buyers of products to ensure both parties mutually agree on a fair price prior to the exchange of goods', ' The process of haggling by women and men in the market in Nigeria involves a situation where the seller and the buyer of a product make a sequential offer and counter-offer to each other until they mutually agree on a price', ' This exchange situation occurs when the person trying to buy a product is negotiating to pay the least amount possible, while the person selling the product is trying to maximize the selling price', ' From observation, women perfect the art of haggling system better than men in the markets', ' Women in Odo Ere utilise markets as a business institution to promote their economic activities and ensure social security', ' Markets play some crucial functions in the economic life of the people of Odo Ere', ' They help promote commodity distribution and consumption, facilitate the exchange of resources and strengthen the economic and financial base of a town', ' Also, they provide sources of taxation for the Yagba West Local Government', '  Culture  The people of Odo Ere have distinctive cultural

substantial affinity and semblance to Yoruba people in South-West Nigeria', ' Odo Ere consists of four Aku (i', 'e', ' clans) called Isaba clan, Ibaru clan, Oke Aga clan and Ipa clan', ' Each of the four clans is semi-autonomous with a democratic council of chiefs like other clans in Okunland under a unified and democratic socio-political leadership of the Elere of Ere', '  Local capital Yagba West Local Government Area in Kogi State is located in the Kogi West Senatorial District along the Western region of the State where it adjoins with Kwara State on the latitude of 8,15N and 5,33E with a total land area of 11,276\xa0km', ' Based on the 2006 Census population figure, Yagba West Local Government Area has a population of 139,928 people then, which has been projected to 188,900 in 2016 by the National Population Commission of Nigeria', ' The eight communities that constitute Yagba West Local Government are traditionally called Akumejo meaning eight communities as recognised by Kwara State in 1982', ' From the popular oral history of West Yagba people, the historian Bolaji Iyekolo confirmed that Odo Ere is the oldest town among the eight communities that make up Yagba West Local Government', ' This fact was stated in 1995 by Chief Olatunji Simoyan in his book, Egbe Chronicles', '  In a Letter of Appreciation addressed to the former military President of Nigeria, General Ibrahim Babangida, by the Ere Welfare Association dated 29 October 1991 commending the General Babangida for siting the headquarters of Yagba West Local Government in Odo Ere, Ere Welfare Association categorically declared that Odo Ere is the earliest settlement in West Yagba accepted by the entire people of Yagba in Kogi State', ' This letter was contained on pages 46 to 51 in the book, The Making of Ere, authored by the historian Chief Bolagi Iyekolo', ' This fact was further substantiated with the British Colonial Government Memo dated 21 June 1930 in which the British Colonial Officer, Captain W', 'J', ' Warren stated that the traditional meeting place of all the people of West Yagba District had been at Okutadudu in Odo Ere', ' The eight communities consist of Ere, Ẹgbẹ, Okeri, Ọgga, Odo Eri, Ogbe, Ejiba and Okoloke', ' Given the fact that Odo Ere is acknowledged as the oldest town in Yagba West, it became de jure headquarters', ' Prior to the coming of the Europeans, Odo Ere was the headquarters and the meeting place of Akumejo people', '  During the colonial era beginning from the 1890s, Odo Ere was designated as the headquarters of West Yagba District by the British colonial government', ' Odo Ere was duly acknowledged as the headquarters of West Yagba District in 1900 by the British authorities in the Ilorin Province', ' Also, the town was recognized as the headquarters of West Yagba District by the representatives of the British colonial administration such as the District Officer, Pategi-Lafiaji Division in 1933, the District Officer of Kabba Province in 1934 and the District Officer, Pategi-Lafiaji Division in 1934 respectively in their reports', ' When the Yagba Native Authority, comprising the West Yagba and East Yagba Districts, was created in 1934 Odo Ere was designated the headquarters of West Yagba District', ' Before 1934, the British administration separated the Yagba people under two broad administrative divisions consisting of West Yagba under the Pategi-Lafiagi Division and East Yagba under Kabba Division', "" Following Governor Donald Cameron's reform of Lord Lugard's indirect rule in Nigeria between 1931 and 1935, he corrected the anomalies of separating people with similar socio-cultural affinity in different administrative systems"", ' Moreover, Governor Cameron suspended the idea of imposing a system of administration on a group of people without conducting prior investigations and consultations with them to identify the form of the native administration system that would best serve their interest', ' Against this background, the British colonial administration commissioned A', 'R Bailey, the Assistant District Officer of Pategi-Lafiagi Division, to conduct inquiries with the Yagba people on the integration of West Yagba and East Yagba under the Kabba Province and the nature of the native administration that would suit them', ' Following the fusion of West Yagba and East Yagba into the Kabba Province, Odo Ere was further designated as the headquarters of West Yagba', ' By 1938, West Yagba District had set up an elected Council as the preferred form of government that was best suited to their socio-political needs and aspirations', ' Furthermore, Iyekolo asserted that during the introduction of the autonomous regional government by the British administration in Nigeria between 1954 and 1960, the Edict of the Northern Nigeria Government of 1958 recognised Odo Ere as the headquarters of West Yagba District', '  Under the administration of General Yakubu Gowon between 1966 and 1975, Colonel David Bamigboye, the then Governor of Kwara State, reaffirmed Odo Ere as the headquarters of Yagba West Local Government Area', '  In 1975, the government of Colonel Ibrahim Taiwo, the then Governor of Kwara State, reasserted Odo Ere as the headquarters of West Yagba', '  Additionally, during the Second Republic in 1982, the administration of Adamu Atta, the then civilian Governor of Kwara State, revalidated Odo-Ere as the headquarters of West Yagba when it was made the headquarters of Akumejo Local Government Area', '  More importantly, the government of General Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida reinstated Odo Ere as the headquarters of Yagba West Local Government Area when he created new nine states and many local government areas on 27 August 1991', '  Traditional political structure  Odo Ere is governed by a hierarchy of traditional political institutions', ' There are three major strata of traditional, political leadership structures in Ere consisting of the Elere (i', 'e', ' the Ọba of Ere), the Baale (the head of chiefs) and the Council of Chiefs consistent with the political tradition in many towns and cities in the Yoruba heartland', ' At the top of the hierarchical structure of leadership is the paramount ruler called Elere of Ere (i', 'e', ' the Ọba or the King of Ere), who is the equivalent of Ọba or King in Yoruba tradition practiced in Ile Ife and Oyo', ' The traditional political system in Ere is led by the Elere of Ere', ' Before the coming of the British colonial administration, Elere of Ere was duly recognised as the highest political leader in Ere During the arrival of the British colonial government, Elere of Ere was acknowledged as the apex authority over the Ere people', '  The Elere is the monarchical head of the traditional government and institutions in Odo Ere land', ' Between 1861 and 1895, the reign of Elere Ogbamanu was prominent, and the colonial Government gave him a staff of office in 1900 in recognition of his authority', ' According to the Assistant Resident District Officer, Pategi-Lafiagi Division, in 1931 the Elere of Ere was the first District Head of West Yagba placed on a monthly salary of £1:18', '5 and he was the highest-paid traditional ruler among his peers', ' The Elere maintains law and order in the town; he administers the affairs of the people and promotes peace and prosperity in the land', ' Under the 1916 Native Authority Ordinance promulgated by Frederick Lugard, a traditional ruler such as Elere of Ere, Baale of Ere or a Chief was empowered by the colonial government to maintain law, order and peace in their domain', ' Moreover, in the 1914 Native Court Ordinance enacted by Frederick Lugard, a court consisting of some native judges headed by the traditional ruler such as Elere holding court sessions to administer customary laws and try minor offences and crimes', ' Therefore, with the implementation of the Native Court Ordinance 1914 and the Native Authority Ordinance enacted by the Lugard colonial administration, the two Ordinances conferred some administrative, judicial, including political and economic responsibilities upon an Oba and a Baale, including Elere of Ere and Baale of Ere in 1914', ' After Sir Donald Cameron replaced Sir Frederick Lugard, in 1933 he introduced four major legislations that had some far-reaching implications on traditional political institutions in Odo Ere', "" With the implementation of the Sir Donald Cameron administration's Native Courts (Protectorate) Ordinance of 1933 and Native Authorities Ordinance of 1933, there was a reform of the traditional administration of law and justice in West Yagba District; the responsibilities of maintaining law and order, including the collection of taxes, and other functions fell on the shoulders of Elere"", '  The Elere of Ere is assisted by many chiefs appointed by him to carry out some delegated functions in the administration of the town as it is practiced in the traditional political system among Okun-Yoruba people', ' However, the throne of Elere of Ere is not necessarily hereditary as there are some towns in Yoruba land whose Obaship is not hereditary', ' Odo Ere people operate a non-hereditary Obaship similar to the Ibadan and Abeokuta kingdoms that used to practice an equalitarian style of appointment of Oba to provide for more upward mobility for its citizens', ' Odo Ere does not operate the dynastic kingdom leadership style that characterised the socio-political organisation that is common among some cities and towns in central Yorubaland, especially Ile Ife', '  Given the fact that Odo Ere is one of the towns that make up the Okun-Yoruba people in Kogi State, the people of Odo Ere practice a non-hereditary kingship system popular among the Okun people which is rotated among clans unlike in cities such as Ile-Ife, Oyo, and others that operate hereditary monarchical ruling families', ' Whenever it is the turn of Odo Ere to produce the Elere of Ere, the throne of Elere is usually rotated between the Isaba, Oke Aga, Ibaru and Ipa clans', ' These four clans further consisted of ten wards called Akata, Isaba, Gbẹdẹ, Oke Aga, Ibaru, Ọkẹtẹ, Ipa, Iloe, Ayinaro and Odo Wẹrẹ', ' Nevertheless, the title of Elere of Ere is mainly rotational between Odo Ere and Oke Ere towns; whenever the Elere title rotates to either of the two towns, it would rotate to the next clan in waiting', ' Moreover, when the Elere of Ere goes to meet his ancestors, the title will rotate to the next town waiting in line', ' The rotation of Elere of Ere has been done peacefully between Odo Ere and Oke Ere without a major fuss because they are from the same source: they are children of Iya Agba that settled at Akata more than four centuries ago', '  The second in the hierarchy is the Baalẹ of Ere (i', 'e', ' the deputy of Elere of Ere), who is next in authority to the Elere of Ere', ' When an Elere of Ere passes to meet his ancestors, the Baalẹ of Ere may probably be appointed to succeed the Elere of Ere or the people of Odo Ere may choose a new person to ascend the throne of Elere', ' In Yorubaland, the Baalẹ makes rules and regulations in conjunction with the Elere, and the Baalẹ implements them in association with the Council of Chiefs (Igbimo) and the compound heads (Olori Adugbo) assist him in his jurisdiction', ' The Baalẹ of Ere conducts regular deliberations with Elere and maintains law and order in the town; he administers the affairs of the people, promotes peace, prosperity and well-being of the people in the town', ' In Yorubaland, the Baalẹ maintains law and order and tries minor cases in his domain', ' The Baalẹ of Ere maintains laws and orders, tries minor cases, and appoints some chiefs to assist him in carrying out some delegated functions to ensure the smooth running of the administration of the town having been empowered alongside Elere of Ere by the colonial government under the Native Courts Ordinances of 1914 and 1933 and the Native Authorities Ordinances of 1916 and 1933', ' Like the Elere of Ere, the Baalẹ of Ere is rotational between Odo Ere and Oke Ere, but the rotation is consequent upon the demise of an Elere of Ere', ' Nevertheless, the throne of Baalẹ of Ere is not automatically hereditary like the Elere of Ere', '  The third level in the hierarchy is the Council of Traditional Chiefs and the Honorary Chiefs called Igbimo before the coming of the British administration that supports the Elere of Ere or the Baalẹ of Ere in ensuring the smooth administration, development, promotion of peace and well-being of the people of Ere land', ' The traditional chiefs are appointed from the eight wards called Akata, Ọkẹtẹ, Ipa, Iloe, Isaba, Igbẹdẹ, Oke Aga and Ibaru from among the clans and lineages that constitute Odo Ere', ' They are made of successful people with integrity, good education, business skills and knowledge of tradition', ' The honorary chiefs are members of the successful educated and business elite, who are honoured and awarded chieftaincy titles by the Elere of Ere or the Baalẹ of Ere based on their excellent personal achievements, selfless contributions to the development of the town and good reputation', ' Also, the honorary chieftaincy titles are given to indigenes of Odo Ere, who have brought outstanding honour, glory and valuable contributions to the town through their personal commitment, dedication and patriotism to Ere community as it is practiced throughout Yorubaland', ' All the chiefs in Odo Ere, regardless of their statuses and functions, work harmoniously in assisting the Elere or the Baalẹ of Ere in rendering valuable services towards the upliftment, peace, progress and improvement of the community', ' The Elere or the Baalẹ of Ere may decide in consultation with his chiefs to give honorary chieftaincy titles to worthy non-indigenes, who have made positive contributions to the development of Odo Ere', '  Besides the above elaborate political structure, Odo Ere has the basic socio-political unit called Idile (i', 'e', ' the family unit)', ' In Odo Ere and in Yorubaland, Idile constitutes the smallest political unit', ' Atanda argues that the Yoruba people evolved a basic socio-political organisation in the course of their development called ẹbi or idile, which is the lineage system', ' Idile, the family unit in Odo Ere, is a dynamic system that has expanded exponentially due to population growth in the town', ' Additionally, as the family units in Odo Ere grew, more family units developed, which metamorphosed into Ẹbi (i', 'e', ' extended family) in all the clans, and they usually live in spatially defined areas like family compounds in Odo Ere', ' The Ẹbi members called Ọmo̩ Ẹbi or Ọmo̩ Ẹlẹbi (i', 'e', ' extended family members) shared the same ancestral lineage in Odo Ere like the ẹbi in the central Yorubaland', ' Given the expansion of the extended family members, some Ẹbi members have moved out of the family compounds to build their separate modern houses or settlements within the town', ' Each family lineage in Odo Ere has a family head usually the oldest man called Olori Ẹbi', ' The olori ẹbi in Odo Ere does not operate as an autocratic leader, and he is not a paramount ruler', ' Olori Ẹbi provides leadership in consultation with the older men and women members of the extended family', ' In some situations, the olori ẹbi, who is the embodiment of the cultural norms, may be a titled chief in the town, and he may not necessarily be a titled chief', '   Economy and agriculture  The economic activities of Odo Ere are primarily based on agriculture, craft, trade, business and the civil service system', ' As far back as 1912 during the colonial administration, the people of Odo Ere and Yagba people had established trade relations with Nupe and Hausa traders', ' During this period, Odo Ere people traded with Pategi people', ' Local traders in Odo Ere travelled to Nupe to sell kola nuts, palm oil and native clothes', ' Many of the men in Odo Ere are traditionally peasant farmers and hunters', ' Some of them practise various arts and crafts such as carpentry, blacksmithing,  carving, weaving, and leatherworking in a similar way to men in central Yorubaland in Nigeria', ' Others are involved in furniture making, fashion designing, plumbing, bricklaying, building, painting and others', ' Some of the upper and middle-class men invested in businesses such as hospitality, petroleum, education, transportation, timber logging and trading', ' The majority of the women are reputed for practising arts and crafts such as bead making, basket making, cloth weaving, and rope making', ' Others practice mat making, cloth dying, pot making, calabash decoration, cap making such as their fellow Yoruba women in South West, Nigeria', '  Women engage in trading in goods and production of gari and elubọ among others', ' Some upper class and middle-class women invested in supermarket, restaurants and cafeteria selling good and nutritious foods with drinks and others', ' Also, many of the educated men and women living in the town are civil servants working in the state and the local government institutions and departments', '  The people in Odo Ere practice three types of farming systems (a) farming system that is practiced near the town (oko etile), (b) farming system that is practiced far away from the town in which the farmers return to the town on a daily basis (oko), and (c) farming system that is practiced at extremely distant farmlands that are far away from the town where the farmers live on the farm for days, weeks or months before returning to the town (oko ni waju)', ' These three types of the farming systems in the town correspond with the three types practiced in the Yoruba heartland in South West, Nigeria', '  a', ' Food crops  Some of the food crops planted in Odo Ere are aerial yam (i', 'e', ' Dioscorea Bulbifera), banana and plantain, beans, cocoyam (i', 'e', ' Colocasia Esculentum), cassava, water yam (i', 'e', ' Dioscorea Alata), maize, white yam (i', 'e', ' Dioscorea Rotundata), sorghum, sweet potato, rice, yellow yam (i', 'e', ' Dioscorea Cayenensis) and others', '  Additionally, farmers in Odo Ere grow a variety of yams called ajimokun, ọgọdọyọ, elemsu, ekunmọ, ewura, including sagbẹ, agga, oodo, ẹẹsin, kẹrẹgẹ, kampi, efee, ẹwasiko, esuru, koko (cocoyam), emnna, gangan, aagbii, areyin, paki-onisu, among others', '  b', ' Vegetables  Among the vegetables planted in the town used for soup making are okro, spinach, ẹfo tẹtẹ (African spinach), ẹfo sọkọ (green vegetable), ẹfọ gbure (waterleaf), ewuro (bitter leaf), amunututu (waterleaf), ewedu (jute), igi oshe, and igi dẹrẹ', ' The above mentioned food items and vegetables found in Odo Ere are used to prepare different sumptuous meals and delicacies which are equally common in Yagbaland', '  c', ' Fruits  The fruits grown in Odo Ere include tomato, banana, orange, mango, pineapples, pepper, melon, pawpaw, cashew, grape, lime, guava, coconuts, almond, ackee (called isin in Yagba dialect), tangerine, garden eggs and many others', '  d', ' Livestock  Also, livestock farming is practiced to a limited extent by the people', ' Men and women tend goats, sheep, poultry and pigs', ' Some breed dogs for commercial purposes, while others breed snail and others', '  e', ' Cash crops  Some of the cash crops grown in Odo Ere are cocoa, coffee, cotton, groundnut (peanut), millet, oil palm, and cashew nuts, among others', ' These cash crops produced in Odo Ere are common agricultural commodities produced in Yagbaland, Okunland, Yorubaland, and some parts of Nigeria', ' Moreover, during the British colonial rule, the agents of the Royal Niger Company prospected for cash crops such as coffee, cashew nuts, cotton, groundnut, palm kernel and others in the town', '  It is important to stress the processing of cassava, maize, yam, sorghum and banana into varieties of flours (elubọ) which serves as a form of small-scale business that provides a significant source of income for women and food for the people in the community', '  It must be emphasised that the success of the agricultural economy in Odo Ere in the production of food crops, vegetables, cash crops, and fruits discussed above rests on the presence of some rivers and streams that provide water for farming, plants and animals in the town', ' Some of the major rivers that made agricultural practice and small-scale irrigation of farmland possible in the town are River Lawiri, River Oofi, River Iya, River Onfun and River Igboran', ' Essentially, River Lawiri derives its source from Oke Ere; its freshwater flows across the streambed between banks through Akata Ere, which serves as its middle course and down to Odo Ere, which is its lower course where it facilitates agricultural production, farm irrigation and production of fruits in Lawiri area along the Odo Ere-Ilorin road axis', ' At this point along Odo Ere-Ilorin road, Lawiri River takes its course down by passing under the Lawiri bridge flowing to the right-hand section of the town where it provides abundant water supply to aid large farming system in Lawiri farm settlements more than 7 kilometres from the Odo Ere town centre', '  Additionally, River Oofi flows through Odo Ere land providing fresh water to promote farming, domestic use and it eventually connects to Oyi River to boost farm irrigation at Omi dam where Kogi State and Yagba West Local Government are expanding rice production, and job opportunities for the citizens of Odo Ere, Yagba West and Kogi State, among others', ' Also, the freshwater of River Iya flows through Odo Ere; according to Bolaji Iyekolo on page 5 of the book The Making of Ere, he stated that the river partitioned the town into areas called Kege Iya (upper settlement) and Ikọja Iya (lower settlement) respectively along Odo Ere-Kabba road, where it provides water for agricultural production and domestic utilities', ' Furthermore, some of the streams that provide fresh water for subsistence agricultural practices in Odo Ere are Aso, Gọdọgbọ, Ibu Iyawo, Etimkan, Omugbogbo, Turuku and Omi Ọpẹ that aid farmers specialising in Oko Etile in the production of Shea butter, locust beans, vegetable, maize, yam, beans, sorghum, cassava, and fruits such as cashew, mango and orange, which Odo Ere farmers commonly produced like the Yagba peasant farmers', '  Markets  There are four major markets in the mainland of Odo Ere called Ọja Yagba, Ọja Ọpẹ, Ọja Ọba and Ọja Oke while there is Ojere market in Akata Ere; commercial and economic activities in these markets are dominated by women and conducted periodically such as every three-day, weekly or daily, and they represent prominent locations of economic and social activities in the town', ' Markets in Odo Ere ensure people fulfil their demand and supply needs; they perform the economic functions of food supply, local exchange of resources, internal trade system and facilitate consumption', ' The markets in Odo Ere set the socio-economic rhythms for the regulation of circulation and convergence of the people in the town and some neighbouring towns to have place-time inter-relationships for the exchange of goods and services', ' These markets are conducted in open locations in the town which is common in Nigeria, where people regularly gather for the exchange of goods for sale and purchase of food items, clothing materials, jewellery, shoes and other goods', ' Also, the people sell consumer products, imported foods and goods, vegetables, dried fish and meat, live goats and chickens, frozen chickens, fish and meat, fruits, books and stationery, and household goods, among others', ' However, a few decades ago, Ọja Ọba used to have some market stalls', ' These markets are often patronised by people from Okunland in Kogi State, including people from towns and local governments in Kwara State', '  One crucial characteristic of markets in Odo Ere is the excitement of the haggling system of a price negotiation between the sellers and buyers of products to ensure both parties mutually agree on a fair price prior to the exchange of goods', ' The process of haggling by women and men in the market in Nigeria involves a situation where the seller and the buyer of a product make a sequential offer and counter-offer to each other until they mutually agree on a price', ' This exchange situation occurs when the person trying to buy a product is negotiating to pay the least amount possible, while the person selling the product is trying to maximize the selling price', ' From observation, women perfect the art of haggling system better than men in the markets', ' Women in Odo Ere utilise markets as a business institution to promote their economic activities and ensure social security', ' Markets play some crucial functions in the economic life of the people of Odo Ere', ' They help promote commodity distribution and consumption, facilitate the exchange of resources and strengthen the economic and financial base of a town', ' Also, they provide sources of taxation for the Yagba West Local Government', '  Culture  The people of Odo Ere have distinctive cultural norms and values:  Language The people of Odo Ere speak Yagba dialect, which shares a linguistic affinity with the Yoruba language spoken and written in South West, Nigeria', ' The Yagba dialect spoken and written by the people of Odo Ere consisted of the same alphabets as the Yoruba language', ' The Yagba dialect, as a form of the Yoruba language, is a tonal language that has three major tones called high, mid and low tones', ' The Yagba dialect spoken by Odo Ere possesses the same characteristics as the Yoruba language', ' It consists of a set of communicative signals, sound symbols, phonological and grammatical systems, and vocal sounds', ' It is conventional, creative, productive, and dynamic', ' Odo Ere has many rich proverbs, folklore and legends', ' The people use figurative speech in their daily conversations and communication to express antithesis, apostrophe, euphemism, hyperbole, metonymy, irony, anaphora, litotes, metaphor, onomatopoeia, paradox, antithesis, oxymoron, simile, personification, pun, understatement and others, rendered in resonant Yagba dialect', '  Arts, crafts and trade In Odo Ere both men and women engage in different forms of arts, crafts and trade as sources of economy', ' The cultural arts and crafts commonly practiced in Odo Ere include bead making, basket making, cloth weaving, rope making, mat making, cloth dying, pot making, calabash decoration, cap making, pestle and mortar making, blacksmithing and others', ' The arts and crafts bear equivalent attributes and manifest identical creative characteristics as those produced in Yorubaland, particularly in Oyo Empire and Ile Ife', ' Odo Ere women are very industrious individuals who engage in businesses involving arts, crafts and trade', ' Many of them practise weaving of different clothes such as Asọ Ofi popularly called Asọ-Oke, Kente and many others', ' They weave different colours of Asọ-Oke such as ‘‘ẹtù’’ (navy blue), ‘àlàárì’ (rich maroon), and ‘sányán’ (light brown with some creamy stripes)', ' Following the arts and crafts usually done by women in the central Yorubaland, a good number of older women in Odo Ere are involved in pottery', ' They make both small and medium-size pots for cooking and big size pots for reserving water', ' Others practise bead making, hair braiding, basket making, cloth weaving, rope making, mat making, cloth dying, fashion design, and hairstyling among others', ' Many of them are into petty trading and small-medium scale businesses', ' Additionally, following the tradition of art and crafts by men in Yorubaland, some older men in Odo Ere practise cap making, rope making, pestle and mortar making, and mat making; others are involved in bricklaying, shoe mending, carpentry, goldsmithing, furniture making, fashion designing and painting', ' Some practise blacksmithing through which they produce hoes and cutlasses for agricultural purposes, together with knives, traps, local hunting guns, and many other implements', ' Also, a substantial proportion of them is into petty trading and small-medium scale businesses', '  Dress Odo Ere people use assorted traditional and modern styles of dressing for different occasions and events such as a wedding, naming, birthday, burial and other social outings', ' The dressing styles for men are different from women, even when they use the same fabrics to make them', "" Among the dresses worn by men are buba, agbada, gbariyẹ, dandogo (upper dresses), ilarun (hunter's shoulder sleeve), dansiki, including sokoto, kẹmbẹ, sọọrọ, gbamu, kamu, ibantẹ (trouser-like designs) and fila, onide, gọbi, abeti-aja, tinko, alagbaa, oribi and others (caps)"", ' They may be made of the same fabrics or specially made from asọ oke or ofi which can be in different colours such as àlàárì (rich maroon),ẹtu (navy blue) and sányán (light brown with some creamy stripes), and other colours to make exquisite aesthetic designs', ' Odo Ere women have beautiful cultural dresses such as ọmọnijogun (wedding dress), iro (wrapper), buba (blouse–type loose top), iborun (shoulder shawl), tobi (skirt/underwear), ipele (long shoulder dress), sinmi (sleeveless T-shirt), gele (head tie), yẹri (skirt/underwear), aran, and tanpapa, which they wear during wedding, including naming and burial ceremonies and festivals', ' Some of the traditional fabrics used to design dresses in Odo Ere include asọ oke, ofi, adirẹ, batiks, sányán, kente or other traditional fabrics', ' Also, they wear them during the wedding, naming and burial ceremonies, including during different religious festivals', ' Both men and women use modern fabrics and fashion design machines to make exquisite, gorgeous, flashy, glamorous and immaculate dresses', ' Apart from the above mentioned traditional clothes, men in Odo Ere wear European styles of clothes such as shirts, trousers, suits, while women wear blouses, skirts, suits, gowns among others', ' All these dresses are sewn using various types of clothing materials', ' Additionally, the people of Odo Ere love excellent colours, fabrics and designs of the different types of dresses mentioned above; they may combine or mix many of the primary and secondary colours in sewing their dresses', ' Others may be designed using a single colour such as blue, green, white, including red, yellow, and other colours that are commonly used by their kith and kin in Okunlan and the central Yorubaland in South-West Nigeria', '  Traditional and modern jewellery Jewellery used by the people of Odo Ere consists of small decorative ornaments worn for personal adornment by women and men such as bracelets, earrings, rings and necklaces among others', ' People in the town are very glamorous in dressing by adorning different types of exotic beads to showcase belief system, fashion trends, royalty and wealth as it is richly done among the Yoruba people', ' Odo Ere women wear traditional jewellery such as yẹti (earrings), ilẹkẹdi (waist beads), ilẹkẹ ọwọ (wrist beads), ilẹkẹ ọrun (neck beads), including iyun, akun and lagidigba (royal beads for kings and chiefs) as their fellow Yoruba people', ' In the modern time, they use exotic ornaments such as oruka (rings), ẹgba ọrun, (necklaces), ẹgba ẹsẹ (anklets), and ẹgba ọwọ (bangles)  made of gold, silver, diamonds and other gemstones', ' Also, men use rings, necklaces and bangles', ' However, the use of anklets for social adornment is not common among women and men in Odo Ere', ' Nevertheless, the adherents of indigenous religion such as the worshippers of Orisa and Sango deities may use anklets during their festivals', '  Facialograph and body scarification In the olden days, the beautification of the face using facialographs (facial marks)  for aesthetic and cultural identity and the scarification of the body were practiced among the people of Odo Ere, but the tradition has become extinct in the town', ' The use of facialographic marks in Odo Ere is part of the rich Yoruba beautification and cultural identification marks often inscribed on the face or cheeks by burning or cutting of the skin using local blades or specially made small knives', ' In the olden days, there were specialist facial markers who practiced the occupation by charging fees', ' In Odo Ere, the specialist facial markers were called Oloola in the olden days; they usually shave the heads and beards (if a male adult) of their clients prior to inscribing the facial marks of their choosing', ' In many cases, facialographic marks are conducted when the clients (male and female) are young children; in fewer instances, they are done when the clients are young adults', ' Importantly, Johnson attested to the use of facial marks among Yagba people (in which Odo Ere people are part of) when he declared that the Yagba people in the North-easterly part of Nigeria are sub-ethnic groups of the Yoruba, who are distinguishable by their long tribal marks on each cheek and usually meeting at an angle of the mouth', ' In the distant past, men and women used facial marks for beautification and identification of their specific family, clan and lineage', '  Moreover, women in Odo Ere used facial and body scarification to make aesthetic and appealing designs to beautify their bodies, particularly making stylish and artistic designs on their faces, tummies, legs, thighs, arms, hips and wrists', ' Body scarification as a means of beautification and identification in Odo Ere, in the olden days, was similar to the modern-day tattoo', ' It is possible that the practice of using facial marks and body scarification must have been eliminated in Odo Ere about 100 years ago due to modernisation as someone might see such marks on the faces or the bodies of elderly men and women in their 80 and 90 years old in the town today', ' However, some of the facial marks used in Odo Ere in the past by our forebears included pele (i', 'e', ' pele Ifẹ, pele Ijẹbu), abaja (i', 'e', ' abaja-ẹgba, abaja-owu, abaja-mẹrin), kẹkẹ (i', 'e', ' kẹkẹ owu), and gọmbọ popularly used by the Yoruba people in the central Yorubaland', ' Other Yoruba facialographic marks commonly used for beautification in the central Yorubaland in South West, included bamu, jamgbadi, mande and ture but they might not be very popular among our ancestors in Odo

large quantity of ""high calibre bombs"", as well as other sundry explosives', ' On the afternoon of 27 January, a fire broke out in a street market being held next to the base, which was also home to

inland', '  Also thrown up by the blast were thousands of as yet unexploded military munitions, which fell in a rain of exploding shells, grenades and bullets casting further destruction across most of the northern section of the city', ' Thousands of people from Ikeja and neighbouring districts, seeing explosions and fires breaking out, fled their houses in an attempt to leave the affected

advised by city officials to remove or modernise the armoury, but took no action', ' On the evening of 28 January, George Emdin, the commander of the Ikeja base who had not been present during the

was making excuses for their mistakes and that nothing would be done to improve safety at other neglected ammunition dumps, many of which have not been properly maintained since Nigeria gained democracy in 1999 following twenty years of military rule', ' There were widespread fears in the immediate aftermath of the explosion that it signified the beginning of a military coup, although the government later released a statement ruling out this possibility', '  Numerous relief agencies, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent, provided aid to the thousands of homeless and lost people in the weeks following the disaster, attempting to reunite at least 2,000 separated or displaced families', ' People whose homes had survived were evacuated from Ikeja in order that military explosives

Wukari became the regional power in the 1840s after the once-powerful Kwararafa state had been destroyed during the Fulani jihad (1804–1810) and its aftermath', ' The consolidation of Wukari as an independent state may have been given impetus by pressure from the Chamba people, who were pushing westward down the Benue at that time', '  When the British incorporated the state into the protectorate of Nigeria around 1900, it was multi-ethnic, including Tiv and Moslem Hausa-Fulani people as well as the original Jukun', ' The British delegated much authority to traditional rulers in

kingship, with the Aku Uka being considered son of a god', ' Of several gods, the sun god is paramount', ' The religion includes belief in communicating with the souls of the dead', '  These similarities to Egyptian beliefs have led some anthropologists to speculate that the Jukun originally came from Sudan', ' The Kuteb people, who speak a related language and live just to the south of
