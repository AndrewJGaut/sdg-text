The restoration of democracy and subsequent economic reforms have successfully put Nigeria back on track towards achieving its full economic potential. During the oil boom of the 1970s, Nigeria accumulated a significant foreign debt to finance major infrastructural investments. Nigeria used part of its oil profits to pay the residual 40%, freeing up at least $1.15 billion annually for poverty reduction programmes.

It is a lower-middle-income economy, with its abundant supply of natural resources, well-developed financial, legal, communications, transport sectors and Nigerian Stock Exchange. The restoration of democracy and subsequent economic reforms have successfully put Nigeria back on track towards achieving its full economic potential. During the oil boom of the 1970s, Nigeria accumulated a significant foreign debt to finance major infrastructural investments. Nigeria used part of its oil profits to pay the residual 40%, freeing up at least $1.15 billion annually for poverty reduction programmes. Nigeria made history in April 2006 by becoming the first African country to completely pay off its debt (estimated $30 billion) owed to the Paris Club. This contrasts with the sixteen largest fields which produced 37.9% of Nigeria's petroleum at that time.Nigeria: The Political Economy of Oil  (Khan, Ahmad)  In addition to its petroleum resources, Nigeria also has a wide array of underexploited mineral resources which include natural gas, coal, bauxite, tantalite, gold, tin, iron ore, limestone, niobium, lead and zinc.
