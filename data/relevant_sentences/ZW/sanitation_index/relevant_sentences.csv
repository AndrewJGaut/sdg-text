ZW-2010-6#-00000130,2.0,"Until recently, groundwater wells were used to meet about 80% of demand for water. In the South African portion of the basin, water usage exceeds the potential water yield from the basin by 800,000,000 cubic metres (650,000 acre-feet) annually. Morupule Colliery uses three boreholes for water, but takes water from the NSC when needed through a  pipeline from Palapye. The project included installing the pipeline itself, as well as pumping stations, water treatment plants, storage and balancing reservoirs, measurement and control systems and  infrastructure. The first phase of the project would deliver the water to the Pandamatenga area for agricultural use, and the second phase would carry water from Pandamatenga south to the NSC.

Water resources The water supply for the Honde Valley comprises small piped systems and motorised pumps serving small towns, growth points, commercial plantations, service centres and some villages, as well as direct abstractions from the rivers by riparian village communities not connected to developed installations. There are a total of about seven small to medium-sized metered piped water systems at Hauna, Sachisuko, Honde Army, Zindi, Samanga, Mpotedzi and Sahumani. In addition there are other smaller un-metered water supply schemes that serve a number of villages and schools. The known smaller un-metered water supply schemes are Honde “Povo” Pipe Scheme, Chingaira Piped Scheme, St Columbus Secondary School, Sagambe Primary and Secondary School, Marige Water Project, Mahobo Piped Scheme and Mupenga Gravity Water Scheme.

ZW-2010-6#-00000343,1.0,"Flora The 500 square kilometres of the Honde Valley in Zimbabwe are extensively cultivated, often with gravity fed irrigation channels. Water resources The water supply for the Honde Valley comprises small piped systems and motorised pumps serving small towns, growth points, commercial plantations, service centres and some villages, as well as direct abstractions from the rivers by riparian village communities not connected to developed installations. There are a total of about seven small to medium-sized metered piped water systems at Hauna, Sachisuko, Honde Army, Zindi, Samanga, Mpotedzi and Sahumani. In addition there are other smaller un-metered water supply schemes that serve a number of villages and schools. The known smaller un-metered water supply schemes are Honde “Povo” Pipe Scheme, Chingaira Piped Scheme, St Columbus Secondary School, Sagambe Primary and Secondary School, Marige Water Project, Mahobo Piped Scheme and Mupenga Gravity Water Scheme. However, it is also home to many small scale and subsistence farmers.Green Harvest: The Outgrower Tea Leaf Collection System in the Honde Valley, Zimbabwe J P Mtisi There are several non-motorized irrigation schemes in Honde valley.Working Paper No. Pungwe River – fishing and white water rafting  Nyanga National ParkNyanga National Park."
