alternative name for the country, proposing names such as ""Matshobana"" and ""Monomotapa"" before his suggestion, ""Zimbabwe"", prevailed', ' A further alternative, put forward by nationalists in Matabeleland, had been ""Matopos"", referring to the Matopos Hills to the south of Bulawayo', '  It was initially unclear how the chosen term was to be used—a letter written by Mawema in 1961 refers

1890 to justify sending the Pioneer Column, a group of white settlers protected by well-armed British South Africa Police (BSAP) and guided by the big game hunter Frederick Selous, through Matabeleland and into Shona territory to establish Fort Salisbury (now Harare)', ' In 1893–1894, with the help of their new Maxim guns, the BSAP defeated the Ndebele in the First Matabele War, a war which also resulted in the death of King Lobengula and the death of most of the members of the Shangani Patrol', ' Shortly after the disastrous BSAP Jameson Raid into the Transvaal Republic, the Ndebele were led by their spiritual leader Mlimo against the white colonials and thus began the Second Matabele War (1896–97) which resulted in the extermination of nearly half the British settlers', ' After months of bloodshed, Mlimo was found and shot by the American scout Frederick Russell Burnham and soon thereafter Rhodes walked unarmed into the Ndebele stronghold in Matobo Hills and persuaded the impi to lay down their arms, effectively ending the revolt', ""  A legislative council was created in 1899 to manage the company's civil affairs, with a minority of elected seats, through which the BSAC had to pass government measures"", ' As the company was a British institution in which settlers and capitalists owned most shares, and local black African tribal chiefs the remainder, and the electorate to this council was limited to those shareholders, the electorate was almost exclusively white settlers', ' Over time as more settlers arrived and a growing number had less than the amount of land required to own a share in the company or where in trades supporting the company as workers, successive activism resulted in first increasing the proportion of elected seats, and eventually allowing non-share holders the right to vote in the election', ' Prior to about 1918, the opinion among the electorate supported continued BSAC rule but opinion changed because of the development of the country and increased settlement', ' In addition, a decision in the British courts that land not in private ownership belonged to the British Crown rather than the BSAC gave

settler population', ' The CAF sought to emulate the experience of Australia, Canada and South Africa – wherein groups of colonies had been federated together to form viable independent nations', ' Originally designed to be ""an indissoluble federation"", the CAF quickly started to unravel due to the low proportion of British and other white citizens in relation to the larger black populations', ' Additionally, by incorporating the tribes within the Federation as potential citizens, the Federation created the paradoxical situation of having a white elite owning most of the land and capital,

of these were relatively new to the region, were primarily in the extraction business, had little landed interests, and were more amenable to allowing black nationalism than the Southern Rhodesians', ' Accordingly, Britain granted independence to Northern Rhodesia on 24 October 1964', ' However, when the new nationalists changed its name to Zambia and began tentatively at first and later in rapid march an Africanisation campaign, Southern Rhodesia remained a British colony, resisting attempts to bring in majority rule', ' The colony attempted to change its name to Rhodesia although this was not recognised by the United Kingdom', "" The majority of the Federation's military and financial assets went to Southern Rhodesia, since the British Government did not wish to see them fall into the

the three member states (due to its vast copper mines) and had contributed more to the overall building of infrastructure than the other two members did', ' Southern Rhodesia, recognising an inevitable dissolution of the Federation, was quick to use federal funds in building its infrastructure ahead of the others', ' A key component of this was the building of the Kariba Dam and its hydroelectric facility (shafts, control centre, etc', '), which was situated on the Southern Rhodesian side of the Zambezi Gorge', ' This situation caused some embarrassment for the Zambian government later when it was a ""front line state"" in support of insurgents into Rhodesia in that its major source of electric power was controlled by the Rhodesian state', '  Return to ""Rhodesia""  With the

alternative name for the country, proposing names such as ""Matshobana"" and ""Monomotapa"" before his suggestion, ""Zimbabwe"", prevailed', ' A further alternative, put forward by nationalists in Matabeleland, had been ""Matopos"", referring to the Matopos Hills to the south of Bulawayo', '  It was initially unclear how the chosen term was to be used—a letter written by Mawema in 1961 refers

alternative name for the country, proposing names such as ""Matshobana"" and ""Monomotapa"" before his suggestion, ""Zimbabwe"", prevailed', ' A further alternative, put forward by nationalists in Matabeleland, had been ""Matopos"", referring to the Matopos Hills to the south of Bulawayo', '  It was initially unclear how the chosen term was to be used—a letter written by Mawema in 1961 refers

nine British missionaries and four children at Elim Mission near the Mozambican border in the Vumba massacre on 23 June', '  The transitional government was badly received abroad, partly because the

were still alive', ' This alerted the insurgents to the presence of more survivors; one of the guerrillas told MacLaren\'s group to ""come here""', ' The insurgents then opened fire on their general location, prompting MacLaren and the others to flee', ' Hill and the Hansens also ran; they revealed their positions to the fighters in their haste, but successfully hid themselves behind a ridge', '

shifting public opinion', ' Sibanda asserts that the massacre ""cannot be put beyond"" the Scouts, and also supports Nkomo\'s claim that the Hunyani had been used militarily, suggesting that ZIPRA

1890 to justify sending the Pioneer Column, a group of white settlers protected by well-armed British South Africa Police (BSAP) and guided by the big game hunter Frederick Selous, through Matabeleland and into Shona territory to establish Fort Salisbury (now Harare)', ' In 1893–1894, with the help of their new Maxim guns, the BSAP defeated the Ndebele in the First Matabele War, a war which also resulted in the death of King Lobengula and the death of most of the members of the Shangani Patrol', ' Shortly after the disastrous BSAP Jameson Raid into the Transvaal Republic, the Ndebele were led by their spiritual leader Mlimo against the white colonials and thus began the Second Matabele War (1896–97) which resulted in the extermination of nearly half the British settlers', ' After months of bloodshed, Mlimo was found and shot by the American scout Frederick Russell Burnham and soon thereafter Rhodes walked unarmed into the Ndebele stronghold in Matobo Hills and persuaded the impi to lay down their arms, effectively ending the revolt', ""  A legislative council was created in 1899 to manage the company's civil affairs, with a minority of elected seats, through which the BSAC had to pass government measures"", ' As the company was a British institution in which settlers and capitalists owned most shares, and local black African tribal chiefs the remainder, and the electorate to this council was limited to those shareholders, the electorate was almost exclusively white settlers', ' Over time as more settlers arrived and a growing number had less than the amount of land required to own a share in the company or where in trades supporting the company as workers, successive activism resulted in first increasing the proportion of elected seats, and eventually allowing non-share holders the right to vote in the election', ' Prior to about 1918, the opinion among the electorate supported continued BSAC rule but opinion changed because of the development of the country and increased settlement', ' In addition, a decision in the British courts that land not in private ownership belonged to the British Crown rather than the BSAC gave

settler population', ' The CAF sought to emulate the experience of Australia, Canada and South Africa – wherein groups of colonies had been federated together to form viable independent nations', ' Originally designed to be ""an indissoluble federation"", the CAF quickly started to unravel due to the low proportion of British and other white citizens in relation to the larger black populations', ' Additionally, by incorporating the tribes within the Federation as potential citizens, the Federation created the paradoxical situation of having a white elite owning most of the land and capital, whilst using cheap black labour', '  The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was dissolved on 1 January 1964', ' However, it was expected that only Nyasaland would be let go, whilst the remainder of

of these were relatively new to the region, were primarily in the extraction business, had little landed interests, and were more amenable to allowing black nationalism than the Southern Rhodesians', ' Accordingly, Britain granted independence to Northern Rhodesia on 24 October 1964', ' However, when the new nationalists changed its name to Zambia and began tentatively at first and later in rapid march an Africanisation campaign, Southern Rhodesia remained a British colony, resisting attempts to bring in majority rule', ' The colony attempted to change its name to Rhodesia although this was

the three member states (due to its vast copper mines) and had contributed more to the overall building of infrastructure than the other two members did', ' Southern Rhodesia, recognising an inevitable dissolution of the Federation, was quick to use federal funds in building its infrastructure ahead of the others', ' A key component of this was the building of the Kariba Dam and its hydroelectric facility (shafts, control centre, etc', '), which was situated on the Southern Rhodesian side of the Zambezi Gorge', ' This situation caused some embarrassment for the Zambian government later when it was a ""front line state"" in support of insurgents into Rhodesia in that its major source of electric power was controlled by the Rhodesian state', '  Return to ""Rhodesia""  With the

' Its dramatic last stand, sometimes called ""Wilson\'s Last Stand"", achieved a prominent place in the British public imagination and, subsequently, in Rhodesian history, similarly to events such as the Battle of the Little Bighorn in the United States, the Battle of Shiroyama in Japan, the Battle of the Alamo in Texas, and the Greeks\' last stand at Thermopylae', '  The patrol comprised elements of the Mashonaland Mounted Police and the Bechuanaland Border Police', "" Scouting ahead of Major Patrick Forbes's column attempting the capture of the Matabele King Lobengula (following his flight from his capital Bulawayo a month before), it crossed the Shangani late on 3 December 1893"", "" It moved on Lobengula the next morning, but was ambushed by a host of Matabele riflemen and warriors near the king's wagon"", ' Surrounded and outnumbered about a hundred-fold, the patrol made a last stand as three of its number broke out and rode back to the river to muster reinforcements from Forbes', ' However, the Shangani had risen significantly in flood, and Forbes was himself involved in a skirmish near the southern bank; Wilson and his men therefore remained isolated to the north', ' After fighting to the last cartridge, and killing over ten times their own number, they were annihilated', ""  The patrol's members, particularly Wilson and Captain Henry Borrow, were elevated in death to the status of national heroes, representing endeavour in the face of insurmountable odds"", ' The anniversary of the battle on 4 December 1893 became an annual public holiday in Rhodesia two years later, and was an official non-work day until 1920', ' A historical war film depicting the episode, Shangani Patrol, was produced and released in 1970', ""  Controversy surrounds the breakout before the last stand—which various historians have posited might have actually been desertion—and a box of gold sovereigns, which a Matabele inDuna (leader) later said had been given to two unidentified men from Forbes's rear guard on 2 December, along with a message that Lobengula admitted defeat and wanted the column to stop pursuing him"", ' Two batmen were initially found guilty of accepting the gold, keeping it for themselves and not passing on the message, but the evidence against them was inconclusive and largely circumstantial; the convictions were ultimately overturned', '

1880s, the South African-based businessman and politician Cecil Rhodes envisioned the annexation to the British Empire of a swathe of territory connecting the Cape of Good Hope and Cairo—respectively at the southern and northern tips of Africa—and the concurrent construction of a line of rail linking the two', ' On geopolitical maps, British territories were generally marked in red or pink, so this concept became known as the ""Cape to Cairo red line""', "" In the immediate vicinity of the Cape, this ambition was challenged by the presence of independent states to the north-east of Britain's Cape Colony: the Boer republics, and to the north of these the Kingdom of Matabeleland under Lobengula"", ' Having secured the Rudd Concession on mining rights from King Lobengula on 30 October 1888, Rhodes and his British South Africa Company were granted a royal charter by Queen Victoria in October 1889', "" The company was empowered under this charter to trade with local rulers, form banks, own and manage land, and raise and run a police force: the British South Africa Company's Police, renamed the Mashonaland Mounted Police in 1892"", '  In return for these rights, the company would govern and develop any territory it acquired, while respecting laws enacted by extant African rulers, and upholding free trade within its borders', ' The first settlers referred to their new home as ""Rhodesia"", after Rhodes', ' Though the company made good on most of its pledges, the assent of Lobengula and other native leaders, particularly regarding mining rights, was often evaded, misrepresented or simply ignored', ' It also offended Lobengula by demanding that he stop the customary Matabele raids on the Mashona people who inhabited the white-governed areas', "" Angered by the company's attitude towards his authority, Lobengula made war on the new arrivals and the Mashonas in 1893"", ' Matabele warriors began the wholesale slaughter of Mashonas in the vicinity of Fort Victoria in July that year, and an indaba (tribal conference) organised by Company official Leander Starr Jameson to end the conflict ended with violence, and dispersion by force', ' The First Matabele War had started', '  Company columns rode from Fort Salisbury and Fort Victoria, and combined at Iron Mine Hill, around the centre point of the country, on 16 October 1893', ' Together the force totalled about 700 men, commanded by Major Patrick Forbes, and equipped with five Maxim machine guns', "" Forbes's combined column moved on the Matabele king's capital at Bulawayo, to the south-west"", ' The Matabele army mobilised to prevent Forbes from reaching the city, and twice engaged the column as it approached: on 25 October, 3,500 warriors assaulted the column near the Shangani River', ' Lobengula\'s troops were well-drilled and formidable by pre-colonial African standards, but the company\'s Maxim guns, which had never before been used in battle, far exceeded expectations, according to an eyewitness ""mow[ing] them down literally like grass""', ' By the time the Matabele withdrew, they had suffered around 1,500 fatalities; the company, on the other hand, had lost only four men', "" A week later, on 1 November, 2,000 Matabele riflemen and 4,000 warriors attacked Forbes at Bembezi, about  north-east of Bulawayo, but again they were no match for the crushing firepower of the major's Maxims: about 2,500 more Matabele were killed"", '  Lobengula fled Bulawayo as soon as he heard the news from Bembezi', ' On 3 November 1893, with the column on the outskirts of the city, he and his subjects left, torching the royal town as they went', "" In the resultant conflagration, the city's large store of ivory, gold and other treasure was destroyed, as was its ammunition magazine, which exploded"", ' The flames were still rising when the whites entered the settlement the next day; basing themselves in the ""White Man\'s Camp"" already present, they set about extinguishing the fire which engulfed the town', ' Using a tree to improvise a flagstaff, they hoisted first the Company flag, then the Union flag', "" The reconstruction of Bulawayo began almost as soon as the blaze was out, with a new white-run city rising atop the ruins of Lobengula's former residence"", ' Jameson, who now based himself in Bulawayo, wrote the following letter to the Matabele king on 7 November 1893, in English, Dutch and Zulu:  This letter, carried by John Grootboom, a coloured man from the Cape, reached Lobengula near Shiloh Mission, about  north of Bulawayo', ' The king replied in English:  Jameson did not regard this ambiguity as a proper answer, and impatiently waited for further word from the king', ' After standing by for the specified two days and receiving nothing, he correctly concluded that Lobengula was stalling him, and using the extra time to distance himself from his former capital', "" Jameson therefore made good on his pledge, and called for volunteers; he assembled a host of about 470 men, mixed together from the Mashonaland Mounted Police, the Bechuanaland Border Police, and Raaff's Rangers, an independent unit led by the eponymous Commandant Piet Raaff"", "" This force was placed under Forbes's command, with three Maxim guns attached"", ' Jameson told the major to scout the area between Shiloh and Inyati for spoor, with the ultimate objective of capturing Lobengula, and sent him out just before sunset on 14 November 1893', ""  Prelude: Forbes's pursuit of Lobengula thumb|Route of the Shangani Patrol The column left Bulawayo heading north, and, in an attempt to expedite its progress, reorganised itself into a more compact 290-man force at Shiloh"", ' Lobengula, meanwhile, rode north towards the Shangani in his wagon, which left obvious tracks in its wake', "" Following the wagon tracks, Forbes's men were soon hot on the trail, routinely finding recently abandoned Matabele camps, provisions and stragglers"", ' Heavy rain slowed both the king and his pursuers, and led Forbes to split his force again; moving on with a flying column of 160 men, he sent the rest back with the wagons', ' He pushed on, and on 3 December 1893 reached the southern bank of the Shangani, from where he could clearly see Matabele hastily driving cattle behind an impi (regiment) of warriors', ' The presence of smouldering fires beside the native column betrayed the fact that they had just crossed', ' Wishing to know whether the king had crossed here or at another point on the river, Forbes sent Major Allan Wilson across to scout ahead with 12 men and eight officers, and told him to return by nightfall', '  Meanwhile, Forbes formed a laager (improvised fort) about  from the southern bank', ' There, he interrogated a captive Matabele, the son of an inDuna (tribal leader), who said that the king was indeed where Wilson had gone, and was ill (the exact ailment was not known for sure, the prisoner said, but was suspected to be gout)', ' The inDunas son said that Lobengula had with him a force of about 3,000 warriors, about half of whom were armed with Martini–Henry rifles', "" They were mixed together from various regiments of the previously routed Matabele army, and largely demoralised, but still fiercely determined to prevent Lobengula's capture"", "" Most prominent were the Imbezu, Ingubo and Insukameni Regiments; the Imbezu, Lobengula's favourite, was generally considered the strongest"", "" After three weeks in pursuit of the king, Forbes's rations were running perilously short"", ' He therefore resolved to attack the next day (4 December), hoping to be able to turn back for Bulawayo with Lobengula in custody before nightfall', ""  Wilson's men remained north of the river far longer than expected, and had still not returned when darkness fell"", "" Forbes, meanwhile, received a report that most of Lobengula's force, commanded by inDuna Mjaan, had separated from the king and was moving to attack the laager the same night (this was actually an exaggeration; only about 300 riflemen had split from the main Matabele force, though they were indeed south of the river, undetected by Forbes)"", ' Visibility was poor by now, and rain periodically fell', "" The laager received no word from Wilson until about 21:00, when Sergeant-Major Judge and Corporal Ebbage arrived from across the river to tell Forbes that Wilson had found Lobengula's tracks, and followed him for "", ' Wilson regarded the chances of taking the king alive as so good that he was going to remain north of the river overnight', ' He asked Forbes to send more men and a Maxim gun in the morning, but did not explain what he planned to do with them', '  The Shangani Patrol continued its approach during the late evening, and scouted close to the bush enclosure housing Lobengula', ' Captain William Napier repeatedly called to the king in the Matabele language, Sindebele, but received no reply from the Matabele leaders, who remained silent and hid themselves', "" The patrol's actions confused the Matabele, who could not understand why there appeared to be so few Company soldiers, nor why they would reveal their position like this"", "" They concluded that it must be a trap, and were only satisfied that it was not when Wilson's men had stopped during their approach to call to Lobengula five times"", ' Following the fifth call from Napier, Mjaan ordered his riflemen to gather around the patrol, intending to pocket it', ' Noticing this, Wilson ordered a retreat, and took up a well-covered position in the bush where he could hide until daybreak', ' When Lieutenant Hofmeyer and Troopers Bradburn and Colquhoun were lost amid the increasingly stormy night, Wilson briefly backtracked to recover them', '  On returning to his bush camp, Wilson sent a further message to the laager, which reached its destination at around 23:00: Napier, Scout Bain and Trooper Robertson were the men acting as runners', ' Wilson repeated that he was going to stay north of the river overnight, close to the king, and asked Forbes to bring the whole column across by 04:00 in the morning', ' Forbes thought it unwise to attempt a full river crossing at night, which he reasoned might lead to his force being surrounded in the darkness and massacred, but also felt he could not recall Wilson, as to do so would be to lose Lobengula for sure', '  As a compromise, Forbes sent Captain Henry Borrow across with 21 men at 01:00 on 4 December, and told Borrow to relay to Wilson that the laager was surrounded, and ""expected to be attacked any moment""', "" Forbes apparently intended for Borrow's reinforcements to secure Wilson's position, but historian W\xa0D Gale writes that this was a serious tactical error on Forbes's part: the addition of Borrow's men made Wilson's patrol too large to be a mere reconnoitring force, but still too small to overpower the Matabele and capture the king"", "" Indeed, Wilson and his officers looked on gloomily when Borrow's men arrived soon after dawn, fewer in number than expected and without the requested Maxim gun"", ' Only 20 of the reinforcements (including Borrow himself) reached Wilson—Troopers Landsberg and Nesbitt became separated from the main group along the way, and eventually rejoined Forbes during the morning', ' Trooper Robertson returned to Wilson with Borrow, giving the patrol a total of 37 men, including its officers', '  Engagement  Matabele ambushes on both sides of the river [[File:Shangani patrol map',

optimistic about their prospects: ""This is the end"" said one', ' British soldier and historian Roger Marston postulates that the patrol might still have been safe had it not now pursued the king, but Wilson decided to proceed: ""Let\'s ride on Lobengula,"" he said', ' Several analysts comment that this was perhaps excessively rash', ' Marston says that Wilson\'s actions ""had a flavour of doomed resignation about them"", and suggests that the major believed no other path was open, and was therefore going for broke', ' The Matabele hovered around the vicinity, waiting to see what Wilson would do next', "" On the southern side of the river, the 300 Matabele riflemen took up a well-covered position near the riverbank, about  to the left of Forbes's position"", ' Hidden by a patch of scrub, they remained undetected by the Company troops', ""  Wilson, Borrow and the 35 others made for Lobengula's enclosure"", "" The king's wagon was still there, but when Wilson called to him, there was no answer"", ' The king had moved on during the night', ' At that moment, the troopers heard the sound of rifles being cocked in the wood surrounding them', ' A Matabele inDuna stepped out from behind a tree and announced that the enclosure was surrounded by thousands of Matabele who wanted to ""see if the white men were afraid to die', '"" He then fired his rifle to signal the start of the attack to his men', ' A volley from the Matabele riflemen followed, but most of the shots went too high; no Company trooper was hit', "" The only casualties of this opening volley were two of the patrol's horses"", ' Wilson immediately ordered his men to fall back, first to an antheap, then to a thick wood', ' Three of them were wounded during this retreat, but none fatally', '  Hearing the shots from the northern side of the river, Forbes uneasily moved towards the southern bank, intending to cross and help Wilson', "" However, Forbes's fears of an ambush proved to be well-founded; at an opportune moment, the Matabele in the scrub opened fire, catching the column in the open"", "";  The ambushers' shots were initially wild and inaccurate, but they soon began to focus their fire on the exposed Maxim guns and horses, forcing the troopers to retreat to cover"", ' Five Company soldiers were injured', ' The resulting skirmish lasted about an hour, by which time the Shangani had been severely swollen by heavy rains upstream, causing it to flood', '  Meanwhile, Wilson marched his officers and men back towards the river, hoping to reunite with Forbes', ' They moved on for about , but soon noticed that a line of Matabele warriors was blocking their way to the river', ' Wilson refused to sacrifice his wounded by attempting to break through', ' In an act of desperation, he instead sent three of his men—American scouts Frederick Russell Burnham and Pearl ""Pete"" Ingram, and Australian Trooper William Gooding—to charge through the Matabele line, cross the river and bring reinforcements back to help, while he, Borrow and the rest made a last stand', ' Burnham, Ingram and Gooding broke through while the Matabele closed in on the surrounded patrol from a distance, and began to fire on it from cover, killing several of its men', ' After a while, Mjaan ordered his men to charge forward and finish them off, but the Matabele soon fell back, having taken about 40 fatalities', '  Burnham, Ingram and Gooding reached the Shangani about 08:00, but quickly saw that the water had risen far too high for Forbes to provide any assistance', ' Realising the futility of turning back to Wilson without help, they decided to rejoin Forbes anyway, and to that end traversed the swollen river with considerable difficulty', ' They then rode to where the battle on the southern side was still going on', ' On reaching the main column shaken and out of breath, Burnham leapt from his horse and ran to Forbes: ""I think I may say that we are the sole survivors of that

used their dead horses for cover, and killed more than ten times their own number (about 500, Mjaan estimated), but were steadily whittled down as the overwhelming Matabele force closed in from all sides', ' The Company soldiers continued fighting even when grievously wounded, to the astonishment of the Matabele, who thought the whites must be bewitched: ""These are not men but magicians,"" said one Matabele inDuna', '  Late in the afternoon, after hours of fighting, Wilson\'s men ran out of ammunition, and reacted to this by rising to their feet, shaking each other\'s hands and singing a song, possibly ""God Save the Queen""', ' The Matabele downed their own rifles and ended the battle charging with assegai spears', ' Some of the whites allegedly used their last bullets to commit suicide', ' According to an eyewitness, ""the white inDuna"" (Wilson) was the last to die, standing motionless before the Matabele with blood streaming from wounds all over his body', ' After a few moments of hesitation, a young warrior ran forward and killed him with his assegai', ' The Matabele usually mutilated the bodies of their foes after a victory, but on this occasion they did not: ""The white men died so bravely we would not treat them as we do the cowardly Mashonas and others,"" an inDuna explained', "" At Mjaan's orders, the bodies of the patrol were left untouched, though the

southern side of the Shangani was over, Forbes and his column conducted a cursory search for survivors from Wilson's party, but, unable to cross the river, could see nothing to tell them what had happened"", ' Guessing (correctly) that all Company men beyond the river had been killed, they turned and trekked back to Bulawayo in miserable fashion, their supplies all but gone and the Matabele impeding their progress at every turn', '  Matabele raiding parties attacked the retreating column six times during its two-week journey back to Bulawayo', ' In pouring rain, the dishevelled men were soon mostly on foot, existing off horse meat and wearing makeshift shoes made from ammunition wallets', ' Forbes felt so humiliated by the events that he retreated from command in all but name, surrendering de facto control to Commandant Raaff', ' In leading the column back to Bulawayo, Raaff repeatedly drew on his experience from the Anglo-Zulu War to ensure the survival of the haggard men', ' He avoided several Matabele ambushes, and at one point set up a convincing decoy camp that the Matabele fired on for half a day, wasting much of their ammunition', ""  On the column's inglorious return to Bulawayo on 18 December 1893, Forbes was received in muted disgrace"", ' The officers and men stood on parade for Cecil Rhodes, and the Company chief passed the major without a word', "" Raaff, on the other hand, was publicly commended by Rhodes, and thanked for ensuring the column's safe return"", ""  Meanwhile, Lobengula moved to the north-east, now well out of the company's reach for the foreseeable future"", ' However, his sickness, which turned out to be smallpox, sharply intensified and eventually killed him on 22 or 23 January 1894', ' With the king dead, Mjaan, the most senior of the izinDuna, took command of the Matabele', ' Mjaan was an old man, and his only son had been killed in the war', ' He wished to make peace', ' In late February 1894, he convened an indaba at which he and his contemporaries met with James Dawson, a trader known to them for many years, who offered the olive branch on behalf of the company', ' The izinDuna unanimously accepted', ' They also told the trader what had happened to the Shangani Patrol, and led him to the battle site to survey it, as well as to examine and identify the largely skeletonised bodies of the soldiers, which still lay where they had fallen', ' Dawson was the first non-Matabele to learn of the last stand', '  Cultural impact, burial and memorial [[File:Zimbabwe Shangani Memorial',

by the incident, Cheer, Boys, Cheer!, was written by Augustus Harris, Cecil Raleigh and Henry Hamilton, and staged at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, starting in September 1895', ' The show tells the story of a young colonial army officer in South Africa and Rhodesia, culminating in the third act with a fictionalised account of the First Matabele War', "" This itself climaxes with a scene strongly reminiscent of Wilson's last stand"", ' The production ran for nearly six months in London, and then toured the British provinces for more than two years,; ;  reportedly drawing large crowds', ' According to historian Neil Parsons, it contributed to the patrol ""fast gain[ing] mythological status""', '  In historical terms, the Shangani Patrol subsequently became an integral part of Rhodesian identity, with Wilson and Borrow in particular woven into the national tapestry as heroic figures symbolising duty in the face of insuperable odds', ';  Their last stand together became a kind of

after Rhodes's death"", "" Also according to Rhodes's wishes, a memorial to the Shangani Patrol was erected at World's View in July 1904, and dedicated by Bishop William Gaul of Mashonaland"", ' The

Matabele messengers, Petchan and Sehuloholu, had been given a box of gold sovereigns by Lobengula, and instructed to intercept the column before it reached the river"", ' They were to tell the whites that the king admitted defeat and offered this tribute, totalling about £1,000, on the condition that the column immediately turn back and cease harassing him', ' ""Gold is the only thing that will stop the white men,"" Lobengula reportedly concluded', ' According to the inDuna, Petchan and Sehuloholu reached the column on 2 December 1893, the day before it reached the Shangani, and hid in the bush as it went by', ' They then caught up with it and gave the money and the message to two men in the rear guard', '  [[File:Sovereign Victoria 1842 662015', 'jpg|thumb|left|Gold sovereigns bearing

Company authorities made enquiries', ' No man who had been attached to the column corroborated the account', ' The Company thought it unlikely that a Matabele inDuna would simply invent a story such as this, however, and angrily speculated that if it were true, then negotiations with Lobengula might have been opened and the war ended before Wilson crossed the river, and the entire episode of the Shangani Patrol avoided (though, as historian Robert Cary writes, this surmision ignores the fact that Forbes had been ordered to capture Lobengula, not end the war)', ' Lawyers appointed by the company launched a formal investigation early in 1894', ""  Two officers' batmen, William Charles Daniel and James Wilson (no relation to Allan Wilson), soon became prime suspects, with Daniel arraigned as the senior instigator"", ' They were accused of accepting the gold from Petchan and Sehuloholu, then keeping it for themselves and not passing on the message', ' Both men denied all charges', ' Neither Daniel nor Wilson had been members of the rear guard on 2 December, though either or both could have been there at some point during the day', ' No Matabele witness recognised either of them at the court in Bulawayo, where the case was heard by the Resident Magistrate and four assessors', ""  The evidence against the batmen was largely circumstantial: both had been seen to possess unusually large amounts of gold soon after the column's return, and both had since bought farming rights, paying cash"", ' Daniel said he had won the money in his possession playing cards, while Wilson claimed to have brought his with him when he came to Rhodesia', ' Witnesses confirmed that there had been heavy gambling at Inyati camp, in which Daniel and Wilson had actively taken part, both possessing noticeable reserves in gold sovereigns', ' Sehuloholu claimed in his statement that both of the men he had met in the rear guard had fluently and perfectly spoken to him in Sindebele, but neither of the accused men knew the language, and the only member of the column who did at a fluent level was a medical orderly who had never been near the rear guard', ' The prosecutor proposed that Sehuloholu could be exaggerating the standard of Sindebele spoken by the men he had met, pointing out that most of the phrases quoted were actually relatively basic, and did not imply a profound understanding of the language', ""  Unable to definitely prove to the court where their money had come from, Daniel and Wilson were eventually found guilty, and sentenced to 14 years' hard labour"", ' However, the maximum term the Magistrate could legally impose was three months, and in 1896 they were released at the order of the High Commissioner for Southern Africa, Sir Henry Brougham Loch', "" The High Commissioner's legal team subsequently quashed the convictions altogether, saying that the evidence against Daniel and Wilson was not sufficiently conclusive"", "" The existence of Lobengula's box of sovereigns was never proven either way, and the incident never explained beyond doubt"", ""  Burnham, Ingram and Gooding  The version of events recorded by history is based on the accounts of Burnham, Ingram and Gooding, the Matabele present at the battle (particularly inDuna Mjaan), and the men of Forbes's column"", ""; ; ; ; ;  Burnham, Ingram and Gooding's stories closely corroborate each other; their version of events was accepted as true by the Court of Inquiry at Bulawayo in December 1893"", "" First-hand Matabele accounts such as Mjaan's, which were first recorded during 1894, appear to confirm the character of the break-out, saying that three of the white men they were fighting—including Burnham, whom several of them recognised—left during a lull in the battle, just after Wilson withdrew to his final position"", 'Letter dated February 1894 detailing Matabele accounts, quoted in   While all of the direct evidence given by eyewitnesses supports the findings of the Court of Inquiry, some historians and writers debate whether or not Burnham, Ingram and Gooding really were sent back by Wilson to fetch help, and suggest that they might have simply deserted when the battle got rough', ' Proponents of this desertion theory frequently portray Burnham as a man who embellished facts and coerced eyewitnesses into falsifying statements', "" The earliest recording of this claim of desertion is in a letter written in 1935 by John Coghlan, a cousin of Southern Rhodesia's first Prime Minister, Charles Coghlan"", ' John Coghlan wrote to a friend, John Carruthers, on 14 December that year that ""a very reliable man informed me that Wools-Sampson told him"" that Gooding had confessed on his deathbed (in 1899) that he and the two Americans had not actually been despatched by Wilson, and had simply left on their own accord', "" This double hearsay confession, coming from an anonymous source, is not mentioned in Gooding's 1899 obituary, which instead recounts the events as generally recorded"", '  Peter Emmerson, a historian and supporter of the desertion theory, asks why Wilson would have sent three of his men away at such a precarious moment', ' J\xa0P Lott, another historian, comments that Wilson had sent runners to Forbes twice the previous night, when he was already at very close quarters with the Matabele and with far fewer men; he surmises that it would not be out of the ordinary for the major to do so again', "" In his evaluation John O'Reilly asks why Wilson sent Gooding back with the two Americans; surely Burnham and Ingram, both seasoned scouts, were enough? Gooding writes in his account that Wilson originally only asked Burnham to ride to Forbes, and that Captain Judd suggested to Wilson that Burnham should take two men with him"", ' The Chief of Scouts requested Ingram, and Borrow asked Gooding to go too', ' Burnham also says that Borrow sent Gooding', '  Burnham, Ingram and Gooding each received the British South Africa Company Medal for their service in the First Matabele War, and all three subsequently served in the Second Matabele War of 1896–97', "" All of the officers and troopers of Forbes' column reported high praise for Burnham's actions and none reported any doubts about his conduct even decades later"", ' One member of the column, Trooper M\xa0E Weale, told the Rhodesia Herald on 22 December 1944 that once Commandant Raaff took over command it was greatly due to Burnham\'s good scouting that the column managed to get away: ""I have always felt that the honours were equally divided between these two men, to whom we owed our lives on that occasion', '"" Burnham proceeded to become a key figure for a number of commanding officers, including Frederick Carrington, Robert Baden-Powell, and Frederick Roberts', ' Carrington called him ""the finest scout who ever scouted in Africa', ' He was my Chief of Scouts in \'96 in Matabeleland and he was the eyes and ears of my force""', ' The US President Theodore Roosevelt described him in 1901 as ""a scout and a hunter of courage and ability, a man totally without fear, a sure shot, and a fighter\xa0', '', '', ' the ideal scout', '"" While fighting with the British Army in the Second Boer War, Burnham was adjudged to have shown exceptional heroism and was decorated with the Distinguished Service Order, then Britain\'s second highest military honour', '  Legacy  The last stand of the patrol was re-enacted once more at the 1899 Greater Britain Exhibition in London, during which scenes from the Matabele wars were re-created as part of a play called Savage South Africa: A Vivid, Realistic and Picturesque Representation of Life in the Wilds of Africa, culminating in ""Major Wilson\'s Last Stand""', ' The show featured Lobengula\'s son, Peter Lobengula—described as ""Prince Lobengula, the redoubtable warrior chieftain""', "" A short war film based the show's version of the final engagement, Major Wilson's Last Stand, was released by Levi, Jones & Company studios in 1899"", ' A song about the events, ""Shangani Patrol"", was written by the Rhodesian singer-songwriter John Edmond, and first recorded by the South African singer Nick Taylor in 1966 as the B-side for another Edmond composition, ""The U', 'D', 'I', ' Song"", about Rhodesia\'s Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965', ' The patriotic record topped the Rhodesian hit parade for four weeks', ' A historical war film, also called Shangani Patrol, was filmed on location and released in 1970', "" The author Alexander Fullerton wrote a novel about the patrol's last stand, entitled The White Men Sang (1958)"", ' Wilbur Smith fictionalised the Shangani patrol in his 1981 novel Men of Men', ""  Though much of the mythology surrounding the patrol and the site has dissipated in the national consciousness since the country's reconstitution as Zimbabwe in 1980, World's View endures as a tourist attraction to this day"", ' A campaign in the 1990s to dismantle the monument and remove the graves met with strong opposition from both local residents and the Department of National Museums and Monuments, partly because of the income it brings from visitors, and partly out of respect for the site and the history surrounding it', ""  Notes and referencesFootnotesSource notesOnline sources Newspaper and journal articles                                 Other sources Bibliography'                                                                             Further reading     Category:1893 in Matabeleland Category:19th century in Africa Category:Battles involving the British South Africa Company Category:Conflicts in 1893 Category:Last stands""]","They then caught up with it and gave the money and the message to two men in the rear guard.Daniel said he had won the money in his possession playing cards, while Wilson claimed to have brought his with him when he came to Rhodesia.Unable to definitely prove to the court where their money had come from, Daniel and Wilson were eventually found guilty, and sentenced to 14 years' hard labour.A campaign in the 1990s to dismantle the monument and remove the graves met with strong opposition from both local residents and the Department of National Museums and Monuments, partly because of the income it brings from visitors, and partly out of respect for the site and the history surrounding it"

by the company's attitude towards his authority, Lobengula made war on the new arrivals and the Mashonas in 1893"", ' Matabele warriors began the wholesale slaughter of Mashonas in the vicinity of Fort Victoria in July that year, and an indaba (tribal conference) organised by Company official Leander Starr Jameson to end the conflict ended with violence, and dispersion by force', ' The First Matabele War had started', '  Company columns rode from Fort Salisbury and Fort Victoria, and combined at Iron Mine Hill, around the centre point of the country, on 16 October 1893', ' Together the force totalled about 700 men, commanded by Major Patrick Forbes, and equipped with five Maxim machine guns', "" Forbes's combined column moved on the Matabele king's capital at Bulawayo, to the south-west"", ' The Matabele army mobilised to prevent Forbes from reaching the city, and twice engaged the column as it approached: on 25 October, 3,500 warriors assaulted the column near the Shangani River', ' Lobengula\'s troops were well-drilled and formidable by pre-colonial African standards, but the company\'s Maxim guns, which had never before been used in battle, far exceeded expectations, according to an eyewitness ""mow[ing] them down literally like grass""', ' By the time the Matabele withdrew, they had suffered around 1,500 fatalities; the company, on the other hand, had lost only four men', "" A week later, on 1 November, 2,000 Matabele riflemen and 4,000 warriors attacked Forbes at Bembezi, about  north-east of Bulawayo, but again they were no match for the crushing firepower of the major's Maxims: about 2,500 more Matabele were killed"", '  Lobengula fled Bulawayo as soon as he heard the news from Bembezi', ' On 3 November 1893, with the column on the outskirts of the city, he and his subjects left, torching the royal town as they went', "" In the resultant conflagration, the city's large store of ivory, gold and other treasure was destroyed, as was its ammunition magazine, which exploded"", ' The flames were still rising when the whites entered the settlement the next day; basing themselves in the ""White Man\'s Camp"" already present, they set about extinguishing the fire which engulfed the town', ' Using a tree to improvise a flagstaff, they hoisted first the Company flag, then the Union flag', "" The reconstruction of Bulawayo began almost as soon as the blaze was out, with a new white-run city rising atop the ruins of Lobengula's former residence"", ' Jameson, who now based himself in Bulawayo, wrote the following letter to the Matabele king on 7 November 1893, in English, Dutch and Zulu:  This letter, carried by John Grootboom, a coloured man from the Cape, reached Lobengula near Shiloh Mission, about  north of Bulawayo', ' The king replied in English:  Jameson did not regard this ambiguity as a proper answer, and impatiently waited for further word from the king', ' After standing by for the specified two days and receiving nothing, he correctly concluded that Lobengula was stalling him, and using the extra time to distance himself from his former capital', "" Jameson therefore made good on his pledge, and called for volunteers; he assembled a host of about 470 men, mixed together from the Mashonaland Mounted Police, the Bechuanaland Border Police, and Raaff's Rangers, an independent unit led by the eponymous Commandant Piet Raaff"", "" This force was placed under Forbes's command, with three Maxim guns attached"", ' Jameson told the major to scout the area between Shiloh and Inyati for spoor, with the ultimate objective of capturing Lobengula, and sent him out just before sunset on 14 November 1893', ""  Prelude: Forbes's pursuit of Lobengula thumb|Route of the Shangani Patrol The column left Bulawayo heading north, and, in an attempt to expedite its progress, reorganised itself into a more compact 290-man force at Shiloh"", ' Lobengula, meanwhile, rode north towards the Shangani in his wagon, which left obvious tracks in its wake', "" Following the wagon tracks, Forbes's men were soon hot on the trail, routinely finding recently abandoned Matabele camps, provisions and stragglers"", ' Heavy rain slowed both the king and his pursuers, and led Forbes to split his force again; moving on with a flying column of 160 men, he sent the rest back with the wagons', ' He pushed on, and on 3 December 1893 reached the southern bank of the Shangani, from where he could clearly see Matabele hastily driving cattle behind an impi (regiment) of warriors', ' The presence of smouldering fires beside the native column betrayed the fact that they had just crossed', ' Wishing to know whether the king had crossed here or at another point on the river, Forbes sent Major Allan Wilson across to scout ahead with 12 men and eight officers, and told him to return by nightfall', '  Meanwhile, Forbes formed a laager (improvised fort) about  from the southern bank', ' There, he interrogated a captive Matabele, the son of an inDuna (tribal leader), who said that the king was indeed where Wilson had gone, and was ill (the exact ailment was not known for sure, the prisoner said, but was suspected to be gout)', ' The inDunas son said that Lobengula had with him a force of about 3,000 warriors, about half of whom were armed with Martini–Henry rifles', "" They were mixed together from various regiments of the previously routed Matabele army, and largely demoralised, but still fiercely determined to prevent Lobengula's capture"", "" Most prominent were the Imbezu, Ingubo and Insukameni Regiments; the Imbezu, Lobengula's favourite, was generally considered the strongest"", "" After three weeks in pursuit of the king, Forbes's rations were running perilously short"", ' He therefore resolved to attack the next day (4 December), hoping to be able to turn back for Bulawayo with Lobengula in custody before nightfall', ""  Wilson's men remained north of the river far longer than expected, and had still not returned when darkness fell"", "" Forbes, meanwhile, received a report that most of Lobengula's force, commanded by inDuna Mjaan, had separated from the king and was moving to attack the laager the same night (this was actually an exaggeration; only about 300 riflemen had split from the main Matabele force, though they were indeed south of the river, undetected by Forbes)"", ' Visibility was poor by now, and rain periodically fell', "" The laager received no word from Wilson until about 21:00, when Sergeant-Major Judge and Corporal Ebbage arrived from across the river to tell Forbes that Wilson had found Lobengula's tracks, and followed him for "", ' Wilson regarded the chances of taking the king alive as so good that he was going to remain north of the river overnight', ' He asked Forbes to send more men and a Maxim gun in the morning, but did not explain what he planned to do with them', '  The Shangani Patrol continued its approach during the late evening, and scouted close to the bush enclosure housing Lobengula', ' Captain William Napier repeatedly called to the king in the Matabele language, Sindebele, but received no reply from the Matabele leaders, who remained silent and hid themselves', "" The patrol's actions confused the Matabele, who could not understand why there appeared to be so few Company soldiers, nor why they would reveal their position like this"", "" They concluded that it must be a trap, and were only satisfied that it was not when Wilson's men had stopped during their approach to call to Lobengula five times"", ' Following the fifth call from Napier, Mjaan ordered his riflemen to gather around the patrol, intending to pocket it', ' Noticing this, Wilson ordered a retreat, and took up a well-covered position in the bush where he could hide until daybreak', ' When Lieutenant Hofmeyer and Troopers Bradburn and Colquhoun were lost amid the increasingly stormy night, Wilson briefly backtracked to recover them', '  On returning to his bush camp, Wilson sent a further message to the laager, which reached its destination at around 23:00: Napier, Scout Bain and Trooper Robertson were the men acting as runners', ' Wilson repeated that he was going to stay north of the river overnight, close to the king, and asked Forbes to bring the whole column across by 04:00 in the morning', ' Forbes thought it unwise to attempt a full river crossing at night, which he reasoned might lead to his force being surrounded in the darkness and massacred, but also felt he could not recall Wilson, as to do so would be to lose Lobengula for sure', '  As a compromise, Forbes sent Captain Henry Borrow across with 21 men at 01:00 on 4 December, and told Borrow to relay to Wilson that the laager was surrounded, and ""expected to be attacked any moment""', "" Forbes apparently intended for Borrow's reinforcements to secure Wilson's position, but historian W\xa0D Gale writes that this was a serious tactical error on Forbes's part: the addition of Borrow's men made Wilson's patrol too large to be a mere reconnoitring force, but still too small to overpower the Matabele and capture the king"", "" Indeed, Wilson and his officers looked on gloomily when Borrow's men arrived soon after dawn, fewer in number than expected and without the requested Maxim gun"", ' Only 20 of the reinforcements (including Borrow himself) reached Wilson—Troopers Landsberg and Nesbitt became separated from the main group along the way, and eventually rejoined Forbes during the morning', '

optimistic about their prospects: ""This is the end"" said one', ' British soldier and historian Roger Marston postulates that the patrol might still have been safe had it not now pursued the king, but Wilson decided to proceed: ""Let\'s ride on Lobengula,"" he said', ' Several analysts comment that this was perhaps excessively rash', ' Marston says that Wilson\'s actions ""had a flavour of doomed resignation about them"", and suggests that the major believed no other path was open, and was therefore going for broke', ' The Matabele hovered around the vicinity, waiting to see what Wilson would do next', "" On the southern side of the river, the 300 Matabele riflemen took up a well-covered position near the riverbank, about  to the left of Forbes's position"", ' Hidden by a patch of scrub, they remained undetected by the Company troops', ""  Wilson, Borrow and the 35 others made for Lobengula's enclosure"", "" The king's wagon was still there, but when Wilson called to him, there was no answer"", ' The king had moved on during the night', ' At that moment, the troopers heard the sound of rifles being cocked in the wood surrounding them', ' A Matabele inDuna stepped out from behind a tree and announced that the enclosure was surrounded by thousands of Matabele who wanted to ""see if the white men were afraid to die', '"" He then fired his rifle to signal the start of the attack to his men', ' A volley from the Matabele riflemen followed, but most of the shots went too high; no Company trooper was hit', "" The only casualties of this opening volley were two of the patrol's horses"", ' Wilson immediately ordered his men to fall back, first to an antheap, then to a thick wood', ' Three of them were wounded during this retreat, but none fatally', '  Hearing the shots from the northern side of the river, Forbes uneasily moved towards the southern bank, intending to cross and help Wilson', "" However, Forbes's fears of an ambush proved to be well-founded; at an opportune moment, the Matabele in the scrub opened fire, catching the column in the open"", "";  The ambushers' shots were initially wild and inaccurate, but they soon began to focus their fire on the exposed Maxim guns and horses, forcing the troopers to retreat to cover"", ' Five Company soldiers were injured', ' The resulting skirmish lasted about an hour, by which time the Shangani had been severely swollen by heavy rains upstream, causing it to flood', '  Meanwhile, Wilson marched his officers and men back towards the river, hoping to reunite with Forbes', ' They moved on for about , but soon noticed that a line of Matabele warriors was blocking their way to the river', ' Wilson refused to sacrifice his wounded by attempting to break through', ' In an act of desperation, he instead sent three of his men—American scouts Frederick Russell Burnham and Pearl ""Pete"" Ingram, and Australian Trooper William Gooding—to charge through the Matabele line, cross the river and bring reinforcements back to help, while he, Borrow and the rest made a last stand', ' Burnham, Ingram and Gooding broke through while the Matabele closed in on the surrounded patrol from a distance, and began to fire on it from cover, killing several of its men', ' After a while, Mjaan ordered his men to charge forward and finish them off, but the Matabele soon fell back, having taken about 40 fatalities', '  Burnham, Ingram and Gooding reached the Shangani about 08:00, but quickly saw that the water had risen far too high for Forbes to provide any assistance', ' Realising the futility of turning back to Wilson without help, they decided to rejoin Forbes anyway, and to that end traversed the swollen river with considerable difficulty', ' They then rode to where the battle on the southern side was still going on', ' On reaching the main column shaken and out of breath, Burnham leapt from his horse and ran to Forbes: ""I think I may say that we are the sole survivors of that party,"" he quietly confided, before loading his rifle and joining the skirmish', ""; ;   Matabele victory north of the river; Wilson's last stand  What happened to the Shangani Patrol after this point is known only from Matabele sources"", "" According to these accounts, the warriors offered the remaining whites their lives if they surrendered, but Wilson's men refused to give up"", ' They used their dead horses for cover, and killed more than ten times their own number (about 500, Mjaan estimated), but were steadily whittled down as the overwhelming Matabele force closed in from all sides', ' The Company soldiers continued fighting even when grievously wounded, to the astonishment of the Matabele, who thought the whites must be bewitched: ""These are not men but magicians,"" said one Matabele inDuna', '  Late in the afternoon, after hours of fighting, Wilson\'s men ran out of ammunition, and reacted to this by rising to their feet, shaking each other\'s hands and singing a song, possibly ""God Save the Queen""', ' The Matabele downed their own rifles and ended the battle charging with assegai spears', ' Some of the whites allegedly used their last bullets to commit suicide', ' According to an eyewitness, ""the white inDuna"" (Wilson) was the last to die, standing motionless before the Matabele with blood streaming from wounds all over his body', ' After a few moments of hesitation, a young warrior ran forward and killed him with his assegai', ' The Matabele usually mutilated the bodies of their foes after a victory, but on this occasion they did not: ""The white men died so bravely we would not treat them as we do the cowardly Mashonas and others,"" an inDuna explained', "" At Mjaan's orders, the bodies of the patrol were left untouched, though the whites' clothes and two of their facial skins were collected the next morning to serve as proof to Lobengula of the battle's outcome"", ' ""I had two sons killed that day,"" Ingubo warrior

happened"", ' Guessing (correctly) that all Company men beyond the river had been killed, they turned and trekked back to Bulawayo in miserable fashion, their supplies all but gone and the Matabele impeding their progress at every turn', '  Matabele raiding parties attacked the retreating column six times during its two-week journey back to Bulawayo', ' In pouring rain, the dishevelled men were soon mostly on foot, existing off horse meat and wearing makeshift shoes made from ammunition wallets', ' Forbes felt so humiliated by the events that he retreated from command in all but name, surrendering de facto control to Commandant Raaff', ' In leading the column back to Bulawayo, Raaff repeatedly drew on his experience from the Anglo-Zulu War to ensure the survival of the haggard men', ' He avoided several Matabele ambushes, and at one point set up a convincing decoy camp that the Matabele fired on for half a day, wasting much of their ammunition', ""  On the column's inglorious return to Bulawayo on 18 December 1893, Forbes was received in muted disgrace"", ' The officers and men stood on parade for Cecil Rhodes, and the Company chief passed the major without a word', "" Raaff, on the other hand, was publicly commended by Rhodes, and thanked for ensuring the column's safe return"", ""  Meanwhile, Lobengula moved to the north-east, now well out of the

convened an indaba at which he and his contemporaries met with James Dawson, a trader known to them for many years, who offered the olive branch on behalf of the company', ' The izinDuna unanimously accepted', ' They also told the trader what had happened to the Shangani Patrol, and led him to the battle site to survey it, as well as to examine and identify the largely skeletonised bodies of the

that the king admitted defeat and offered this tribute, totalling about £1,000, on the condition that the column immediately turn back and cease harassing him', ' ""Gold is the only thing that will stop the white men,"" Lobengula reportedly concluded', ' According to the inDuna, Petchan and Sehuloholu reached the column on 2 December 1893, the day before it reached the Shangani, and hid in the bush as it went by', ' They then caught up with it and gave the money and the message to two men in the rear guard', '  [[File:Sovereign Victoria 1842 662015', 'jpg|thumb|left|Gold sovereigns bearing

Company authorities made enquiries', ' No man who had been attached to the column corroborated the account', ' The Company thought it unlikely that a Matabele inDuna would simply invent a story such as this, however, and angrily speculated that if it were true, then negotiations with Lobengula might have been opened and the war ended before Wilson crossed the river, and the entire episode of the Shangani Patrol avoided (though, as historian Robert Cary writes, this surmision ignores the fact that Forbes had been ordered to capture Lobengula, not end the war)', ' Lawyers appointed by the company launched a formal investigation early in 1894', ""  Two officers' batmen, William Charles Daniel and James Wilson (no relation to Allan Wilson), soon became prime suspects, with Daniel arraigned as the senior instigator"", ' They were accused of accepting the gold from Petchan and Sehuloholu, then keeping it for themselves and not passing on the message', ' Both men denied all charges', ' Neither Daniel nor Wilson had been members of the rear guard on 2 December, though either or both could have been there at some point during the day', ' No Matabele witness recognised either of them at the court in Bulawayo, where the case was heard by the Resident Magistrate and four assessors', ""  The evidence against the batmen was largely circumstantial: both had been seen to possess unusually large amounts of gold soon after the column's return, and both had since bought farming rights, paying cash"", ' Daniel said he had won the money in his possession playing cards, while Wilson claimed to have brought his with him when he came to Rhodesia', ' Witnesses confirmed that there had been heavy gambling at Inyati camp, in which Daniel and Wilson had actively taken part, both possessing noticeable reserves in gold sovereigns', ' Sehuloholu claimed in his statement that both of the men he had met in the rear guard had fluently and perfectly spoken to him in Sindebele, but neither of the accused men knew the language, and the only member of the column who did at a fluent level was a medical orderly who had never been near the rear guard', ' The prosecutor proposed that Sehuloholu could be exaggerating the standard of Sindebele spoken by the men he had met, pointing out that most of the phrases quoted were actually relatively basic, and did not imply a profound understanding of the language', ""  Unable to definitely prove to the court where their money had come from, Daniel and Wilson were eventually found guilty, and sentenced to 14 years' hard

not actually been despatched by Wilson, and had simply left on their own accord', "" This double hearsay confession, coming from an anonymous source, is not mentioned in Gooding's 1899 obituary, which

moment', ' J\xa0P Lott, another historian, comments that Wilson had sent runners to Forbes twice the previous night, when he was already at very close quarters with the Matabele and with far fewer men; he surmises that it would not be out of the ordinary for the major to do so again', "" In his evaluation John O'Reilly asks why Wilson sent Gooding back with the two Americans; surely Burnham and

' Accordingly, Britain granted independence to Northern Rhodesia on 24 October 1964', ' However, when the new nationalists changed its name to Zambia and began tentatively at first and later in rapid

survivors on the ground"", ' The majority of Rhodesians, both black and white, saw the attack as an act of terrorism', ' A fierce Rhodesian backlash followed against enemy strongholds and increased racial tension even though few black Rhodesians supported attacks of this kind', "" Reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as Time magazine, but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments, much to the Rhodesian government's indignation"", '  Talks between Nkomo and Prime Minister Ian Smith, which had been progressing promisingly, were immediately suspended by the Rhodesians, with Smith calling Nkomo a ""monster""', ' On 10 September, Smith announced the extension of martial law over selected areas', ' The Rhodesian Security Forces launched several retaliatory strikes into Zambia and Mozambique over the following months, attacking both ZIPRA and its rival, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA)', ' The attack on ZIPRA in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were refugees camping in and around guerrilla positions', ' In February 1979, ZIPRA shot down Air Rhodesia Flight 827, another civilian flight, in an almost identical incident', '  Background [[File:Zimbabwe in Africa', 'svg|thumb|upright|Rhodesia]] A dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty to the self-governing colony of Rhodesia led the colonial government, headed by Prime Minister Ian Smith, to unilaterally declare independence from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965', ' The idea of ""no independence before majority rule"" had recently gained ground in Britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation, and Rhodesia\'s government was dominated by the country\'s white minority, so the unilateral declaration went unrecognised internationally', ' Britain and the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia', ""  Two rival communist-backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule: the Chinese-aligned Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), mostly comprising Shonas, created the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and adopted aspects of Maoist doctrine, while the Ndebele-dominated Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), aligned with Soviet-style Marxism–Leninism and the Warsaw Pact, mobilised the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA)"", ';   These guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the ""Second Chimurenga"" against the Rhodesian government and security forces', ' The resulting conflict, the Rhodesian Bush War, began in earnest in December 1972, when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms in north-eastern Rhodesia', ""  After the security forces mounted a successful counter-insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974, developments overseas caused the conflict's momentum to shift in the insurgents' favour"", "" The leftist Carnation Revolution of April 1974 caused Portugal to withdraw its key economic support for Smith's administration, and led to Mozambique's independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with ZANU"", "" Around the same time, Rhodesia's other main backer, South Africa, adopted a détente initiative that forced a ceasefire, giving the guerrillas time to regroup"", ' Following the abortive Victoria Falls Conference of August 1975, Smith and the ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo held unsuccessful talks between December 1975 and March 1976', ' ZANU and ZAPU announced in October 1976, during the run-up to the unsuccessful Geneva Conference in December, that they would henceforth attend conferences as a joint ""Patriotic Front""', '  In March 1978, Smith and non-militant nationalist groups headed by Bishop Abel Muzorewa, the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole and Chief Jeremiah Chirau agreed what became the ""Internal Settlement""', ' This created a joint black–white transitional government, with the country due to be reconstituted as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, pursuant to multiracial elections', ' ZANU and ZAPU were invited to participate, but refused; Nkomo sardonically dubbed Smith\'s black colleagues ""the blacksmiths""', ' ZANU proclaimed 1978 to be ""The Year of the People"" as the war continued', "" Officials from Muzorewa's United African National Council, sent to the provinces to explain the Internal Settlement to rural blacks, were killed by Marxist–Leninist guerrillas"", ' Insurgents also began to target Christian missionaries, climaxing in the killing of nine British missionaries and four children at Elim Mission near the Mozambican border in the Vumba massacre on 23 June', '  The transitional government was badly received abroad, partly because the Internal Settlement kept control of law enforcement, the military, the judiciary and the civil service under white control', "" No country recognised Rhodesia's interim administration"", ' Smith again worked to bring Nkomo into the government, hoping this would lend it some credence domestically, prompt diplomatic recognition overseas, and help the security forces defeat ZANLA', ' Starting on 14

women and two girls (aged 11 and 4)', '  The guerrillas, who were armed with AK-47 rifles, presented themselves to the 10 passengers as friendly, saying they would summon help and bring water', ' They spoke in English, both to the survivors and among themselves', ' They told the passengers to congregate around a point a few metres from the wreckage; when the survivors said that some of them were

1890 to justify sending the Pioneer Column, a group of white settlers protected by well-armed British South Africa Police (BSAP) and guided by the big game hunter Frederick Selous, through Matabeleland and into Shona territory to establish Fort Salisbury (now Harare)', ' In 1893–1894, with the help of their new Maxim guns, the BSAP defeated the Ndebele in the First Matabele War, a war which also resulted in the death of King Lobengula and the death of most of the members of the Shangani Patrol', ' Shortly after the disastrous BSAP Jameson Raid into the Transvaal Republic, the Ndebele were led by their spiritual leader Mlimo against the white colonials and thus began the Second Matabele War (1896–97) which resulted in the extermination of nearly half the British settlers', ' After months of bloodshed, Mlimo was found and shot by the American scout Frederick Russell Burnham and soon thereafter Rhodes walked unarmed into the Ndebele stronghold in Matobo Hills and persuaded the impi to lay down their arms, effectively ending the revolt', ""  A legislative council was created in 1899 to manage the company's civil affairs, with a minority of elected seats, through which the BSAC had to pass government measures"", ' As the company was a British institution in which settlers and capitalists owned most shares, and local black African tribal chiefs the remainder, and the electorate to this council was limited to those shareholders, the electorate was almost exclusively white settlers', ' Over time as more settlers arrived and a growing number had less than the amount of land required to own a share in the company or where in trades supporting the company as workers, successive activism resulted in first increasing the proportion of elected seats, and eventually allowing non-share holders the right to vote in the election', ' Prior to about 1918, the opinion among the electorate supported continued BSAC rule but opinion changed because of the development of the country and increased settlement', ' In addition, a decision in the British courts that land not in private ownership belonged to the British Crown rather than the BSAC gave

settler population', ' The CAF sought to emulate the experience of Australia, Canada and South Africa – wherein groups of colonies had been federated together to form viable independent nations', ' Originally designed to be ""an indissoluble federation"", the CAF quickly started to unravel due to the low proportion of British and other white citizens in relation to the larger black populations', ' Additionally, by incorporating the tribes within the Federation as potential citizens, the Federation created the paradoxical situation of having a white elite owning most of the land and capital, whilst using cheap black labour', '  The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was dissolved on 1 January 1964', ' However, it was expected that only Nyasaland would be let go, whilst the remainder of

of these were relatively new to the region, were primarily in the extraction business, had little landed interests, and were more amenable to allowing black nationalism than the Southern Rhodesians', ' Accordingly, Britain granted independence to Northern Rhodesia on 24 October 1964', ' However, when the new nationalists changed its name to Zambia and began tentatively at first and later in rapid march an Africanisation campaign, Southern Rhodesia remained a British colony, resisting attempts to bring in majority rule', ' The colony attempted to change its name to Rhodesia although this was not recognised by the United Kingdom', "" The majority of the Federation's military and financial assets went to Southern Rhodesia, since the British Government did not wish to see them fall into the

the three member states (due to its vast copper mines) and had contributed more to the overall building of infrastructure than the other two members did', ' Southern Rhodesia, recognising an inevitable dissolution of the Federation, was quick to use federal funds in building its infrastructure ahead of the others', ' A key component of this was the building of the Kariba Dam and its hydroelectric facility (shafts, control centre, etc', '), which was situated on the Southern Rhodesian side of the Zambezi Gorge', ' This situation caused some embarrassment for the Zambian government later when it was a ""front line state"" in support of insurgents into Rhodesia in that its major source of electric power was controlled by the Rhodesian state', '  Return to ""Rhodesia""  With the

warriors in pre-Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), during the First Matabele War"", ' Headed by Major Allan Wilson, the patrol was attacked just north of the Shangani River in Matabeleland, Rhodesia', ' Its dramatic last stand, sometimes called ""Wilson\'s Last Stand"", achieved a prominent place in the British public imagination and, subsequently, in Rhodesian history, similarly to events such as the Battle of the Little Bighorn in the United States, the Battle of Shiroyama in Japan, the Battle of the Alamo in Texas, and the Greeks\' last stand at Thermopylae', '  The patrol comprised elements of the Mashonaland Mounted Police and the Bechuanaland Border Police', "" Scouting ahead of Major Patrick Forbes's column attempting the capture of the Matabele King Lobengula (following his flight from his capital Bulawayo a month before), it crossed the Shangani late on 3 December 1893"", "" It moved on Lobengula the next morning, but was ambushed by a host of Matabele riflemen and warriors near the king's wagon"", ' Surrounded and outnumbered about a hundred-fold, the patrol made a last stand as three of its number broke out and rode back to the river to muster reinforcements from Forbes', ' However, the Shangani had risen significantly in flood, and Forbes was himself involved in a skirmish near the southern bank; Wilson and his men therefore remained isolated to the north', ' After fighting to the last cartridge, and killing over ten times their own number, they were annihilated', ""  The patrol's members, particularly Wilson and Captain Henry Borrow, were elevated in death to the status of national heroes, representing endeavour in the face of insurmountable odds"", ' The anniversary of the battle on 4 December 1893 became an annual public holiday in Rhodesia two years later, and was an official non-work day until 1920', ' A historical war film depicting the episode, Shangani Patrol, was produced and released in 1970', ""  Controversy surrounds the breakout before the last stand—which various historians have posited might have actually been desertion—and a box of gold sovereigns, which a Matabele inDuna (leader) later said had been given to two unidentified men from Forbes's rear guard on 2 December, along with a message that Lobengula admitted defeat and wanted the column to stop pursuing him"", ' Two batmen were initially found guilty of accepting the gold, keeping it for themselves and not passing on the message, but the evidence against them was inconclusive and largely circumstantial; the convictions were ultimately overturned', '

loincloth and a necklace made from what appear to be the teeth of various creatures', ' He holds a long spear in his right hand, which rests on the ground', ']] Amid the Scramble for Africa during the 1880s, the South African-based businessman and politician Cecil Rhodes envisioned the annexation to the British Empire of a swathe of territory connecting the Cape of Good Hope and Cairo—respectively at the southern and northern tips of Africa—and the concurrent construction of a line of rail linking the two', ' On geopolitical maps, British territories were generally marked in red or pink, so this concept became known as the ""Cape to Cairo red line""', "" In the immediate vicinity of the Cape, this ambition was challenged by the presence of independent states to the north-east of Britain's Cape Colony: the Boer republics, and to the north of these the Kingdom of Matabeleland under Lobengula"", ' Having secured the Rudd Concession on mining rights from King Lobengula on 30 October 1888, Rhodes and his British South Africa Company were granted a royal charter by Queen Victoria in October 1889', "" The company was empowered under this charter to trade with local rulers, form banks, own and manage land, and raise and run a police force: the British South Africa Company's Police, renamed the Mashonaland Mounted Police in 1892"", '  In return for these rights, the company would govern and develop any territory it acquired, while respecting laws enacted by extant African rulers, and upholding free trade within its borders', ' The first settlers referred to their new home as ""Rhodesia"", after Rhodes', ' Though the company made good on most of its pledges, the assent of Lobengula and other native leaders, particularly regarding mining rights, was often evaded, misrepresented or simply ignored', ' It also offended Lobengula by demanding that he stop the customary Matabele raids on the Mashona people who inhabited the white-governed areas', "" Angered by the company's attitude towards his authority, Lobengula made war on the new arrivals and the Mashonas in 1893"", ' Matabele warriors began the wholesale slaughter of Mashonas in the vicinity of Fort Victoria in July that year, and an indaba (tribal conference) organised by Company official Leander Starr Jameson to end the conflict ended with violence, and dispersion by force', ' The First Matabele War had started', '  Company columns rode from Fort Salisbury and Fort Victoria, and combined at Iron Mine Hill, around the centre point of the country, on 16 October 1893', ' Together the force totalled about 700 men, commanded by Major Patrick Forbes, and equipped with five Maxim machine guns', "" Forbes's combined column moved on the Matabele king's capital at Bulawayo, to the south-west"", ' The Matabele army mobilised to prevent Forbes from reaching the city, and twice engaged the column as it approached: on 25 October, 3,500 warriors assaulted the column near the Shangani River', ' Lobengula\'s troops were well-drilled and formidable by pre-colonial African standards, but the company\'s Maxim guns, which had never before been used in battle, far exceeded expectations, according to an eyewitness ""mow[ing] them down literally like grass""', ' By the time the Matabele withdrew, they had suffered around 1,500 fatalities; the company, on the other hand, had lost only four men', "" A week later, on 1 November, 2,000 Matabele riflemen and 4,000 warriors attacked Forbes at Bembezi, about  north-east of Bulawayo, but again they were no match for the crushing firepower of the major's Maxims: about 2,500 more Matabele were killed"", '  Lobengula fled Bulawayo as soon as he heard the news from Bembezi', ' On 3 November 1893, with the column on the outskirts of the city, he and his subjects left, torching the royal town as they went', "" In the resultant conflagration, the city's large store of ivory, gold and other treasure was destroyed, as was its ammunition magazine, which exploded"", ' The flames were still rising when the whites entered the settlement the next day; basing themselves in the ""White Man\'s Camp"" already present, they set about extinguishing the fire which engulfed the town', ' Using a tree to improvise a flagstaff, they hoisted first the Company flag, then the Union flag', "" The reconstruction of Bulawayo began almost as soon as the blaze was out, with a new white-run city rising atop the ruins of Lobengula's former residence"", ' Jameson, who now based himself in Bulawayo, wrote the following letter to the Matabele king on 7 November 1893, in English, Dutch and Zulu:  This letter, carried by John Grootboom, a coloured man from the Cape, reached Lobengula near Shiloh Mission, about  north of Bulawayo', ' The king replied in English:  Jameson did not regard this ambiguity as a proper answer, and impatiently waited for further word from the king', ' After standing by for the specified two days and receiving nothing, he correctly concluded that Lobengula was stalling him, and using the extra time to distance himself from his former capital', "" Jameson therefore made good on his pledge, and called for volunteers; he assembled a host of about 470 men, mixed together from the Mashonaland Mounted Police, the Bechuanaland Border Police, and Raaff's Rangers, an independent unit led by the eponymous Commandant Piet Raaff"", "" This force was placed under Forbes's command, with three Maxim guns attached"", ' Jameson told the major to scout the area between Shiloh and Inyati for spoor, with the ultimate objective of capturing Lobengula, and sent him out just before sunset on 14 November 1893', ""  Prelude: Forbes's pursuit of Lobengula thumb|Route of the Shangani Patrol The column left Bulawayo heading north, and, in an attempt to expedite its progress, reorganised itself into a more compact 290-man force at Shiloh"", ' Lobengula, meanwhile, rode north towards the Shangani in his wagon, which left obvious tracks in its wake', "" Following the wagon tracks, Forbes's men were soon hot on the trail, routinely finding recently abandoned Matabele camps, provisions and stragglers"", ' Heavy rain slowed both the king and his pursuers, and led Forbes to split his force again; moving on with a flying column of 160 men, he sent the rest back with the wagons', ' He pushed on, and on 3 December 1893 reached the southern bank of the Shangani, from where he could clearly see Matabele hastily driving cattle behind an impi (regiment) of warriors', ' The presence of smouldering fires beside the native column betrayed the fact that they had just crossed', ' Wishing to know whether the king had crossed here or at another point on the river, Forbes sent Major Allan Wilson across to scout ahead with 12 men and eight officers, and told him to return by nightfall', '  Meanwhile, Forbes formed a laager (improvised fort) about  from the southern bank', ' There, he interrogated a captive Matabele, the son of an inDuna (tribal leader), who said that the king was indeed where Wilson had gone, and was ill (the exact ailment was not known for sure, the prisoner said, but was suspected to be gout)', ' The inDunas son said that Lobengula had with him a force of about 3,000 warriors, about half of whom were armed with Martini–Henry rifles', "" They were mixed together from various regiments of the previously routed Matabele army, and largely demoralised, but still fiercely determined to prevent Lobengula's capture"", "" Most prominent were the Imbezu, Ingubo and Insukameni Regiments; the Imbezu, Lobengula's favourite, was generally considered the strongest"", "" After three weeks in pursuit of the king, Forbes's rations were running perilously short"", ' He therefore resolved to attack the next day (4 December), hoping to be able to turn back for Bulawayo with Lobengula in custody before nightfall', ""  Wilson's men remained north of the river far longer than expected, and had still not returned when darkness fell"", "" Forbes, meanwhile, received a report that most of Lobengula's force, commanded by inDuna Mjaan, had separated from the king and was moving to attack the laager the same night (this was actually an exaggeration; only about 300 riflemen had split from the main Matabele force, though they were indeed south of the river, undetected by Forbes)"", ' Visibility was poor by now, and rain periodically fell', "" The laager received no word from Wilson until about 21:00, when Sergeant-Major Judge and Corporal Ebbage arrived from across the river to tell Forbes that Wilson had found Lobengula's tracks, and followed him for "", ' Wilson regarded the chances of taking the king alive as so good that he was going to remain north of the river overnight', ' He asked Forbes to send more men and a Maxim gun in the morning, but did not explain what he planned to do with them', '  The Shangani Patrol continued its approach during the late evening, and scouted close to the bush enclosure housing Lobengula', ' Captain William Napier repeatedly called to the king in the Matabele language, Sindebele, but received no reply from the Matabele leaders, who remained silent and hid themselves', "" The patrol's actions confused the Matabele, who could not understand why there appeared to be so few Company soldiers, nor why they would reveal their position like this"", "" They concluded that it must be a trap, and were only satisfied that it was not when Wilson's men had stopped during their approach to call to Lobengula five times"", ' Following the fifth call from Napier, Mjaan ordered his riflemen to gather around the patrol, intending to pocket it', ' Noticing this, Wilson ordered a retreat, and took up a well-covered position in the bush where he could hide until daybreak', ' When Lieutenant Hofmeyer and Troopers Bradburn and Colquhoun were lost amid the increasingly stormy night, Wilson briefly backtracked to recover them', '  On returning to his bush camp, Wilson sent a further message to the laager, which reached its destination at around 23:00: Napier, Scout Bain and Trooper Robertson were the men acting as runners', ' Wilson repeated that he was going to stay north of the river overnight, close to the king, and asked Forbes to bring the whole column across by 04:00 in the morning', ' Forbes thought it unwise to attempt a full river crossing at night, which he reasoned might lead to his force being surrounded in the darkness and massacred, but also felt he could not recall Wilson, as to do so would be to lose Lobengula for sure', '  As a compromise, Forbes sent Captain Henry Borrow across with 21 men at 01:00 on 4 December, and told Borrow to relay to Wilson that the laager was surrounded, and ""expected to be attacked any moment""', "" Forbes apparently intended for Borrow's reinforcements to secure Wilson's position, but historian W\xa0D Gale writes that this was a serious tactical error on Forbes's part: the addition of Borrow's men made Wilson's patrol too large to be a mere reconnoitring force, but still too small to overpower the Matabele and capture the king"", "" Indeed, Wilson and his officers looked on gloomily when Borrow's men arrived soon after dawn, fewer in number than expected and without the requested Maxim gun"", ' Only 20 of the reinforcements (including Borrow himself) reached Wilson—Troopers Landsberg and Nesbitt became separated from the main group along the way, and eventually rejoined Forbes during the morning', ' Trooper Robertson returned to Wilson with Borrow, giving the patrol a total of 37 men, including its officers', '  Engagement  Matabele ambushes on both sides of the river [[File:Shangani patrol map',

optimistic about their prospects: ""This is the end"" said one', ' British soldier and historian Roger Marston postulates that the patrol might still have been safe had it not now pursued the king, but Wilson decided to proceed: ""Let\'s ride on Lobengula,"" he said', ' Several analysts comment that this was perhaps excessively rash', ' Marston says that Wilson\'s actions ""had a flavour of doomed resignation about them"", and suggests that the major believed no other path was open, and was therefore going for broke', ' The Matabele hovered around the vicinity, waiting to see what Wilson would do next', "" On the southern side of the river, the 300 Matabele riflemen took up a well-covered position near the riverbank, about  to the left of Forbes's position"", ' Hidden by a patch of scrub, they remained undetected by the Company troops', ""  Wilson, Borrow and the 35 others made for Lobengula's enclosure"", "" The king's wagon was still there, but when Wilson called to him, there was no answer"", ' The king had moved on during the night', ' At that moment, the troopers heard the sound of rifles being cocked in the wood surrounding them', ' A Matabele inDuna stepped out from behind a tree and announced that the enclosure was surrounded by thousands of Matabele who wanted to ""see if the white men were afraid to die', '"" He then fired his rifle to signal the start of the attack to his men', ' A volley from the Matabele riflemen followed, but most of the shots went too high; no Company trooper was hit', "" The only casualties of this opening volley were two of the patrol's horses"", ' Wilson immediately ordered his men to fall back, first to an antheap, then to a thick wood', ' Three of them were wounded during this retreat, but none fatally', '  Hearing the shots from the northern side of the river, Forbes uneasily moved towards the southern bank, intending to cross and help Wilson', "" However, Forbes's fears of an ambush proved to be well-founded; at an opportune moment, the Matabele in the scrub opened fire, catching the column in the open"", "";  The ambushers' shots were initially wild and inaccurate, but they soon began to focus their fire on the exposed Maxim guns and horses, forcing the troopers to retreat to cover"", ' Five Company soldiers were injured', ' The resulting skirmish lasted about an hour, by which time the Shangani had been severely swollen by heavy rains upstream, causing it to flood', '  Meanwhile, Wilson marched his officers and men back towards the river, hoping to reunite with Forbes', ' They moved on for about , but soon noticed that a line of Matabele warriors was blocking their way to the river', ' Wilson refused to sacrifice his wounded by attempting to break through', ' In an act of desperation, he instead sent three of his men—American scouts Frederick Russell Burnham and Pearl ""Pete"" Ingram, and Australian Trooper William Gooding—to charge through the Matabele line, cross the river and bring reinforcements back to help, while he, Borrow and the rest made a last stand', ' Burnham, Ingram and Gooding broke through while the Matabele closed in on the surrounded patrol from a distance, and began to fire on it from cover, killing several of its men', ' After a while, Mjaan ordered his men to charge forward and finish them off, but the Matabele soon fell back, having taken about 40 fatalities', '  Burnham, Ingram and Gooding reached the Shangani about 08:00, but quickly saw that the water had risen far too high for Forbes to provide any assistance', ' Realising the futility of turning back to Wilson without help, they decided to rejoin Forbes anyway, and to that end traversed the swollen river with considerable difficulty', ' They then rode to where the battle on the southern side was still going on', ' On reaching the main column shaken and out of breath, Burnham leapt from his horse and ran to Forbes: ""I think I may say that we are the sole survivors of that party,"" he quietly confided, before loading his rifle and joining the skirmish', ""; ;   Matabele victory north of the river; Wilson's last stand  What happened to the Shangani Patrol after this point is known only from Matabele sources"", "" According to these accounts, the warriors offered the remaining whites their lives if they surrendered, but Wilson's men refused to give up"", ' They used their dead horses for cover, and killed more than ten times their own number (about 500, Mjaan estimated), but were steadily whittled down as the overwhelming Matabele force closed in from all sides', ' The Company soldiers continued fighting even when grievously wounded, to the astonishment of the Matabele, who thought the whites must be bewitched: ""These are not men but magicians,"" said one Matabele inDuna', '  Late in the afternoon, after hours of fighting, Wilson\'s men ran out of ammunition, and reacted to this by rising to their feet, shaking each other\'s hands and singing a song, possibly ""God Save the Queen""', ' The Matabele downed their own rifles and ended the battle charging with assegai spears', ' Some of the whites allegedly used their last bullets to commit suicide', ' According to an eyewitness, ""the white inDuna"" (Wilson) was the last to die, standing motionless before the Matabele with blood streaming from wounds all over his body', ' After a few moments of hesitation, a young warrior ran forward and killed him with his assegai', ' The Matabele usually mutilated the bodies of their foes after a victory, but on this occasion they did not: ""The white men died so bravely we would not treat them as we do the cowardly Mashonas and others,"" an inDuna explained', "" At Mjaan's orders, the bodies of the patrol were left untouched, though the whites' clothes and two of their facial skins were collected the next morning to serve as proof to Lobengula of the battle's outcome"", ' ""I had two sons killed that day,"" Ingubo warrior M\'Kotchwana later said, ""and my brother was shot in the stomach', ' The amakiwa [whites] were brave men; they were warriors', '""  Men of the Shangani Patrol Of the 43 men involved in Wilson\'s patrol (including the major himself), 37 were present when the battle began', ' This was reduced to 34 when Wilson ordered Burnham, Ingram and Gooding to break out', ' Those left behind were all killed in action', ' Though the men of the patrol came from several parts of the British Empire as well as other countries, most were born in Britain itself: Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Marshall Hole writes that of these ""over a dozen were English Public School and University men""', ' Wilson himself was originally Scottish, while Borrow was born in Cornwall', ' Also represented in the patrol were South Africa (several members, most prominently Captain William Judd), the United States (Burnham and Ingram), India (Troopers Dillon and Money), Canada (Scout Robert Bain), Australia (Gooding)

southern side of the Shangani was over, Forbes and his column conducted a cursory search for survivors from Wilson's party, but, unable to cross the river, could see nothing to tell them what had happened"", ' Guessing (correctly) that all Company men beyond the river had been killed, they turned and trekked back to Bulawayo in miserable fashion, their supplies all but gone and the Matabele impeding their progress at every turn', '  Matabele raiding parties attacked the retreating column six times during its two-week journey back to Bulawayo', ' In pouring rain, the dishevelled men were soon mostly on foot, existing off horse meat and wearing makeshift shoes made from ammunition wallets', ' Forbes felt so humiliated by the events that he retreated from command in all but name, surrendering de facto control to Commandant Raaff', ' In leading the column back to Bulawayo, Raaff repeatedly drew on his experience from the Anglo-Zulu War to ensure the survival of the haggard men', ' He avoided several Matabele ambushes, and at one point set up a convincing decoy camp that the Matabele fired on for half a day, wasting much of their ammunition', ""  On the column's inglorious return to Bulawayo on 18 December 1893, Forbes was received in muted disgrace"", ' The officers and men stood on parade for Cecil Rhodes, and the Company chief passed the major without a word', "" Raaff, on the other hand, was publicly commended by Rhodes, and thanked for ensuring the column's safe return"", ""  Meanwhile, Lobengula moved to the north-east, now well out of the company's reach for the foreseeable future"", ' However, his sickness, which turned out to be smallpox, sharply intensified and eventually killed him on 22 or 23 January 1894', ' With the king dead, Mjaan, the most senior of the izinDuna, took command of the Matabele', ' Mjaan was an old man, and his only son had been killed in the war', ' He wished to make peace', ' In late February 1894, he convened an indaba at which he and his contemporaries met with James Dawson, a trader known to them for many years, who offered the olive branch on behalf of the company', ' The izinDuna unanimously accepted', ' They also told the trader what had happened to the Shangani Patrol, and led him to the battle site to survey it, as well as to examine and identify the largely skeletonised bodies of the soldiers, which still lay where they had fallen', ' Dawson was the first non-Matabele to learn of the last stand', '  Cultural impact, burial and memorial [[File:Zimbabwe Shangani Memorial',

by the incident, Cheer, Boys, Cheer!, was written by Augustus Harris, Cecil Raleigh and Henry Hamilton, and staged at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, starting in September 1895', ' The show tells the story of a young colonial army officer in South Africa and Rhodesia, culminating in the third act with a fictionalised account of the First Matabele War', "" This itself climaxes with a scene strongly reminiscent of Wilson's last stand"", ' The production ran for nearly six months in London, and then toured the British provinces for more than two years,; ;  reportedly drawing large crowds', ' According to historian Neil Parsons, it contributed to the patrol ""fast gain[ing] mythological status""', '  In historical terms, the Shangani Patrol subsequently became an integral part of Rhodesian identity, with Wilson and Borrow in particular woven into the national tapestry as heroic figures symbolising duty in the face of insuperable odds', ';  Their last stand together became a kind of national myth, as Lewis Gann writes, ""a glorious memory, [Rhodesia\'s] own equivalent of the bloody Alamo massacre and Custer\'s Last Stand in the American West""', ' In 1895, 4 December was declared ""Shangani Day"", an annual Rhodesian public holiday which endured until 1920, when it was folded into Occupation Day, a national non-work day which commemorated several early colonial events together', ' Shangani Day remained part of the national calendar, however, and was still marked each year', ""  The remains of the patrol's members were buried on 14 August 1894, in the ruined city of Great Zimbabwe"", "" Rhodes later wrote into his will that he wished to have the patrol re-interred alongside him at World's View, in the Matopos Hills, when he died; this was done in 1904, two years after Rhodes's death"", "" Also according to Rhodes's wishes, a memorial to the Shangani Patrol was erected at World's View in July 1904, and dedicated by Bishop William Gaul of Mashonaland"", ' The monument, called the Shangani Memorial, is an oblong, flat-topped structure, about  tall and made from granite from a nearby kopje', ' It was designed by Herbert Baker, and based on the Pedestal of

Matabele messengers, Petchan and Sehuloholu, had been given a box of gold sovereigns by Lobengula, and instructed to intercept the column before it reached the river"", ' They were to tell the whites that the king admitted defeat and offered this tribute, totalling about £1,000, on the condition that the column immediately turn back and cease harassing him', ' ""Gold is the only thing that will stop the white men,"" Lobengula reportedly concluded', ' According to the inDuna, Petchan and Sehuloholu reached the column on 2 December 1893, the day before it reached the Shangani, and hid in the bush as it went by', ' They then caught up with it and gave the money and the message to two men in the rear guard', '  [[File:Sovereign Victoria 1842 662015', 'jpg|thumb|left|Gold sovereigns bearing

Company authorities made enquiries', ' No man who had been attached to the column corroborated the account', ' The Company thought it unlikely that a Matabele inDuna would simply invent a story such as this, however, and angrily speculated that if it were true, then negotiations with Lobengula might have been opened and the war ended before Wilson crossed the river, and the entire episode of the Shangani Patrol avoided (though, as historian Robert Cary writes, this surmision ignores the fact that Forbes had been ordered to capture Lobengula, not end the war)', ' Lawyers appointed by the company launched a formal investigation early in 1894', ""  Two officers' batmen, William Charles Daniel and James Wilson (no relation to Allan Wilson), soon became prime suspects, with Daniel arraigned as the senior instigator"", ' They were accused of accepting the gold from Petchan and Sehuloholu, then keeping it for themselves and not passing on the message', ' Both men denied all charges', ' Neither Daniel nor Wilson had been members of the rear guard on 2 December, though either or both could have been there at some point during the day', ' No Matabele witness recognised either of them at the court in Bulawayo, where the case was heard by the Resident Magistrate and four assessors', ""  The evidence against the batmen was largely circumstantial: both had been seen to possess unusually large amounts of gold soon after the column's return, and both had since bought farming rights, paying cash"", ' Daniel said he had won the money in his possession playing cards, while Wilson claimed to have brought his with him when he came to Rhodesia', ' Witnesses confirmed that there had been heavy gambling at Inyati camp, in which Daniel and Wilson had actively taken part, both possessing noticeable reserves in gold sovereigns', ' Sehuloholu claimed in his statement that both of the men he had met in the rear guard had fluently and perfectly spoken to him in Sindebele, but neither of the accused men knew the language, and the only member of the column who did at a fluent level was a medical orderly who had never been near the rear guard', ' The prosecutor

boys though it had been set up with the view of it becoming a multiracial international school', ',  The founders had seen the winds of change sweeping across Africa and felt they had to provide high quality education, equivalent to what Europeans were receiving, for the future leaders of an independent Rhodesia', ' The whole idea behind the school was to bring up well-rounded African leaders in areas of finance, industry, business, education, medicine, law, military and politics', ' Rt', ' Reverend Cecil Alderson, like his predecessor Bishop Edward Paget,  realised the need for a senior college for Africans had become increasingly urgent, and within a few weeks of his translation from the Bloemfontein Diocese, Bishop Alderson began to investigate ways of meeting it', ' At the same

registered in the United Kingdom in July 1962 under trust number 313889', ' A pledge of forty thousand pounds was then made to Bishop Alderson at the Lambeth Conference in London so that the project could be realized', ' A significant chunk of that money is believed to have come from the Beit Trust and then anonymous individuals well wishers banks and corporates', ""  It was intended to be a multiracial, elite boys' school, an 'African Eton', and was strongly supported by the Anglican Church and a number of Federation businesses"", ' With the support of the Governor General of The

no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments, much to the Rhodesian government's indignation"", '  Talks between Nkomo and Prime Minister Ian Smith, which had been progressing promisingly, were immediately suspended by the Rhodesians, with Smith calling Nkomo a ""monster""', ' On 10 September, Smith announced the extension of martial law over selected areas', ' The Rhodesian Security Forces launched several retaliatory strikes into Zambia and Mozambique over the following months, attacking both ZIPRA and its rival, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA)', ' The attack on

independence before majority rule"" had recently gained ground in Britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation, and Rhodesia\'s government was dominated by the country\'s white minority, so the unilateral declaration went unrecognised internationally', ' Britain and the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia', ""  Two rival communist-backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule: the Chinese-aligned Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), mostly comprising Shonas, created the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and adopted aspects of Maoist doctrine, while the Ndebele-dominated Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), aligned with Soviet-style Marxism–Leninism and the Warsaw Pact, mobilised the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA)"", ';   These guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the ""Second Chimurenga"" against the Rhodesian government and security forces', ' The resulting conflict, the Rhodesian Bush War, began in earnest in December 1972, when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms in north-eastern Rhodesia', ""  After the security forces mounted a successful counter-insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974, developments overseas caused the conflict's momentum to shift in the insurgents' favour"", "" The leftist Carnation Revolution of April 1974 caused Portugal to withdraw its key economic support for Smith's administration, and led to Mozambique's independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with ZANU"", "" Around the same time, Rhodesia's other main backer, South Africa, adopted a détente initiative that forced a ceasefire, giving the guerrillas time to regroup"", ' Following the abortive Victoria Falls Conference of August 1975, Smith and the ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo held unsuccessful talks between December 1975 and March 1976', ' ZANU and ZAPU announced in October 1976, during the run-up to the unsuccessful Geneva Conference in December, that they would henceforth attend conferences as a joint ""Patriotic Front""', '  In March 1978, Smith and non-militant nationalist groups headed by Bishop Abel Muzorewa, the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole and Chief Jeremiah Chirau agreed what became the ""Internal Settlement""', ' This created a joint black–white transitional government, with the country due to be reconstituted as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, pursuant to multiracial elections', ' ZANU and ZAPU were invited to participate, but refused; Nkomo sardonically dubbed Smith\'s black colleagues ""the blacksmiths""', ' ZANU proclaimed 1978 to be ""The Year of the People"" as the war continued', "" Officials from Muzorewa's United African National Council, sent to the provinces to explain the Internal Settlement to rural blacks, were killed by Marxist–Leninist guerrillas"", ' Insurgents also began to target Christian missionaries, climaxing in the killing of nine British missionaries and four children at Elim Mission near the Mozambican border in the Vumba massacre on 23 June', '  The transitional government was badly received abroad, partly because the

worked to bring Nkomo into the government, hoping this would lend it some credence domestically, prompt diplomatic recognition overseas, and help the security forces defeat ZANLA', ' Starting on 14

settler population', ' The CAF sought to emulate the experience of Australia, Canada and South Africa – wherein groups of colonies had been federated together to form viable independent nations', ' Originally designed to be ""an indissoluble federation"", the CAF quickly started to unravel due to the low proportion of British and other white citizens in relation to the larger black populations', ' Additionally, by incorporating the tribes within the Federation as potential citizens, the Federation created the paradoxical situation of having a white elite owning most of the land and capital,

of these were relatively new to the region, were primarily in the extraction business, had little landed interests, and were more amenable to allowing black nationalism than the Southern Rhodesians', ' Accordingly, Britain granted independence to Northern Rhodesia on 24 October 1964', ' However, when the new nationalists changed its name to Zambia and began tentatively at first and later in rapid march an Africanisation campaign, Southern Rhodesia remained a British colony, resisting attempts to bring in majority rule', ' The colony attempted to change its name to Rhodesia although this was

the three member states (due to its vast copper mines) and had contributed more to the overall building of infrastructure than the other two members did', ' Southern Rhodesia, recognising an inevitable dissolution of the Federation, was quick to use federal funds in building its infrastructure ahead of the others', ' A key component of this was the building of the Kariba Dam and its hydroelectric facility (shafts, control centre, etc', '), which was situated on the Southern Rhodesian side of the Zambezi Gorge', ' This situation caused some embarrassment for the Zambian government later when it was a ""front line state"" in support of insurgents into Rhodesia in that its major source of electric power was controlled by the Rhodesian state', '  Return to ""Rhodesia""  With the

the 15th century, the Bakalanga/vakaranga had established a strong empire at Khami under a powerful ruler called Dlembeu', ' This empire was split by the end of the 15th century and were later

1840, Matabeleland was founded', '  In 1852, the Boer government in the Transvaal made a treaty with Mzilikazi', ' Gold was discovered in northern Ndebele in 1867', ' The area, settled by the Zezuru

succeeded him as king', "" In exchange for wealth and arms, Lobengula granted several concessions to the British, but it was not until twenty years later that the most prominent of these, the 1888

in 1889 to obtain a Royal Charter to form the British South Africa Company', '  British South Africa Company  In 1890, Rhodes sent a group of settlers, known as the Pioneer Column, into Mashonaland

of white settlements in the region, so now with the cover of a legal mandate, he used a brutal attack by Ndebele against the Shona near Fort Victoria (now Masvingo) in 1893 as a pretext for attacking the kingdom of Lobengula', ' Also in 1893, a concession awarded to Sir John Swinburne was detached from Matabeleland to be administered by the British Resident Commissioner of the Bechuanaland

The Maxim machine guns took center stage and decimated the native force at the Battle of the Shangani', ""  Although Lobengula's forces totaled 8,000 spearmen and 2,000 riflemen, versus fewer than 700 soldiers of the British South Africa Police, the Ndebele warriors were not equipped to match the British machine guns"", ' Leander Starr Jameson sent his troops to Bulawayo to try to capture Lobengula, but the king escaped and left Bulawayo in ruins behind him', '  An attempt to bring the king and his forces to submit led to the disaster of the Shangani Patrol when a Ndebele Impi defeated a British South Africa Company patrol led by Major Allan Wilson at the Shangani river in December 1893', ' Except for Frederick Russell Burnham and two other scouts sent for reinforcements, the detachment was surrounded and wiped out', ' This incident had a lasting influence on Matabeleland nationalism and spirit of resistance and the colonists who died in this battle are buried at Matobo Hills along with Jameson and Cecil Rhodes', "" In white Rhodesian history, Wilson's battle takes on the status of General Custer's stand at Little Big Horn in the United States"", ' The Matabele fighters honoured the dead men with a salute to their bravery in battle and reportedly told the king, ""They were men of men and their fathers were men before them', '""  Lobengula died in January 1894, under mysterious circumstances; within a few short months the British South Africa Company controlled Matabeleland, and white settlers continued to arrive', '  Second Matebele War  In March

Ndebele spiritual/religious leader, is credited with fomenting much of the anger that led to this confrontation', ' He convinced the Ndebele that the white settlers (almost 4,000 strong by then) were

the American scout Frederick Russell Burnham, Cecil Rhodes walked unarmed into the Ndebele stronghold in Matobo Hills and persuaded the impi to lay down their arms, thus bringing the war to a close in

already, in 1884, published a book called ""Reconnaissance and Scouting""', ' In mid-June 1896, while scouting in the Matobo Hills, Burnham passed on to Baden-Powell aspects of woodcraft he had acquired in America, and it was during this time with Burnham that perhaps the seeds were sown for the program and the code of honour eventually crystallised in Baden-Powell\'s 1899 ""Aids to Scouting for NCOs and Men"" and his later (1908) ""Scouting for Boys"", which was written after his experience of how useful and reliable the boys at Mafeking had been', ' Practiced by frontiersmen of the American Old West and Indigenous peoples of the Americas, woodcraft was generally unknown to the British', ' These skills eventually formed the basis of what is now called scoutcraft, the fundamentals of Scouting', ' Baden-Powell recognised that wars in Africa were changing markedly and the British Army needed to adapt; so during their joint scouting missions, Baden-Powell and Burnham discussed the concept of a broad training programme in woodcraft for young men, rich in exploration, tracking, fieldcraft, and self-reliance', ' It was also during these scouting missions in the Matobo Hills that Baden-Powell first started to wear his signature campaign hat like the one worn by Burnham', ' Later, Baden-Powell wrote a number of books on Scouting, and even started to train and make use of adolescent boys, most famously during the Siege of Mafeking, during the Second Boer War', '  British Rule  British settlement of Rhodesia continued, and by October 1923, the territory of Southern Rhodesia was annexed to the Crown', ' The Ndebele thereby became British subjects and the colony received its first basic constitution and first parliamentary election', "" Ten years later, the British South Africa Company ceded its mineral rights to the territory's government for £2 million"", '  The deep recession of the 1930s gave way to a post-war boom of British immigration', '  After the onset of self-government, a major issue in Southern Rhodesia was the relationship between the white settlers and the Ndebele and Shona populations', ' One major consequence was the white settlers were able to enact discriminatory legislation concerning land tenure', ' The Land Apportionment and Tenure Acts reserved 45% of the land area for exclusively white ownership', ' 25% was designated ""Tribal Trust Land"", which was available to be worked on a collective basis by the already settled farmers and where individual title was not offered', '  In 1965, the white government of Rhodesia, led by Prime Minister Ian Smith, unilaterally declared independence from Britain — only the second state to do so, the other being the United States in 1776', ' Initially, the state proclaimed its loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II as ""Queen of Rhodesia"" (a title to which she never consented), but by 1970 even that link was severed, and Rhodesia claimed to be an independent republic', ' This was not recognised by any other state in the world; legally, Rhodesia remained a British colony', '  Sovereign Rhodesia  The ruling white Rhodesian government did not gain international recognition and faced serious economic problems as a result of sanctions', ' Some states, such as South Africa and Portugal, did support the white minority government of Rhodesia', ' In 1967, the Zimbabwe African

self-governing colony of Rhodesia led the colonial government, headed by Prime Minister Ian Smith, to unilaterally declare independence from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965', ' The idea of ""no independence before majority rule"" had recently gained ground in Britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation, and Rhodesia\'s government was dominated by the country\'s white minority, so the unilateral declaration went unrecognised internationally', ' Britain and the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia', ""  Two rival communist-backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule: the Chinese-aligned Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), mostly comprising Shonas, created the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and adopted aspects of Maoist doctrine, while the Ndebele-dominated Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), aligned with Soviet-style Marxism–Leninism and the Warsaw Pact, mobilised the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA)"", ';   These guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the ""Second Chimurenga"" against the Rhodesian government and security forces', ' The resulting conflict, the Rhodesian Bush War, began in earnest in December 1972, when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms in north-eastern Rhodesia', ""  After the security forces mounted a successful counter-insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974, developments overseas caused the conflict's momentum to shift in the insurgents' favour"", "" The leftist Carnation Revolution of April 1974 caused Portugal to withdraw its key economic support for Smith's administration, and led to Mozambique's independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with ZANU"", "" Around the same time, Rhodesia's other main backer, South Africa, adopted a détente initiative that forced a ceasefire, giving the guerrillas time to regroup"", ' Following the abortive Victoria Falls Conference of August 1975, Smith and the ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo held unsuccessful talks between December 1975 and March 1976', ' ZANU and ZAPU announced in October 1976, during the run-up to the unsuccessful Geneva Conference in December, that they would henceforth attend conferences as a joint ""Patriotic Front""', '  In March 1978, Smith and non-militant nationalist groups headed by Bishop Abel Muzorewa, the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole and Chief Jeremiah Chirau agreed what became the ""Internal Settlement""', ' This created a joint black–white transitional government, with the country due to be reconstituted as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, pursuant to multiracial elections', ' ZANU and ZAPU were invited to participate, but refused; Nkomo sardonically dubbed Smith\'s black colleagues ""the blacksmiths""', ' ZANU proclaimed 1978 to be ""The Year of the People"" as the war continued', "" Officials from Muzorewa's United African National Council, sent to the provinces to explain the Internal Settlement to rural blacks, were killed by Marxist–Leninist guerrillas"", ' Insurgents also began to target Christian missionaries, climaxing in the killing of nine British missionaries and four children at Elim Mission near the Mozambican border in the Vumba massacre on 23 June', '  The transitional government was badly received abroad, partly because the Internal Settlement kept control of law enforcement, the military, the judiciary and the civil service under white control', "" No country recognised Rhodesia's interim administration"", ' Smith again worked to bring Nkomo into the government, hoping this would lend it some credence domestically, prompt diplomatic recognition overseas, and help the security forces defeat ZANLA', ' Starting on 14 August 1978, he attended secret meetings with Nkomo in Lusaka, Zambia (where ZAPU was based), doing so with the assistance of the mining corporation Lonrho', ' Attempts were made to also involve the ZANU leader Robert Mugabe, but Mugabe would have no part in the talks', ' According to the South African military historian Jakkie Cilliers, negotiations between Smith and Nkomo progressed well and ""seemed on the verge of success"" by the start of September 1978', ' On 2 September, Smith and Nkomo revealed publicly that the secret meetings had taken place', '  Incident  Prior threats to

seriously threatened until about 1977, in the latter stages of the war; before this time, neither revolutionary force had the weapons to launch a viable attack against an aerial target', "" The weapon that made such attacks feasible for ZIPRA was the Strela-2 shoulder-launched surface-to-air missile launcher, supplied by the Soviet Union from the mid-1970s as part of the Warsaw Pact's materiel

flowed between Lake Kariba and the Rhodesian capital Salisbury', '  The Hunyani was on the second and final leg of its regular scheduled journey between Victoria Falls and Salisbury, stopping over in the resort town of Kariba', "" Despite the occasional rocket and mortar attacks launched on Kariba by ZIPRA guerrillas on the northern side of the Zambezi (in Zambia), the resort had endured as one of Rhodesia's choice tourist destinations"", ' The flight on 3 September 1978, Sunday afternoon, from Kariba to Salisbury carried four crew members and 52 passengers, most of whom were holidaymakers from Salisbury, returning home after a weekend at the lake', ' The flight took off from Kariba Airport on schedule soon after 17:00 Central Africa Time', '  Flight 825 was piloted by 36-year-old Captain

plane's starboard wing and exploded, causing the inner engine to also explode"", ' A fuel tank and hydraulic lines ruptured, creating a fire that could not be put out', ' The second starboard engine failed almost immediately, leaving Hood with only his two port engines', ' Heaving wildly, the Hunyani began to descend rapidly', '  At 17:10 Captain Hood sent a distress call to air traffic control, informing them that he had lost the two starboard engines and was going to crash', ' ""We\'re going in,"" he radioed', ' Telling his passengers to brace for an emergency landing, he aimed for an open field of cotton in the Whamira Hills, in the bush to the west of Karoi, intending to belly land the craft', ' The landing was relatively stable until the Hunyani hit a ditch, cartwheeled and exploded', ' The remaining fuel tanks ruptured and caught fire, setting the wrecked cabin ablaze', '  Massacre on the ground Of the 56 people on board, 38, including Hood and Beaumont, died in the crash', ' Eighteen survived, albeit with injuries, and climbed out of the wreckage', ' After briefly settling the others, one of the passengers, Cecil MacLaren, led four others—young newlyweds Robert and Shannon Hargreaves, Sharon Coles, and her four-year-old daughter Tracey—off in the direction of a nearby village in search of water', ' The other 13 remained close to the wreckage', ' Meanwhile, nine guerrillas made their way towards the crash site, and reached it at about 17:45', ' Three of the 13 survivors remaining at the crash site hid on seeing figures approaching: Rhodesian Army reservist Anthony Hill, 39, took cover in the surrounding bush, while businessman Hans Hansen and his wife Diana did the same', ' This left 10 passengers in full view near the wreckage, including four women and two girls (aged 11 and 4)', '  The guerrillas, who were armed with AK-47 rifles, presented themselves to the 10 passengers as friendly, saying they would summon help and bring water', ' They spoke in English, both to the survivors and among themselves', ' They told the passengers to congregate around a point a few metres from the wreckage; when the survivors said that some of them were too badly injured to walk, the insurgents told the able-bodied men to carry the others', ' The passengers were assembled into an area of about ', ' Standing roughly  away, the cadres now raised their weapons', ' ""You have taken our land,"" one of them said', ' ""Please don\'t shoot us!"" one of the passengers cried, just before they were killed by a sustained burst of automatic gunfire', '  Those that survived the initial bursts were bayoneted (including a mother and her 3-week-old baby)', '  Having collected water from the nearby village, MacLaren and his companions were almost back at the crash site when they heard the shots', ' Thinking it was personal ammunition in the luggage exploding in the heat, they continued on their way, and called out to the other passengers, who they thought were still alive', ' This alerted the insurgents to the presence of more survivors; one of the guerrillas told MacLaren\'s group to ""come here""', ' The insurgents then opened fire on their general location, prompting MacLaren and the others to flee', ' Hill and the Hansens also ran; they revealed their positions to the fighters in their haste, but successfully hid themselves behind a ridge', ' After Hill and the others had hidden there for about two hours, they saw the attackers return to the crash site at about 19:45', "" The guerrillas looted the wrecked cabin and some of the suitcases strewn around the site, filled their arms with passengers' belongings, then left again"", '  The survivors were found over the following days by the Rhodesian Army and police; Hill and the Hansens were taken to Kariba Hospital, while MacLaren and his group were airlifted to Andrew Fleming Hospital in Salisbury', ""  Nkomo claims responsibility, but denies killing survivors Nkomo claimed

wicked massacre shocked the entire nation and the world', ' Black and white united in condemnation of the shooting down of Flight 825 and the senseless loss of innocent lives', ' Reports that ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo had laughed about the incident when interviewed on television by the BBC were met with utter revulsion', '"" He said that he had received intelligence that the Hunyani was being used for military purposes', "" Nkomo said he regretted the deaths as it was not his party's policy to kill civilians, and denied that his men had killed any survivors on the ground; by contrast, he said that his men had helped them, and had left them alive"", ' He also accused Air Rhodesia of surreptitiously hauling troops and war materiel for the government, an allegation that Captain Pat Travers, Air Rhodesia\'s general manager, called a ""downright, deliberate lie""', '  According to Eliakim Sibanda, a professor and human rights speaker who wrote a history of ZAPU, Nkomo was implying that responsibility for the massacre lay with security force pseudo-guerrillas, more specifically the Selous Scouts unit, which had often been accused of brutalising rural civilians with the goal of shifting public opinion', ' Sibanda asserts that the massacre ""cannot be put beyond"" the Scouts, and also supports Nkomo\'s claim that the Hunyani had been used militarily, suggesting that ZIPRA might have believed there to be Rhodesian soldiers on board', ' ""Rhodesian television, before attacks on ZANLA in Mozambique, had shown Viscounts ferrying paratroopers for the job,"" he writes, ""',

Church in the then Rhodesia through a deed of trust drafted in 1958 and registered on 29 May 1959 at Harare', ' The college was established predominantly for African boys however over the years there were girls who attended the college', '  Foundation The school was founded by a group of prominent individuals of both European and African races and both sexes to be a leading high school for African boys though it had been set up with the view of it becoming a multiracial international school', ',  The founders had seen the winds of change sweeping across Africa and felt they had to provide high quality education, equivalent to what Europeans were receiving, for the future leaders of an independent Rhodesia', ' The whole idea behind the school was to bring up well-rounded African leaders in areas of finance, industry, business, education, medicine, law, military and politics', ' Rt', ' Reverend Cecil Alderson, like his predecessor Bishop Edward Paget,  realised the need for a senior college for Africans had become increasingly urgent, and within a few weeks of his translation from the Bloemfontein Diocese, Bishop Alderson began to investigate ways of meeting it', ' At the same

registered in the United Kingdom in July 1962 under trust number 313889', ' A pledge of forty thousand pounds was then made to Bishop Alderson at the Lambeth Conference in London so that the project could be realized', ' A significant chunk of that money is believed to have come from the Beit Trust and then anonymous individuals well wishers banks and corporates', ""  It was intended to be a multiracial, elite boys' school, an 'African Eton', and was strongly supported by the Anglican Church and a number of Federation businesses"", ' With the support of the Governor General of The

no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments, much to the Rhodesian government's indignation"", '  Talks between Nkomo and Prime Minister Ian Smith, which had been progressing promisingly, were immediately suspended by the Rhodesians, with Smith calling Nkomo a ""monster""', ' On 10 September, Smith announced the extension of martial law over selected areas', ' The Rhodesian Security Forces launched several retaliatory strikes into Zambia and Mozambique over the following months, attacking both ZIPRA and its rival, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA)', ' The attack on

independence before majority rule"" had recently gained ground in Britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation, and Rhodesia\'s government was dominated by the country\'s white minority, so the unilateral declaration went unrecognised internationally', ' Britain and the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia', ""  Two rival communist-backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule: the Chinese-aligned Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), mostly comprising Shonas, created the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and adopted aspects of Maoist doctrine, while the Ndebele-dominated Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), aligned with Soviet-style Marxism–Leninism and the Warsaw Pact, mobilised the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA)"", ';   These guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the ""Second Chimurenga"" against the Rhodesian government and security forces', ' The resulting conflict, the Rhodesian Bush War, began in earnest in December 1972, when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms in north-eastern Rhodesia', ""  After the security forces mounted a successful counter-insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974, developments overseas caused the conflict's momentum to shift in the insurgents' favour"", "" The leftist Carnation Revolution of April 1974 caused Portugal to withdraw its key economic support for Smith's administration, and led to Mozambique's independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with ZANU"", "" Around the same time, Rhodesia's other main backer, South Africa, adopted a détente initiative that forced a ceasefire, giving the guerrillas time to regroup"", ' Following the abortive Victoria Falls Conference of August 1975, Smith and the ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo held unsuccessful talks between December 1975 and March 1976', ' ZANU and ZAPU announced in October 1976, during the run-up to the unsuccessful Geneva Conference in December, that they would henceforth attend conferences as a joint ""Patriotic Front""', '  In March 1978, Smith and non-militant nationalist groups headed by Bishop Abel Muzorewa, the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole and Chief Jeremiah Chirau agreed what became the ""Internal Settlement""', ' This created a joint black–white transitional government, with the country due to be reconstituted as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, pursuant to multiracial elections', ' ZANU and ZAPU were invited to participate, but refused; Nkomo sardonically dubbed Smith\'s black colleagues ""the blacksmiths""', ' ZANU proclaimed 1978 to be ""The Year of the People"" as the war continued', "" Officials from Muzorewa's United African National Council, sent to the provinces to explain the Internal Settlement to rural blacks, were killed by Marxist–Leninist guerrillas"", ' Insurgents also began to target Christian missionaries, climaxing in the killing of nine British missionaries and four children at Elim Mission near the Mozambican border in the Vumba massacre on 23 June', '  The transitional government was badly received abroad, partly because the Internal Settlement kept control of law enforcement, the military, the judiciary and the civil service under white control', "" No country recognised Rhodesia's interim administration"", ' Smith again worked to bring Nkomo into the government, hoping this would lend it some credence domestically, prompt diplomatic recognition overseas, and help the security forces defeat ZANLA', ' Starting on 14

Originally designed to be ""an indissoluble federation"", the CAF quickly started to unravel due to the low proportion of British and other white citizens in relation to the larger black populations',

' Accordingly, Britain granted independence to Northern Rhodesia on 24 October 1964', ' However, when the new nationalists changed its name to Zambia and began tentatively at first and later in rapid

inevitable dissolution of the Federation, was quick to use federal funds in building its infrastructure ahead of the others', ' A key component of this was the building of the Kariba Dam and its hydroelectric facility (shafts, control centre, etc', '), which was situated on the Southern Rhodesian side of the Zambezi Gorge', ' This situation caused some embarrassment for the Zambian government

'jpg|thumb|left|Battle between British soldiers and Matabele (Richard Caton Woodville)]] The first decisive battle was fought on 1 November 1893, when a laager was attacked on open ground near the Bembesi River by Imbizo and Ingubo regiments', ' The laager consisted of 670 British soldiers, 400 of whom were mounted along with a small force of native allies, and fought off the Imbizo and Ingubo forces, which were considered by Sir John Willoughby to number 1,700 warriors in all', ' The laager had with it small artillery: 5 Maxim guns, 2 seven-pounders, 1 Gardner gun, and 1 Hotchkiss gun', ' The Maxim machine guns took center stage and decimated the native force at the Battle of the Shangani', ""  Although Lobengula's forces totaled 8,000 spearmen and 2,000 riflemen, versus fewer than 700 soldiers of the British South Africa Police, the Ndebele warriors were not equipped to match the British machine guns"", ' Leander Starr Jameson sent his troops to Bulawayo to try to capture Lobengula, but the king escaped and left Bulawayo in ruins behind him', '  An attempt to bring the king and his forces to submit led to the disaster of the Shangani Patrol when a Ndebele Impi defeated a British South Africa Company patrol led by Major Allan Wilson at the Shangani river in December 1893', ' Except for Frederick Russell Burnham and two other scouts sent for reinforcements, the detachment was surrounded and wiped out', ' This incident had a lasting influence on Matabeleland nationalism and spirit of resistance and the colonists who died in this battle are buried at Matobo Hills along with Jameson and Cecil Rhodes', "" In white Rhodesian history, Wilson's battle takes on the status of General Custer's stand at Little Big Horn in the United States"", ' The Matabele fighters honoured the dead men with a salute to their bravery in battle and reportedly told the king, ""They were men of men and their fathers were men before them', '""  Lobengula died in January 1894, under mysterious circumstances; within a few short months the British South Africa Company controlled Matabeleland, and white settlers continued to arrive', '  Second Matebele War  In March 1896, the Ndebele revolted against the authority of the British South Africa Company in what is now celebrated in Zimbabwe as the First Chimurenga, i', 'e', ', First War of Independence', ' Mlimo, the Ndebele spiritual/religious leader, is credited with fomenting much of the anger that led to this confrontation', ' He convinced the Ndebele that the white settlers (almost 4,000 strong by then) were responsible for the drought, locust plagues and the cattle disease rinderpest ravaging the country at the time', ""  Mlimo's call to battle was well-timed"", "" Only a few months earlier, the British South Africa Company's Administrator General for Matabeleland, Leander Starr Jameson, had sent most of his troops and armaments to fight the Transvaal Republic in the ill-fated Jameson Raid"", "" This left the country's security in disarray"", ' In June 1896, the Shona too joined the war, but they stayed mostly on the defensive', ' The British would immediately send troops to suppress the Ndebele and the Shona, only it would take months and cost many hundreds of lives before the territory would be once again be at peace', ' Shortly after learning of the assassination of Mlimo at the hands of the American scout Frederick Russell Burnham, Cecil Rhodes walked unarmed into the Ndebele stronghold in Matobo Hills and persuaded the impi to lay down their arms, thus bringing the war to a close in

founder of the Scout Movement, and the younger Frederick Russell Burnham, the American born Chief of Scouts for the British Army, first met and began their lifelong friendship', ' Baden-Powell had already, in 1884, published a book called ""Reconnaissance and Scouting""', ' In mid-June 1896, while scouting in the Matobo Hills, Burnham passed on to Baden-Powell aspects of woodcraft he had acquired in America, and it was during this time with Burnham that perhaps the seeds were sown for the program and the code of honour eventually crystallised in Baden-Powell\'s 1899 ""Aids to Scouting for NCOs and Men"" and his later (1908) ""Scouting for Boys"", which was written after his experience of how useful and reliable the boys at Mafeking had been', ' Practiced by frontiersmen of the American Old West and Indigenous peoples of the Americas, woodcraft was generally unknown to the British', ' These skills eventually formed the basis of what is now called scoutcraft, the fundamentals of Scouting', ' Baden-Powell recognised that wars in Africa were changing markedly and the British Army needed to adapt; so during their joint scouting missions, Baden-Powell and Burnham discussed the concept of a broad training programme in woodcraft for young men, rich in exploration, tracking, fieldcraft, and self-reliance', ' It was also during these scouting missions in the Matobo Hills that Baden-Powell first started to wear his signature campaign hat like the one worn by Burnham', ' Later, Baden-Powell wrote a number of books on Scouting, and even started to train and make use of adolescent boys, most famously during the Siege of Mafeking, during the Second Boer War', '  British Rule  British settlement of Rhodesia continued, and by October 1923, the territory of Southern Rhodesia was annexed to the Crown', ' The Ndebele thereby became British subjects and the colony received its first basic constitution and first parliamentary election', "" Ten years later, the British South Africa Company ceded its mineral rights to the territory's government for £2 million"", '  The deep recession of the 1930s gave way to a post-war boom of British immigration', '  After the onset of self-government, a major issue in Southern Rhodesia was the relationship between the white settlers and the Ndebele and Shona populations', ' One major consequence was the white settlers were able to enact discriminatory legislation concerning land tenure', ' The Land Apportionment and Tenure Acts reserved 45% of the land area for exclusively white ownership', ' 25% was designated ""Tribal Trust Land"", which was available to be worked on a collective basis by the already settled farmers and where individual title was not offered', '  In 1965, the white government of Rhodesia, led by Prime Minister Ian Smith, unilaterally declared independence from Britain — only the second state to do so, the other being the United States in 1776', ' Initially, the state proclaimed its loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II as ""Queen of Rhodesia"" (a title to which she never consented), but by 1970 even that link was severed, and Rhodesia claimed to be an independent republic', ' This was not recognised by any other state in the world; legally, Rhodesia remained a British colony', '  Sovereign Rhodesia  The ruling white Rhodesian government did not gain international recognition and faced serious economic problems as a result of sanctions', ' Some states, such as South Africa and Portugal, did support the white minority government of Rhodesia', ' In 1967, the Zimbabwe African People\'s Union began a lengthy armed campaign against Rhodesia\'s white minority government in what became known as the ""Bush War"" by White Rhodesians and as the ""Second Umvukela"" (or rebellion in Ndebele language) by supporters of the rebels', ' The Shona, backed by China, set up a separate war front from neighbouring Mozambique', '  The Rhodesian government agreed to a ceasefire in 1979',

and much of the Ndebele population suffered food shortages', ' Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo finally reconciled their political differences by late 1987', "" The roots of discord remained, however, and in some ways increased as Mugabe's rule became increasingly autocratic into the 21st century"", '  In the early 1990s, a Land Acquisition Act was passed, calling for the Mugabe government to purchase mostly white-owned commercial farming land for redistribution to native Africans', ' Matabeleland has rich central plains, watered by tributaries of the Zambezi and Limpopo rivers, allowing it to sustain cattle and consistently produce large amounts of cotton and maize', "" But land grabbing, squatting, and repossessions of large commercial farms under Mugabe's program resulted in a 90%

War"", "" The aircraft involved, a Vickers Viscount named the Hunyani, was flying the last leg of Air Rhodesia's regular scheduled service from Victoria Falls to the capital Salisbury, via the resort town of Kariba"", '  Soon after Flight 825 took off, a group of ZIPRA guerrillas hit it on its starboard wing with a Soviet-made Strela-2 surface-to-air infrared homing missile, critically damaging the aircraft and forcing an emergency landing', ' An attempted belly landing in a cotton field just west of Karoi was foiled by a ditch, which caused the plane to cartwheel and break up', ' Of the 52 passengers and four crew, 38 died in the crash; the insurgents then approached the wreckage, rounded up the 10 survivors they could see and massacred them with automatic gunfire', ' Three passengers survived by hiding in the surrounding bush, while a further five lived because they had gone to look for water before the guerrillas arrived', ""  ZIPRA leader Joshua Nkomo publicly claimed responsibility for shooting down the Hunyani in an interview with the BBC's Today programme the next day, saying the aircraft had been used for military purposes, but denied that his men had killed survivors on the ground"", ' The majority of Rhodesians, both black and white, saw the attack as an act of terrorism', ' A fierce Rhodesian backlash followed against enemy strongholds and increased racial tension even though few black Rhodesians supported attacks of this kind', "" Reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as Time magazine, but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments, much to the Rhodesian government's indignation"", '  Talks between Nkomo and Prime Minister Ian Smith, which had been progressing promisingly, were immediately suspended by the Rhodesians, with Smith calling Nkomo a ""monster""', ' On 10 September, Smith announced the extension of martial law over selected areas', ' The Rhodesian Security Forces launched several retaliatory strikes into Zambia and Mozambique over the following months, attacking both ZIPRA and its rival, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA)', ' The attack on ZIPRA in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were refugees camping in and around guerrilla positions', ' In February 1979, ZIPRA shot down Air Rhodesia Flight 827, another civilian flight, in an almost identical incident', '  Background [[File:Zimbabwe in Africa', 'svg|thumb|upright|Rhodesia]] A dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty to the self-governing colony of Rhodesia led the colonial government, headed by Prime Minister Ian Smith, to unilaterally declare independence from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965', ' The idea of ""no independence before majority rule"" had recently gained ground in Britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation, and Rhodesia\'s government was dominated by the country\'s white minority, so the unilateral declaration went unrecognised internationally', ' Britain and the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia', ""  Two rival communist-backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule: the Chinese-aligned Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), mostly comprising Shonas, created the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and adopted aspects of Maoist doctrine, while the Ndebele-dominated Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), aligned with Soviet-style Marxism–Leninism and the Warsaw Pact, mobilised the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA)"", ';   These guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the ""Second Chimurenga"" against the Rhodesian government and security forces', ' The resulting conflict, the Rhodesian Bush War, began in earnest in December 1972, when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms in north-eastern Rhodesia', ""  After the security forces mounted a successful counter-insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974, developments overseas caused the conflict's momentum to shift in the insurgents' favour"", "" The leftist Carnation Revolution of April 1974 caused Portugal to withdraw its key economic support for Smith's administration, and led to Mozambique's independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with ZANU"", "" Around the same time, Rhodesia's other main backer, South Africa, adopted a détente initiative that forced a ceasefire, giving the guerrillas time to regroup"", ' Following the abortive Victoria Falls Conference of August 1975, Smith and the ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo held unsuccessful talks between December 1975 and March 1976', ' ZANU and ZAPU announced in October 1976, during the run-up to the unsuccessful Geneva Conference in December, that they would henceforth attend conferences as a joint ""Patriotic Front""', '  In March 1978, Smith and non-militant nationalist groups headed by Bishop Abel Muzorewa, the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole and Chief Jeremiah Chirau agreed what became the ""Internal Settlement""', ' This created a joint black–white transitional government, with the country due to be reconstituted as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, pursuant to multiracial elections', ' ZANU and ZAPU were invited to participate, but refused; Nkomo sardonically dubbed Smith\'s black colleagues ""the blacksmiths""', ' ZANU proclaimed 1978 to be ""The Year of the People"" as the war continued', "" Officials from Muzorewa's United African National Council, sent to the provinces to explain the Internal Settlement to rural blacks, were killed by Marxist–Leninist guerrillas"", ' Insurgents also began to target Christian missionaries, climaxing in the killing of nine British missionaries and four children at Elim Mission near the Mozambican border in the Vumba massacre on 23 June', '  The transitional government was badly received abroad, partly because the Internal Settlement kept control of law enforcement, the military, the judiciary and the civil service under white control', "" No country recognised Rhodesia's interim administration"", ' Smith again worked to bring Nkomo into the government, hoping this would lend it some credence domestically, prompt diplomatic recognition overseas, and help the security forces defeat ZANLA', ' Starting on 14 August 1978, he attended secret meetings with Nkomo in Lusaka, Zambia (where ZAPU was based), doing so with the assistance of the mining corporation Lonrho', ' Attempts were made to also involve the ZANU leader Robert Mugabe, but Mugabe would have no part in the talks', ' According to the South African military historian Jakkie Cilliers, negotiations between Smith and Nkomo progressed well and ""seemed on the verge of success"" by the start of September 1978', ' On 2 September, Smith and Nkomo revealed publicly that the secret meetings had taken place', '  Incident  Prior threats to

plane's starboard wing and exploded, causing the inner engine to also explode"", ' A fuel tank and hydraulic lines ruptured, creating a fire that could not be put out', ' The second starboard engine failed almost immediately, leaving Hood with only his two port engines', ' Heaving wildly, the Hunyani began to descend rapidly', '  At 17:10 Captain Hood sent a distress call to air traffic control, informing them that he had lost the two starboard engines and was going to crash', ' ""We\'re going in,"" he radioed', ' Telling his passengers to brace for an emergency landing, he aimed for an open field of cotton in the Whamira Hills, in the bush to the west of Karoi, intending to belly land the craft', ' The landing was relatively stable until the Hunyani hit a ditch, cartwheeled and exploded', ' The remaining fuel tanks ruptured and caught fire, setting the wrecked cabin ablaze', '  Massacre on the ground Of the 56 people on board, 38, including Hood and Beaumont, died in the

nine guerrillas made their way towards the crash site, and reached it at about 17:45', ' Three of the 13 survivors remaining at the crash site hid on seeing figures approaching: Rhodesian Army reservist Anthony Hill, 39, took cover in the surrounding bush, while businessman Hans Hansen and his wife Diana did the same', ' This left 10 passengers in full view near the wreckage, including four women and two girls (aged 11 and 4)', '  The guerrillas, who were armed with AK-47 rifles, presented themselves to the 10 passengers as friendly, saying they would summon help and bring water', ' They spoke in English, both to the survivors and among themselves', ' They told the passengers to congregate around a point a few metres from the wreckage; when the survivors said that some of them were too badly injured to walk, the insurgents told the able-bodied men to carry the others', ' The passengers were assembled into an area of about ', ' Standing roughly  away, the cadres now raised their weapons', ' ""You have taken our land,"" one of them said', ' ""Please don\'t shoot us!"" one of the passengers cried, just before they were killed by a sustained burst of automatic gunfire', '  Those that survived the initial bursts were bayoneted (including a mother and her 3-week-old baby)', '  Having collected water from the nearby village, MacLaren and his companions were almost back at the crash site when they heard the shots', ' Thinking it was personal ammunition in the luggage exploding in the heat, they continued on their way, and called out to the other passengers, who they thought were still alive', ' This alerted the insurgents to the presence of more survivors; one of the guerrillas told MacLaren\'s group to ""come here""', ' The insurgents then opened fire on their general location, prompting MacLaren and the others to flee', ' Hill and the Hansens also ran; they revealed their positions to the fighters in their haste, but successfully hid themselves behind a ridge', '

that responsibility for the massacre lay with security force pseudo-guerrillas, more specifically the Selous Scouts unit, which had often been accused of brutalising rural civilians with the goal of shifting public opinion', ' Sibanda asserts that the massacre ""cannot be put beyond"" the Scouts, and also supports Nkomo\'s claim that the Hunyani had been used militarily, suggesting that ZIPRA

company would govern and develop any territory it acquired, while respecting laws enacted by extant African rulers, and upholding free trade within its borders', ' The first settlers referred to their new home as ""Rhodesia"", after Rhodes', ' Though the company made good on most of its pledges, the assent of Lobengula and other native leaders, particularly regarding mining rights, was often evaded, misrepresented or simply ignored', ' It also offended Lobengula by demanding that he stop the customary Matabele raids on the Mashona people who inhabited the white-governed areas', "" Angered by the company's attitude towards his authority, Lobengula made war on the new arrivals and the Mashonas in 1893"", ' Matabele warriors began the wholesale slaughter of Mashonas in the vicinity of Fort Victoria in July that year, and an indaba (tribal conference) organised by Company official Leander Starr Jameson to end the conflict ended with violence, and dispersion by force', ' The First

Shangani River', ' Lobengula\'s troops were well-drilled and formidable by pre-colonial African standards, but the company\'s Maxim guns, which had never before been used in battle, far exceeded expectations, according to an eyewitness ""mow[ing] them down literally like grass""', ' By the time the Matabele withdrew, they had suffered around 1,500 fatalities; the company, on the other hand, had lost only four men', "" A week later, on 1 November, 2,000 Matabele riflemen and 4,000 warriors attacked Forbes at Bembezi, about  north-east of Bulawayo, but again they were no match for the crushing firepower of the major's Maxims: about 2,500 more Matabele were killed"", '  Lobengula fled Bulawayo as soon as he heard the news from Bembezi', ' On 3 November 1893, with the column on the outskirts of the city, he and his subjects left, torching the royal town as they went', "" In the resultant conflagration, the city's large store of ivory, gold and other treasure was destroyed, as

almost as soon as the blaze was out, with a new white-run city rising atop the ruins of Lobengula's former residence"", ' Jameson, who now based himself in Bulawayo, wrote the following letter to the Matabele king on 7 November 1893, in English, Dutch and Zulu:  This letter, carried by John Grootboom, a coloured man from the Cape, reached Lobengula near Shiloh Mission, about  north of Bulawayo', ' The king replied in English:  Jameson did not regard this ambiguity as a proper answer, and impatiently waited for further word from the king', ' After standing by for the specified two days and receiving nothing, he correctly concluded that Lobengula was stalling him, and using the extra time to distance himself from his former capital', "" Jameson therefore made good on his pledge, and called for volunteers; he assembled a host of about 470 men, mixed together from the Mashonaland Mounted Police, the Bechuanaland Border Police, and Raaff's Rangers, an independent unit led by the eponymous Commandant Piet Raaff"", "" This force was placed under Forbes's command, with three Maxim guns attached"", ' Jameson told the major to scout the area between Shiloh and Inyati for spoor,

left Bulawayo heading north, and, in an attempt to expedite its progress, reorganised itself into a more compact 290-man force at Shiloh"", ' Lobengula, meanwhile, rode north towards the Shangani in his wagon, which left obvious tracks in its wake', "" Following the wagon tracks, Forbes's men were soon hot on the trail, routinely finding recently abandoned Matabele camps, provisions and stragglers"", ' Heavy rain slowed both the king and his pursuers, and led Forbes to split his force again; moving on with a flying column of 160 men, he sent the rest back with the wagons', ' He pushed on, and on 3 December 1893 reached the southern bank of the Shangani, from where he could clearly see Matabele hastily driving cattle behind an impi (regiment) of warriors', ' The presence of smouldering fires beside the native column betrayed the fact that they had just crossed', ' Wishing to know whether the king had crossed here or at another point on the river, Forbes sent Major Allan Wilson across to scout ahead with 12 men and eight officers, and told him to return by nightfall', '  Meanwhile, Forbes formed a laager (improvised fort) about  from the southern bank', ' There, he interrogated a captive Matabele, the son of an inDuna (tribal leader), who said that the king was indeed where Wilson had gone, and was ill (the exact ailment was not known for sure, the prisoner said, but was suspected to be gout)', ' The inDunas son said that Lobengula had with him a force of about 3,000 warriors, about half of whom were armed with Martini–Henry rifles', "" They were mixed together from various regiments of the previously routed Matabele army, and largely demoralised, but still fiercely determined to prevent Lobengula's capture"", "" Most prominent were the Imbezu, Ingubo and Insukameni Regiments; the Imbezu, Lobengula's favourite, was generally considered the strongest"", "" After three weeks in pursuit of the king, Forbes's rations were running perilously short"", ' He therefore resolved to attack the next day (4 December), hoping to be able to turn back for Bulawayo with Lobengula in custody before nightfall', ""  Wilson's men remained north of the river far longer than expected, and had still not returned when darkness fell"", "" Forbes, meanwhile, received a report that most of Lobengula's force, commanded by inDuna Mjaan, had separated from the king and was moving to attack the laager the same night (this was actually an exaggeration; only about 300 riflemen had split from the main Matabele force, though they were indeed south of the river, undetected by Forbes)"", ' Visibility was poor by now, and rain periodically fell', "" The laager received no word from Wilson until about 21:00, when Sergeant-Major Judge and Corporal Ebbage arrived from across the river to tell Forbes that Wilson had found Lobengula's tracks, and followed him for "", ' Wilson regarded the chances of taking the king alive as so good that he was going to remain north of the river overnight', ' He asked Forbes to send more men and a Maxim gun in the morning, but did not explain what he planned to do with them', '  The Shangani Patrol continued its approach during the late evening, and scouted close to the bush enclosure housing Lobengula', ' Captain William Napier repeatedly called to the king in the Matabele language, Sindebele, but received no reply from the Matabele leaders, who remained silent and hid themselves', "" The patrol's actions confused the Matabele, who could not understand why there appeared to be so few Company soldiers, nor why they would reveal their position like this"", "" They concluded that it must be a trap, and were only satisfied that it was not when Wilson's men had stopped during their approach to call to Lobengula five times"", ' Following the fifth call from Napier, Mjaan ordered his riflemen to gather around the patrol, intending to pocket it', ' Noticing this, Wilson ordered a retreat, and took up a well-covered position in the bush where he could hide until daybreak', ' When Lieutenant Hofmeyer and Troopers Bradburn and Colquhoun were lost amid the increasingly stormy night, Wilson briefly backtracked to recover them', '  On returning to his bush camp, Wilson sent a further message to the laager, which reached its destination at around 23:00: Napier, Scout Bain and Trooper Robertson were the men acting as runners', ' Wilson repeated that he was going to stay north of the river overnight, close to the king, and asked Forbes to bring the whole column across by 04:00 in the morning', ' Forbes thought it unwise to attempt a full river crossing at night, which he reasoned might lead to his force being surrounded in the darkness and massacred, but also felt he could not recall Wilson, as to do so would be to lose Lobengula for sure', '  As a compromise, Forbes sent Captain Henry Borrow across with 21 men at 01:00 on 4 December, and told Borrow to relay to Wilson that the laager was surrounded, and ""expected to be attacked any moment""', "" Forbes apparently intended for Borrow's reinforcements to secure Wilson's position, but historian W\xa0D Gale writes that this was a serious tactical error on Forbes's part: the addition of Borrow's men made Wilson's patrol too large to be a mere reconnoitring force, but still too small to overpower the Matabele and capture the king"", "" Indeed, Wilson and his officers looked on gloomily when Borrow's men arrived soon after dawn, fewer in number than expected and without the requested Maxim gun"", ' Only 20 of the reinforcements (including Borrow himself) reached Wilson—Troopers Landsberg and Nesbitt became separated from the main group along the way, and eventually rejoined Forbes during the morning', '

doomed resignation about them"", and suggests that the major believed no other path was open, and was therefore going for broke', ' The Matabele hovered around the vicinity, waiting to see what Wilson would do next', "" On the southern side of the river, the 300 Matabele riflemen took up a well-covered position near the riverbank, about  to the left of Forbes's position"", ' Hidden by a patch of scrub, they remained undetected by the Company troops', ""  Wilson, Borrow and the 35 others made for Lobengula's enclosure"", "" The king's wagon was still there, but when Wilson called to him, there was no answer"", ' The king had moved on during the night', ' At that moment, the troopers heard the sound of rifles being cocked in the wood surrounding them', ' A Matabele inDuna stepped out from behind a tree and announced that the enclosure was surrounded by thousands of Matabele who wanted to ""see if the white men were afraid to die', '"" He then fired his rifle to signal the start of the attack to his men', ' A volley from the Matabele riflemen followed, but most of the shots went too high; no Company trooper was hit', "" The only casualties of this opening volley were two of the patrol's horses"", ' Wilson immediately ordered his men to fall back, first to an antheap, then to a thick wood', ' Three of them were wounded during this retreat, but none fatally', '  Hearing the shots from the northern side of the river, Forbes uneasily moved towards the southern bank, intending to cross and help Wilson', "" However, Forbes's fears of an ambush proved to be well-founded; at an opportune moment, the Matabele in the scrub opened fire, catching the column in the open"", "";  The ambushers' shots were initially wild and inaccurate, but they soon began to focus their fire on the exposed Maxim guns and horses, forcing the troopers to retreat to cover"", ' Five Company soldiers were injured', ' The resulting skirmish lasted about an hour, by which time the Shangani had been severely swollen by heavy rains upstream, causing it to flood', '  Meanwhile, Wilson marched his officers and men back towards the river, hoping to reunite with Forbes', ' They moved on for about ,

began to fire on it from cover, killing several of its men', ' After a while, Mjaan ordered his men to charge forward and finish them off, but the Matabele soon fell back, having taken about 40 fatalities', '  Burnham, Ingram and Gooding reached the Shangani about 08:00, but quickly saw that the water had risen far too high for Forbes to provide any assistance', ' Realising the futility of turning back to Wilson without help, they decided to rejoin Forbes anyway, and to that end traversed the swollen river with considerable difficulty', ' They then rode to where the battle on the southern side was still going on', ' On reaching the main column shaken and out of breath, Burnham leapt from his horse and ran to Forbes: ""I think I may say that we are the sole survivors of that party,"" he quietly confided, before loading his rifle and joining the skirmish', ""; ;   Matabele victory north of the river; Wilson's last stand  What happened to the Shangani Patrol after this point is known only from Matabele sources"", "" According to these accounts, the warriors offered the remaining whites their lives if they surrendered, but Wilson's men refused to give up"", ' They used their dead horses for cover, and killed more than ten times their own number (about 500, Mjaan estimated), but were steadily whittled down as the overwhelming Matabele force closed in from all sides', ' The Company soldiers continued fighting even when grievously wounded, to the astonishment of the Matabele, who thought the whites must be bewitched: ""These are not men but magicians,"" said one Matabele inDuna', '  Late in the afternoon, after hours of fighting, Wilson\'s men ran out of ammunition, and reacted to this by rising to their feet, shaking each other\'s hands and singing a song, possibly ""God Save the Queen""', ' The Matabele downed their own rifles and ended the battle charging with assegai spears', ' Some of the whites allegedly used their last bullets to commit suicide', ' According to an eyewitness, ""the white inDuna"" (Wilson) was the last to die, standing motionless before the Matabele with blood streaming from wounds all over his body', ' After a few moments of hesitation, a young warrior ran forward and killed him with his assegai', ' The Matabele usually mutilated the bodies of their foes after a victory, but on this occasion they did not: ""The white men died so bravely we would not treat them as we do the cowardly Mashonas and others,"" an inDuna explained', "" At Mjaan's orders, the bodies of the patrol were left untouched, though the whites' clothes and two of their facial skins were collected the next morning to serve as proof to Lobengula of the battle's outcome"", ' ""I had two sons killed that day,"" Ingubo warrior

killed in action', ' Though the men of the patrol came from several parts of the British Empire as well as other countries, most were born in Britain itself: Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Marshall Hole writes that of these ""over a dozen were English Public School and University men""', ' Wilson himself was originally Scottish, while Borrow was born in Cornwall', ' Also represented in the patrol

southern side of the Shangani was over, Forbes and his column conducted a cursory search for survivors from Wilson's party, but, unable to cross the river, could see nothing to tell them what had happened"", ' Guessing (correctly) that all Company men beyond the river had been killed, they turned and trekked back to Bulawayo in miserable fashion, their supplies all but gone and the Matabele impeding their progress at every turn', '  Matabele raiding parties attacked the retreating column six times during its two-week journey back to Bulawayo', ' In pouring rain, the dishevelled men were soon mostly on foot, existing off horse meat and wearing makeshift shoes made from ammunition wallets', ' Forbes felt so humiliated by the events that he retreated from command in all but name, surrendering de facto control to Commandant Raaff', ' In leading the column back to Bulawayo, Raaff repeatedly drew on his experience from the Anglo-Zulu War to ensure the survival of the haggard men', ' He avoided several Matabele ambushes, and at one point set up a convincing decoy camp that the Matabele fired on for half a day, wasting much of their ammunition', ""  On the column's inglorious return to Bulawayo on 18 December 1893, Forbes was received in muted disgrace"", ' The officers and men stood on parade for Cecil Rhodes, and the Company chief passed the major without a word', "" Raaff, on the other hand, was publicly commended by Rhodes, and thanked for ensuring the column's safe return"", ""  Meanwhile, Lobengula moved to the north-east, now well out of the company's reach for the foreseeable future"", ' However, his sickness, which turned out to be smallpox, sharply intensified and eventually killed him on 22 or 23 January 1894', ' With the king dead, Mjaan, the most senior of the izinDuna, took command of the Matabele', ' Mjaan was an old man, and his only son had been killed in the war', ' He wished to make peace', ' In late February 1894, he convened an indaba at which he and his contemporaries met with James Dawson, a trader known to them for many years, who offered the olive branch on behalf of the company', ' The izinDuna unanimously accepted', ' They also told the trader what had happened to the Shangani Patrol, and led him to the battle site to survey it, as well as to examine and identify the largely skeletonised bodies of the soldiers, which still lay where they had fallen', ' Dawson was the first non-Matabele to learn of the last stand', '  Cultural impact, burial and memorial [[File:Zimbabwe Shangani Memorial',

by the incident, Cheer, Boys, Cheer!, was written by Augustus Harris, Cecil Raleigh and Henry Hamilton, and staged at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, starting in September 1895', ' The show tells the story of a young colonial army officer in South Africa and Rhodesia, culminating in the third act with a fictionalised account of the First Matabele War', "" This itself climaxes with a scene strongly reminiscent of Wilson's last stand"", ' The production ran for nearly six months in London, and then toured the British provinces for more than two years,; ;  reportedly drawing large crowds', ' According to historian Neil Parsons, it contributed to the patrol ""fast gain[ing] mythological status""', '  In historical terms, the Shangani Patrol subsequently became an integral part of Rhodesian identity, with Wilson and Borrow in particular woven into the national tapestry as heroic figures symbolising duty in the face of insuperable odds', ';  Their last stand together became a kind of national myth, as Lewis Gann writes, ""a glorious memory, [Rhodesia\'s] own equivalent of the bloody Alamo massacre and Custer\'s Last Stand in the American West""', ' In 1895, 4 December was declared ""Shangani Day"", an annual Rhodesian public holiday which endured until 1920, when it was folded into Occupation Day, a national non-work day which commemorated several early colonial events together', ' Shangani Day remained part of the national calendar, however, and was still marked each year', ""  The remains of the patrol's members were buried on 14 August 1894, in the ruined city of Great Zimbabwe"", "" Rhodes later wrote into his will that he wished to have the patrol re-interred alongside him at World's View, in the Matopos Hills, when he died; this was done in 1904, two years after Rhodes's death"", "" Also according to Rhodes's wishes, a memorial to the Shangani Patrol was erected at World's View in July 1904, and dedicated by Bishop William Gaul of Mashonaland"", ' The monument, called the Shangani Memorial, is an oblong, flat-topped structure, about  tall and made from granite from a nearby kopje', ' It was designed by Herbert Baker, and based on the Pedestal of

Matabele messengers, Petchan and Sehuloholu, had been given a box of gold sovereigns by Lobengula, and instructed to intercept the column before it reached the river"", ' They were to tell the whites that the king admitted defeat and offered this tribute, totalling about £1,000, on the condition that the column immediately turn back and cease harassing him', ' ""Gold is the only thing that will stop the white men,"" Lobengula reportedly concluded', ' According to the inDuna, Petchan and Sehuloholu reached the column on 2 December 1893, the day before it reached the Shangani, and hid in the bush as it went by', ' They then caught up with it and gave the money and the message to two men in the rear guard', '  [[File:Sovereign Victoria 1842 662015', 'jpg|thumb|left|Gold sovereigns bearing

Company authorities made enquiries', ' No man who had been attached to the column corroborated the account', ' The Company thought it unlikely that a Matabele inDuna would simply invent a story such as this, however, and angrily speculated that if it were true, then negotiations with Lobengula might have been opened and the war ended before Wilson crossed the river, and the entire episode of the Shangani Patrol avoided (though, as historian Robert Cary writes, this surmision ignores the fact that Forbes had been ordered to capture Lobengula, not end the war)', ' Lawyers appointed by the company launched a formal investigation early in 1894', ""  Two officers' batmen, William Charles Daniel and James Wilson (no relation to Allan Wilson), soon became prime suspects, with Daniel arraigned as the senior instigator"", ' They were accused of accepting the gold from Petchan and Sehuloholu, then keeping it for themselves and not passing on the message', ' Both men denied all charges', ' Neither Daniel nor Wilson had been members of the rear guard on 2 December, though either or both could have been there at some point during the day', ' No Matabele witness recognised either of them at the court in Bulawayo, where the case was heard by the Resident Magistrate and four assessors', ""  The evidence against the batmen was largely circumstantial: both had been seen to possess unusually large amounts of gold soon after the column's return, and both had since bought farming rights, paying cash"", ' Daniel said he had won the money in his possession playing cards, while Wilson claimed to have brought his with him when he came to Rhodesia', ' Witnesses confirmed that there had been heavy gambling at Inyati camp, in which Daniel and Wilson had actively taken part, both possessing noticeable reserves in gold sovereigns', ' Sehuloholu claimed in his statement that both of the men he had met in the rear guard had fluently and perfectly spoken to him in Sindebele, but neither of the accused men knew the language, and the only member of the column who did at a fluent level was a medical orderly who had never been near the rear guard', ' The prosecutor proposed that Sehuloholu could be exaggerating the standard of Sindebele spoken by the men he had met, pointing out that most of the phrases quoted were actually relatively basic, and did not imply a profound understanding of the language', ""  Unable to definitely prove to the court where their money had come from, Daniel and Wilson were eventually found guilty, and sentenced to 14 years' hard labour"", ' However, the maximum term the Magistrate could legally impose was three months, and in 1896 they were released at the order of the High Commissioner for Southern Africa, Sir Henry Brougham Loch', "" The High Commissioner's legal team subsequently quashed the convictions altogether, saying that the evidence against Daniel and Wilson was not sufficiently conclusive"", "" The existence of Lobengula's box of sovereigns was never proven either way, and the incident never explained beyond doubt"", ""  Burnham, Ingram and Gooding  The version of events recorded by history is based on the accounts of Burnham, Ingram and Gooding, the Matabele present at the battle (particularly inDuna Mjaan), and the men of Forbes's column"", ""; ; ; ; ;  Burnham, Ingram and Gooding's stories closely corroborate each other; their version of events was accepted as true by the Court of Inquiry at Bulawayo in December 1893"", "" First-hand Matabele accounts such as Mjaan's, which were first recorded during 1894, appear to confirm the character of the break-out, saying that three of the white men they were fighting—including Burnham, whom several of them recognised—left during a lull in the battle, just after Wilson withdrew to his final position"", 'Letter dated February 1894 detailing Matabele accounts, quoted in   While all of the direct evidence given by eyewitnesses supports the findings of the Court of Inquiry, some historians and writers debate whether or not Burnham, Ingram and Gooding really were sent back by Wilson to fetch help, and suggest that they might have simply deserted when the battle got rough', ' Proponents of this desertion theory frequently portray Burnham as a man who embellished facts and coerced eyewitnesses into falsifying statements', "" The earliest recording of this claim of desertion is in a letter written in 1935 by John Coghlan, a cousin of Southern Rhodesia's first Prime Minister, Charles Coghlan"", ' John Coghlan wrote to a friend, John Carruthers, on 14 December that year that ""a very reliable man informed me that Wools-Sampson told him"" that Gooding had confessed on his deathbed (in 1899) that he and the two Americans had not actually been despatched by Wilson, and had simply left on their own accord', "" This double hearsay confession, coming from an anonymous source, is not mentioned in Gooding's 1899 obituary, which instead recounts the events as generally recorded"", '  Peter Emmerson, a historian and supporter of the desertion theory, asks why Wilson would have sent three of his men away at such a precarious moment', ' J\xa0P Lott, another historian, comments that Wilson had sent runners to Forbes twice the previous night, when he was already at very close quarters with the Matabele and with far fewer men; he surmises that it would not be out of the ordinary for the major to do so again', "" In his evaluation John O'Reilly asks why Wilson sent Gooding back with the two Americans; surely Burnham and Ingram, both seasoned scouts, were enough? Gooding writes in his account that Wilson originally only asked Burnham to ride to Forbes, and that Captain Judd suggested to Wilson that Burnham should take two men with him"", ' The Chief of Scouts requested Ingram, and Borrow asked Gooding to go too', ' Burnham also says that Borrow sent Gooding', '  Burnham, Ingram and Gooding each received the British South Africa Company Medal for their service in the First Matabele War, and all three subsequently served in the Second Matabele War of 1896–97', "" All of the officers and troopers of Forbes' column reported high praise for Burnham's actions and none reported any doubts about his conduct even decades later"", ' One member of the column, Trooper M\xa0E Weale, told the Rhodesia Herald on 22 December 1944 that once Commandant Raaff took over command it was greatly due to Burnham\'s good scouting that the column managed to get away: ""I have always felt that the honours were equally divided between these two men, to whom we owed our lives on that occasion', '"" Burnham proceeded to become a key figure for a number of commanding officers, including Frederick Carrington, Robert Baden-Powell, and Frederick Roberts', ' Carrington called him ""the finest scout who ever scouted in Africa', ' He was my Chief of Scouts in \'96 in Matabeleland and he was the eyes and ears of my force""', ' The US President Theodore Roosevelt described him in 1901 as ""a scout and a hunter of courage and ability, a man totally without fear, a sure shot, and a fighter\xa0', '', '', ' the ideal scout', '"" While fighting with the British Army in the Second Boer War, Burnham was adjudged to have shown exceptional heroism and was decorated with the Distinguished Service Order, then Britain\'s second highest military honour', '  Legacy  The last stand of the patrol was re-enacted once more at the 1899 Greater Britain Exhibition in London, during which scenes from the Matabele wars were re-created as part of a play called Savage South Africa: A Vivid, Realistic and Picturesque Representation of Life in the Wilds of Africa, culminating in ""Major Wilson\'s Last Stand""', ' The show featured Lobengula\'s son, Peter Lobengula—described as ""Prince Lobengula, the redoubtable warrior chieftain""', "" A short war film based the show's version of the final engagement, Major Wilson's Last Stand, was released by Levi, Jones & Company studios in 1899"", ' A song about the events, ""Shangani Patrol"", was written by the Rhodesian singer-songwriter John Edmond, and first recorded by the South African singer Nick Taylor in 1966 as the B-side for another Edmond composition, ""The U', 'D', 'I', ' Song"", about Rhodesia\'s Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965', ' The patriotic record topped the Rhodesian hit parade for four weeks', ' A historical war film, also called Shangani Patrol, was filmed on location and released in 1970', "" The author Alexander Fullerton wrote a novel about the patrol's last stand, entitled The White Men Sang (1958)"", ' Wilbur Smith fictionalised the Shangani patrol in his 1981 novel Men of Men', ""  Though much of the mythology surrounding the patrol and the site has dissipated in the national consciousness since the country's reconstitution as Zimbabwe in 1980, World's View endures as a tourist attraction to this day"", ' A campaign in the 1990s to dismantle the monument and remove the graves met with strong opposition from both local residents and the Department of National Museums and Monuments, partly because of the income it brings from visitors, and partly out of respect for the site and the history surrounding it', ""  Notes and referencesFootnotesSource notesOnline sources Newspaper and journal articles                                 Other sources Bibliography'                                                                             Further reading     Category:1893 in Matabeleland Category:19th century in Africa Category:Battles involving the British South Africa Company Category:Conflicts in 1893 Category:Last stands""]","They then caught up with it and gave the money and the message to two men in the rear guard.Daniel said he had won the money in his possession playing cards, while Wilson claimed to have brought his with him when he came to Rhodesia.Unable to definitely prove to the court where their money had come from, Daniel and Wilson were eventually found guilty, and sentenced to 14 years' hard labour.A campaign in the 1990s to dismantle the monument and remove the graves met with strong opposition from both local residents and the Department of National Museums and Monuments, partly because of the income it brings from visitors, and partly out of respect for the site and the history surrounding it"

survivors on the ground"", ' The majority of Rhodesians, both black and white, saw the attack as an act of terrorism', ' A fierce Rhodesian backlash followed against enemy strongholds and increased racial tension even though few black Rhodesians supported attacks of this kind', "" Reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as Time magazine, but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments, much to the Rhodesian government's indignation"", '  Talks between Nkomo and Prime Minister Ian Smith, which had been progressing promisingly, were immediately suspended by the Rhodesians, with Smith calling Nkomo a ""monster""', ' On 10 September, Smith announced the extension of martial law over selected areas', ' The Rhodesian Security Forces launched several retaliatory strikes into Zambia and Mozambique over the following months, attacking both ZIPRA and its rival, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA)', ' The attack on

independence before majority rule"" had recently gained ground in Britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation, and Rhodesia\'s government was dominated by the country\'s white minority, so the unilateral declaration went unrecognised internationally', ' Britain and the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia', ""  Two rival communist-backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule: the Chinese-aligned Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), mostly comprising Shonas, created the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and adopted aspects of Maoist doctrine, while the Ndebele-dominated Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), aligned with Soviet-style Marxism–Leninism and the Warsaw Pact, mobilised the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA)"", ';   These guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the ""Second Chimurenga"" against the Rhodesian government and security forces', ' The resulting conflict, the Rhodesian Bush War, began in earnest in December 1972, when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms in north-eastern Rhodesia', ""  After the security forces mounted a successful counter-insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974, developments overseas caused the conflict's momentum to shift in the insurgents' favour"", "" The leftist Carnation Revolution of April 1974 caused Portugal to withdraw its key economic support for Smith's administration, and led to Mozambique's independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with ZANU"", "" Around the same time, Rhodesia's other main backer, South Africa, adopted a détente initiative that forced a ceasefire, giving the guerrillas time to regroup"", ' Following the abortive Victoria Falls Conference of August 1975, Smith and the ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo held unsuccessful talks between December 1975 and March 1976', ' ZANU and ZAPU announced in October 1976, during the run-up to the unsuccessful Geneva Conference in December, that they would henceforth attend conferences as a joint ""Patriotic Front""', '  In March 1978, Smith and non-militant nationalist groups headed by Bishop Abel Muzorewa, the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole and Chief Jeremiah Chirau agreed what became the ""Internal Settlement""', ' This created a joint black–white transitional government, with the country due to be reconstituted as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, pursuant to multiracial elections', ' ZANU and ZAPU were invited to participate, but refused; Nkomo sardonically dubbed Smith\'s black colleagues ""the blacksmiths""', ' ZANU proclaimed 1978 to be ""The Year of the People"" as the war continued', "" Officials from Muzorewa's United African National Council, sent to the provinces to explain the Internal Settlement to rural blacks, were killed by Marxist–Leninist guerrillas"", ' Insurgents also began to target Christian missionaries, climaxing in the killing of nine British missionaries and four children at Elim Mission near the Mozambican border in the Vumba massacre on 23 June', '  The transitional government was badly received abroad, partly because the Internal Settlement kept control of law enforcement, the military, the judiciary and the civil service under white control', "" No country recognised Rhodesia's interim administration"", ' Smith again worked to bring Nkomo into the government, hoping this would lend it some credence domestically, prompt diplomatic recognition overseas, and help the security forces defeat ZANLA', ' Starting on 14

shifting public opinion', ' Sibanda asserts that the massacre ""cannot be put beyond"" the Scouts, and also supports Nkomo\'s claim that the Hunyani had been used militarily, suggesting that ZIPRA
