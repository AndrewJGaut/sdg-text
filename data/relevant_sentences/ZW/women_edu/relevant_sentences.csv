However, school fees are pegged differently for both groups, with the latter paying close to double of the former considering their parents contributed towards the construction of the school through deductions from salaries. On February 3, 2003, the school opened its doors to the first batch of students, with just under 100 students being enrolled and all being in Form 1. These students had six teachers (all who were civilians) with each taking two subjects each. Basic infrastructure had been set up and a lot of improvisation took place to make sure that the students were properly cared for and received the best education possible. Towards the end of that year, a batch for of students were chosen to be prefects who would later become school prefects for the next four years till they completed their O Level studies. The school registered a 98% pass rate, thus making it the best performing school in Harare, and one of the top in the country. Owing to inadequate equipment, the school had to improvise a lot, which saw the first batch of A Level students struggle, particularly in science. To date the school has been a force to reckon with in the debating spheres, and has further produced students who have managed to be part of the junior parliament of Zimbabwe.

In the meantime, although the devolution policy inaugurated an irrevocable process of bringing university education to the Midlands, there was a strong feeling, especially in the Province, that what was being done did not quite amount to the President's promise of a fully fledged state university in the province. The academic authority of the university is vested in the Senate, comprising the university's chief officers, the deans of faculties, all full professors, the chairmen of departments and staff and student representatives.

However, school fees are pegged differently for both groups, with the latter paying close to double of the former considering their parents contributed towards the construction of the school through deductions from salaries. On February 3, 2003, the school opened its doors to the first batch of students, with just under 100 students being enrolled and all being in Form 1. These students had six teachers (all who were civilians) with each taking two subjects each. Basic infrastructure had been set up and a lot of improvisation took place to make sure that the students were properly cared for and received the best education possible. Towards the end of that year, a batch for of students were chosen to be prefects who would later become school prefects for the next four years till they completed their O Level studies. The school registered a 98% pass rate, thus making it the best performing school in Harare, and one of the top in the country. Owing to inadequate equipment, the school had to improvise a lot, which saw the first batch of A Level students struggle, particularly in science. To date the school has been a force to reckon with in the debating spheres, and has further produced students who have managed to be part of the junior parliament of Zimbabwe.

Towards the end of that year, a batch for of students were chosen to be prefects who would later become school prefects for the next four years till they completed their O Level studies. The school registered a 98% pass rate, thus making it the best performing school in Harare, and one of the top in the country. Owing to inadequate equipment, the school had to improvise a lot, which saw the first batch of A Level students struggle, particularly in science.

In the meantime, although the devolution policy inaugurated an irrevocable process of bringing university education to the Midlands, there was a strong feeling, especially in the Province, that what was being done did not quite amount to the President's promise of a fully fledged state university in the province. The academic authority of the university is vested in the Senate, comprising the university's chief officers, the deans of faculties, all full professors, the chairmen of departments and staff and student representatives.

In the meantime, although the devolution policy inaugurated an irrevocable process of bringing university education to the Midlands, there was a strong feeling, especially in the Province, that what was being done did not quite amount to the President's promise of a fully fledged state university in the province. The academic authority of the university is vested in the Senate, comprising the university's chief officers, the deans of faculties, all full professors, the chairmen of departments and staff and student representatives.

However, school fees are pegged differently for both groups, with the latter paying close to double of the former considering their parents contributed towards the construction of the school through deductions from salaries. On February 3, 2003, the school opened its doors to the first batch of students, with just under 100 students being enrolled and all being in Form 1. These students had six teachers (all who were civilians) with each taking two subjects each. Basic infrastructure had been set up and a lot of improvisation took place to make sure that the students were properly cared for and received the best education possible. Towards the end of that year, a batch for of students were chosen to be prefects who would later become school prefects for the next four years till they completed their O Level studies. The school registered a 98% pass rate, thus making it the best performing school in Harare, and one of the top in the country. Owing to inadequate equipment, the school had to improvise a lot, which saw the first batch of A Level students struggle, particularly in science. To date the school has been a force to reckon with in the debating spheres, and has further produced students who have managed to be part of the junior parliament of Zimbabwe.
