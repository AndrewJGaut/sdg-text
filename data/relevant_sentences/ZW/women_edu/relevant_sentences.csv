alternative name for the country, proposing names such as ""Matshobana"" and ""Monomotapa"" before his suggestion, ""Zimbabwe"", prevailed', ' A further alternative, put forward by nationalists in Matabeleland, had been ""Matopos"", referring to the Matopos Hills to the south of Bulawayo', '  It was initially unclear how the chosen term was to be used—a letter written by Mawema in 1961 refers

(BSAC), would administer the territory stretching from the Limpopo to Lake Tanganyika under charter as a protectorate"", ' Queen Victoria signed the charter in 1889', ' Rhodes used this document in 1890 to justify sending the Pioneer Column, a group of white settlers protected by well-armed British South Africa Police (BSAP) and guided by the big game hunter Frederick Selous, through Matabeleland and into Shona territory to establish Fort Salisbury (now Harare)', ' In 1893–1894, with the help of their new Maxim guns, the BSAP defeated the Ndebele in the First Matabele War, a war which also resulted in the death of King Lobengula and the death of most of the members of the Shangani Patrol', ' Shortly after the disastrous BSAP Jameson Raid into the Transvaal Republic, the Ndebele were led by their spiritual leader Mlimo against the white colonials and thus began the Second Matabele War (1896–97) which resulted in the extermination of nearly half the British settlers', ' After months of bloodshed, Mlimo was found and shot by the American scout Frederick Russell Burnham and soon thereafter Rhodes walked unarmed into the Ndebele stronghold in Matobo Hills and persuaded the impi to lay down their arms, effectively ending the revolt', ""  A legislative council was created in 1899 to manage the company's civil affairs, with a minority of elected seats, through which the BSAC had to pass government measures"", ' As the company was a British institution in which settlers and capitalists owned most shares, and local black African tribal chiefs the remainder, and the electorate to this council was limited to those shareholders, the electorate was almost exclusively white settlers', ' Over time as more settlers arrived and a growing number had less than the amount of land required to own a share in the company or where in trades supporting the company as workers, successive activism resulted in first increasing the proportion of elected seats, and eventually allowing non-share holders the right to vote in the election', ' Prior to about 1918, the opinion among the electorate supported continued BSAC rule but opinion changed because of the development of the country and increased settlement', ' In addition, a decision in the British courts that land not in private ownership belonged to the British Crown rather than the BSAC gave great impetus to the campaign for self-government', ' In the resulting treaty government self-government, Crown lands which were sold to settlers allowed those settlers the right to vote in the

for expanding the self-government of the Rhodesian people which saw BSAC rule as an impediment to further expansion', '  The Southern Rhodesian Legislative Council election of 1920 returned a large majority of candidates of the Responsible Government Association and it became clear that BSAC rule was no longer practical', ' Opinion in the United Kingdom and South Africa favoured incorporation of Southern Rhodesia in the Union of South Africa, but, by forcing the pace of negotiation, the Southern Rhodesians obtained unfavourable terms and the electorate backed Responsible Government in a 1922

therefore vulnerable to the economic cycle', ' The deep recession of the 1930s gave way to a post-war boom', ' This boom prompted the immigration of about 200,000 white settlers between 1945 and 1970, taking the white population up to 307,000', ' A large number of these immigrants were of British working-class origin', ' More settlers from the Belgian Congo, Kenya, Tanzania, and later Angola and Mozambique as well as increased birth rate, raised the Rhodesian white population to 600,000 by 1976', '  The black population was about 6\xa0million', '  In the 1940s, the founding of a university to

possessions, the United Kingdom created the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (or the Central African Federation, CAF), which consisted of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland (now Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi, respectively)', ' The idea was to try to steer a middle road between the differing aspirations of the black nationalists, the colonial administration and the white settler population', ' The CAF sought to emulate the experience of Australia, Canada and South Africa – wherein groups of colonies had been federated together to form viable independent nations', ' Originally designed to be ""an indissoluble federation"", the CAF quickly started to unravel due to the low proportion of British and other white citizens in relation to the larger black populations', ' Additionally, by incorporating the tribes within the Federation as potential citizens, the Federation created the paradoxical situation of having a white elite owning most of the land and capital, whilst using cheap black labour', '  The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was dissolved on 1 January 1964', ' However, it was expected that only Nyasaland would be let go, whilst the remainder of Rhodesia both north and south would be united', ' Although Northern Rhodesia had a white population of over 100,000, as well as additional British military and civil units and their dependents, most of these were relatively new to the region, were primarily in the extraction business, had little landed interests, and were more amenable to allowing black nationalism than the Southern Rhodesians', ' Accordingly, Britain granted independence to Northern Rhodesia on 24 October 1964', ' However, when the new nationalists changed its name to Zambia and began tentatively at first and later in rapid march an Africanisation campaign, Southern Rhodesia remained a British colony, resisting attempts to bring in majority rule', ' The colony attempted to change its name to Rhodesia although this was not recognised by the United Kingdom', "" The majority of the Federation's military and financial assets went to Southern Rhodesia, since the British Government did not wish to see them fall into the hands of the nationalist leaders, and since Southern Rhodesia had borne the major expenses of running the Federation"", ' With regard to the latter, however, Northern Rhodesia was the wealthiest of the three member states (due to its vast copper mines) and had contributed more to the overall building of infrastructure than the other two members did', ' Southern Rhodesia, recognising an inevitable dissolution of the Federation, was quick to use federal funds in building its infrastructure ahead of the others', ' A key component of this was the building of the Kariba Dam and its

norms such as child marriage', ' Young girls often run away with older men when their educational opportunities are limited or to escape a violent household', ' These incidents of domestic violence or young girls running away with older men are usually not investigated by police as men are viewed as superior to women in Zimbabwean culture and their role as the dominant person in the relationship is

heavily scrutinised', ' Women seeking to participate in the political landscape as candidates or voters cite violence as one of the main reasons they are dissuaded from participating', ' Lack of financial resources and confidence in their abilities stops many young women from attempting to run as well as preconceived notions about women in politics creates an environment that limits their involvement and desire to be involved in politics', ' Women also make up a disproportionate amount of the rural poor in Zimbabwe and make up 70% of the agricultural work force', ' The rural poor find it difficult to access information and materials in relation to politics as well as travel to polling stations and become registered to vote', ' Collectively, women control 35% of parliamentary seats

thousand years ago', ' They produced rock paintings at Lapalala within the Waterberg, including depictions of rhinoceros and antelope', ' Early Iron Age settlers in Waterberg were Bantu, who had brought cattle to the region', ' The Bantu created a problem in Waterberg, since cattle reduced grassland caused invasion of brush species leading to an outbreak of the tse-tse fly', ' The ensuing

Taylor, Gerald Hinde and David Holt-Biddle, The Waterberg, Struik Publishers, Cape Ttown, South Africa (2003)  These extruded rocks, containing minerals such as vanadium and platinum, are called the Bushveld Igneous Complex', ' The original extent of this rock upthrust involved about 250,000 square kilometers, and is sometimes called the Waterberg Supergroup', '  Sedimentary deposition from rivers cutting through Waterberg endured until roughly 1', '5 billion years ago', ' In more recent time (around 250 million years ago) the Kaapvaal craton collided with the supercontinent Gondwana,

retain groundwater sufficient to make a suitable environment for primitive man', ' The cliff overhangs offered natural shelters for these early humans', ' The first human ancestors may have been at Waterberg as early as three million years ago, since Makapansgat, 40 kilometers distant, has yielded skeletons of Australopithecus africanus', ' Hogan suggests that Homo erectus, whose evidence remains were also discovered in Makapansgat, ""may have purposefully moved into the higher areas of the Waterberg for summer (December to March) game""', '  Bushmen entered Waterberg around two thousand years ago', ' They produced rock paintings at Lapalala within the Waterberg, including depictions of rhinoceros and antelope', ' Early Iron Age settlers in Waterberg were Bantu, who had brought cattle to the region', ' The Bantu created a problem in Waterberg, since cattle reduced grassland caused invasion of brush species leading to an outbreak of the tse-tse fly', ' The ensuing epidemic of sleeping sickness depopulated the plains, but at higher elevations man survived, because the fly cannot survive above 600 meters', '  Later people left the first Stone Age artifacts recovered in northern South Africa', ' Starting about the year 1300 AD, Nguni settlers arrived with new technologies, including the ability to build dry-stone walls, which techniques were then used to add defensive works to their Iron Age forts, some of which walls survive to today', '  Archaeologists continue to excavate Waterberg to shed light on the Nguni culture and the associated dry-stone architecture', '  The first white settlers arrived in Waterberg in 1808 and the first naturalist a Swede appeared just before mid 19th century', ' Around the mid 19th century, a group of Dutch travelers set out from Cape Town in search of Jerusalem', ' Arriving in Waterberg, they mis-estimated their distance and thought they had reached Egypt', '  After battles between Dutch settlers and tribesmen, the races co-existed until around 1900', ' The Dutch brought further cattle grazing, multiplying the impacts of indigenous tribes', ' By the beginning of the 20th century there were an

forest, with trees such as mountain syringa, silver cluster-leaf and lavender tree', ' The canopy is mostly leafless during the dry winter', ' Native grasses include signal grass, goose grass and heather-topped grass', ' Indigenous grasses provide graze to support native species including impala, kudu, klipspringer and blue wildebeest', ' Some Pachypodium habitats are found especially in

surface waters all drain to the Limpopo River which flows easterly to discharge into the Indian Ocean', ' The river bushwillow is a riparian tree in this habitat', ' These riparian zones offer habitat for birds, reptiles and mammals that require more water than plateau species', ' The riverine areas are inhabited by the apex predator Nile crocodile and the hippopotamus', ' These wet habitats have reduced numbers of water-living insects, and the Waterberg is thus considered an almost malaria-free region', '  Land management As of 2006 about 80,000 people lived on the Waterberg plateau, which is part of the Bushveld district of Limpopo Province of South Africa', ' After cattle grazing wrought ecological havoc in the mid 1900s, the land owners of the region became aware of the benefits of restoring habitat to attract and protect the original species of antelope, white rhino, giraffe, hippopotami, and other species whose numbers dropped in the era of intense cattle grazing', '  The rise in eco-tourism has stimulated interest in soil conservation practices to restore original grass species to the Waterberg', ' The land management practises required are expensive, but repay the

were girls who attended the college', '  Foundation The school was founded by a group of prominent individuals of both European and African races and both sexes to be a leading high school for African boys though it had been set up with the view of it becoming a multiracial international school', ',  The founders had seen the winds of change sweeping across Africa and felt they had to provide high quality education, equivalent to what Europeans were receiving, for the future leaders of an independent Rhodesia', ' The whole idea behind the school was to bring up well-rounded African leaders in areas of finance, industry, business, education, medicine, law, military and politics', ' Rt', ' Reverend Cecil Alderson, like his predecessor Bishop Edward Paget,  realised the need for a senior college for Africans had become increasingly urgent, and within a few weeks of his translation from the Bloemfontein Diocese, Bishop Alderson began to investigate ways of meeting it', ' At the same

responsibility for shooting down the Hunyani in an interview with the BBC's Today programme the next day, saying the aircraft had been used for military purposes, but denied that his men had killed survivors on the ground"", ' The majority of Rhodesians, both black and white, saw the attack as an act of terrorism', ' A fierce Rhodesian backlash followed against enemy strongholds and increased racial tension even though few black Rhodesians supported attacks of this kind', "" Reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as Time magazine, but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments, much to the Rhodesian government's indignation"", '  Talks between Nkomo and Prime Minister Ian Smith, which had been progressing promisingly, were immediately suspended by the Rhodesians, with Smith calling Nkomo a ""monster""', ' On 10 September, Smith announced the extension of martial law over selected areas', ' The Rhodesian Security Forces launched several retaliatory strikes into Zambia and Mozambique over the following months, attacking both ZIPRA and its rival, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA)', ' The attack on ZIPRA in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were refugees camping in and around guerrilla positions', ' In February 1979, ZIPRA shot down Air Rhodesia Flight 827, another civilian flight, in an almost identical incident', '  Background [[File:Zimbabwe in Africa', 'svg|thumb|upright|Rhodesia]] A dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty to the

independence before majority rule"" had recently gained ground in Britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation, and Rhodesia\'s government was dominated by the country\'s white minority, so the unilateral declaration went unrecognised internationally', ' Britain and the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia', ""  Two rival communist-backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule: the Chinese-aligned Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), mostly comprising Shonas, created the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and adopted aspects of Maoist doctrine, while the Ndebele-dominated Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), aligned with Soviet-style Marxism–Leninism and the Warsaw Pact, mobilised the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA)"", ';   These guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the ""Second Chimurenga"" against the Rhodesian government and security forces', ' The resulting conflict, the Rhodesian Bush War, began in earnest in December 1972, when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms in north-eastern Rhodesia', ""  After the security forces mounted a successful counter-insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974, developments overseas caused the conflict's momentum to shift in the insurgents' favour"", "" The leftist Carnation Revolution of April 1974 caused Portugal to withdraw its key economic support for Smith's administration, and led to Mozambique's independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with ZANU"", "" Around the same time, Rhodesia's other main backer, South Africa, adopted a détente initiative that forced a ceasefire, giving the guerrillas time to regroup"", ' Following the abortive Victoria Falls Conference of August 1975, Smith and the ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo held unsuccessful talks between December 1975 and March 1976', ' ZANU and ZAPU announced in October 1976, during the run-up to the unsuccessful Geneva Conference in December, that they would henceforth attend conferences as a joint ""Patriotic Front""', '  In March 1978, Smith and non-militant nationalist groups headed by Bishop Abel Muzorewa, the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole and Chief Jeremiah Chirau agreed what became the ""Internal Settlement""', ' This created a joint black–white transitional government, with the country due to be reconstituted as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, pursuant to multiracial elections', ' ZANU and ZAPU were invited to participate, but refused; Nkomo sardonically dubbed Smith\'s black colleagues ""the blacksmiths""', ' ZANU proclaimed 1978 to be ""The Year of the People"" as the war continued', "" Officials from Muzorewa's United African National Council, sent to the provinces to explain the Internal Settlement to rural blacks, were killed by Marxist–Leninist guerrillas"", ' Insurgents also began to target Christian missionaries, climaxing in the killing of nine British missionaries and four children at Elim Mission near the Mozambican border in the Vumba massacre on 23 June', '  The transitional government was badly received abroad, partly because the Internal Settlement kept control of law enforcement, the military, the judiciary and the civil service under white control', "" No country recognised Rhodesia's interim administration"", ' Smith again worked to bring Nkomo into the government, hoping this would lend it some credence domestically, prompt diplomatic recognition overseas, and help the security forces defeat ZANLA', ' Starting on 14 August 1978, he attended secret meetings with Nkomo in Lusaka, Zambia (where ZAPU was based), doing so with the assistance of the mining corporation Lonrho', ' Attempts were made to also involve the ZANU leader Robert Mugabe, but Mugabe would have no part in the talks', ' According to the South African military historian Jakkie Cilliers, negotiations between Smith and Nkomo progressed well and

Salisbury, returning home after a weekend at the lake', ' The flight took off from Kariba Airport on schedule soon after 17:00 Central Africa Time', '  Flight 825 was piloted by 36-year-old Captain

plane's starboard wing and exploded, causing the inner engine to also explode"", ' A fuel tank and hydraulic lines ruptured, creating a fire that could not be put out', ' The second starboard engine failed almost immediately, leaving Hood with only his two port engines', ' Heaving wildly, the Hunyani began to descend rapidly', '  At 17:10 Captain Hood sent a distress call to air traffic control, informing them that he had lost the two starboard engines and was going to crash', ' ""We\'re going in,"" he radioed', ' Telling his passengers to brace for an emergency landing, he aimed for an open field of cotton in the Whamira Hills, in the bush to the west of Karoi, intending to belly land the craft', ' The landing was relatively stable until the Hunyani hit a ditch, cartwheeled and exploded', ' The remaining fuel tanks ruptured and caught fire, setting the wrecked cabin ablaze', '  Massacre on the ground Of the 56 people on board, 38, including Hood and Beaumont, died in the

and Shannon Hargreaves, Sharon Coles, and her four-year-old daughter Tracey—off in the direction of a nearby village in search of water', ' The other 13 remained close to the wreckage', ' Meanwhile, nine guerrillas made their way towards the crash site, and reached it at about 17:45', ' Three of the 13 survivors remaining at the crash site hid on seeing figures approaching: Rhodesian Army reservist Anthony Hill, 39, took cover in the surrounding bush, while businessman Hans Hansen and his wife Diana did the same', ' This left 10 passengers in full view near the wreckage, including four women and two girls (aged 11 and 4)', '  The guerrillas, who were armed with AK-47 rifles, presented themselves to the 10 passengers as friendly, saying they would summon help and bring water', ' They spoke in English, both to the survivors and among themselves', ' They told the passengers to congregate around a point a few metres from the wreckage; when the survivors said that some of them were too badly injured to walk, the insurgents told the able-bodied men to carry the others', ' The passengers were assembled into an area of about ', ' Standing roughly  away, the cadres now raised their weapons', ' ""You have taken our land,"" one of them said', ' ""Please don\'t shoot us!"" one of the passengers cried, just before they were killed by a sustained burst of automatic gunfire', '  Those that survived the initial bursts were bayoneted (including a mother and her 3-week-old baby)', '  Having collected water from the nearby village, MacLaren and his companions were almost back at the crash site when they heard the shots', ' Thinking it was personal ammunition in the luggage exploding in the heat, they continued on their way, and called out to the other passengers, who they thought

Matabeleland and into Shona territory to establish Fort Salisbury (now Harare)', ' In 1893–1894, with the help of their new Maxim guns, the BSAP defeated the Ndebele in the First Matabele War, a war

remainder, and the electorate to this council was limited to those shareholders, the electorate was almost exclusively white settlers', ' Over time as more settlers arrived and a growing number had less than the amount of land required to own a share in the company or where in trades supporting the company as workers, successive activism resulted in first increasing the proportion of elected seats, and eventually allowing non-share holders the right to vote in the election', ' Prior to about 1918, the opinion among the electorate supported continued BSAC rule but opinion changed because of the development of the country and increased settlement', ' In addition, a decision in the British courts that land not in private ownership belonged to the British Crown rather than the BSAC gave

for expanding the self-government of the Rhodesian people which saw BSAC rule as an impediment to further expansion', '  The Southern Rhodesian Legislative Council election of 1920 returned a large majority of candidates of the Responsible Government Association and it became clear that BSAC rule was no longer practical', ' Opinion in the United Kingdom and South Africa favoured incorporation of Southern Rhodesia in the Union of South Africa, but, by forcing the pace of negotiation, the Southern Rhodesians obtained unfavourable terms and the electorate backed Responsible Government in a 1922

possessions, the United Kingdom created the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (or the Central African Federation, CAF), which consisted of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland (now Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi, respectively)', ' The idea was to try to steer a middle road between the differing aspirations of the black nationalists, the colonial administration and the white settler population', ' The CAF sought to emulate the experience of Australia, Canada and South Africa – wherein groups of colonies had been federated together to form viable independent nations', ' Originally designed to be ""an indissoluble federation"", the CAF quickly started to unravel due to the low proportion of British and other white citizens in relation to the larger black populations', ' Additionally, by incorporating the tribes within the Federation as potential citizens, the Federation created the paradoxical situation of having a white elite owning most of the land and capital, whilst using cheap black labour', '  The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was dissolved on 1 January 1964', ' However, it was expected that only Nyasaland would be let go, whilst the remainder of Rhodesia both north and south would be united', ' Although Northern Rhodesia had a white population of over 100,000, as well as additional British military and civil units and their dependents, most of these were relatively new to the region, were primarily in the extraction business, had little landed interests, and were more amenable to allowing black nationalism than the Southern Rhodesians', ' Accordingly, Britain granted independence to Northern Rhodesia on 24 October 1964', ' However, when the new nationalists changed its name to Zambia and began tentatively at first and later in rapid march an Africanisation campaign, Southern Rhodesia remained a British colony, resisting attempts to bring in majority rule', ' The colony attempted to change its name to Rhodesia although this was not recognised by the United Kingdom', "" The majority of the Federation's military and financial assets went to Southern Rhodesia, since the British Government did not wish to see them fall into the hands of the nationalist leaders, and since Southern Rhodesia had borne the major expenses of running the Federation"", ' With regard to the latter, however, Northern Rhodesia was the wealthiest of the three member states (due to its vast copper mines) and had contributed more to the overall building of infrastructure than the other two members did', ' Southern Rhodesia, recognising an inevitable dissolution of the Federation, was quick to use federal funds in building its infrastructure ahead of the others', ' A key component of this was the building of the Kariba Dam and its hydroelectric facility (shafts, control centre, etc', '), which was situated on the Southern Rhodesian side of the Zambezi Gorge', ' This situation caused some embarrassment for the Zambian government later when it was a ""front line state"" in support of insurgents into Rhodesia in that its major source of electric power was controlled by the Rhodesian state', '  Return to ""Rhodesia""  With the protectorate of Northern Rhodesia no longer in existence, in 1964 Southern Rhodesia reverted to the name Rhodesia (see next section)', '  In 1965, Rhodesia unilaterally declared itself independent

acquired in America, and it was during this time with Burnham that perhaps the seeds were sown for the program and the code of honour eventually crystallised in Baden-Powell\'s 1899 ""Aids to Scouting for NCOs and Men"" and his later (1908) ""Scouting for Boys"", which was written after his experience of how useful and reliable the boys at Mafeking had been', ' Practiced by frontiersmen of the American Old West and Indigenous peoples of the Americas, woodcraft was generally unknown to the British', ' These skills eventually formed the basis of what is now called scoutcraft, the fundamentals of Scouting', ' Baden-Powell recognised that wars in Africa were changing markedly and the British Army needed to adapt; so during their joint scouting missions, Baden-Powell and Burnham discussed the

(BSAC), would administer the territory stretching from the Limpopo to Lake Tanganyika under charter as a protectorate"", ' Queen Victoria signed the charter in 1889', ' Rhodes used this document in 1890 to justify sending the Pioneer Column, a group of white settlers protected by well-armed British South Africa Police (BSAP) and guided by the big game hunter Frederick Selous, through Matabeleland and into Shona territory to establish Fort Salisbury (now Harare)', ' In 1893–1894, with the help of their new Maxim guns, the BSAP defeated the Ndebele in the First Matabele War, a war which also resulted in the death of King Lobengula and the death of most of the members of the Shangani Patrol', ' Shortly after the disastrous BSAP Jameson Raid into the Transvaal Republic, the Ndebele were led by their spiritual leader Mlimo against the white colonials and thus began the Second Matabele War (1896–97) which resulted in the extermination of nearly half the British settlers', ' After months of bloodshed, Mlimo was found and shot by the American scout Frederick Russell Burnham and soon thereafter Rhodes walked unarmed into the Ndebele stronghold in Matobo Hills and persuaded the impi to lay down their arms, effectively ending the revolt', ""  A legislative council was created in 1899 to manage the company's civil affairs, with a minority of elected seats, through which the BSAC had to pass government measures"", ' As the company was a British institution in which settlers and capitalists owned most shares, and local black African tribal chiefs the remainder, and the electorate to this council was limited to those shareholders, the electorate was almost exclusively white settlers', ' Over time as more settlers arrived and a growing number had less than the amount of land required to own a share in the company or where in trades supporting the company as workers, successive activism resulted in first increasing the proportion of elected seats, and eventually allowing non-share holders the right to vote in the election', ' Prior to about 1918, the opinion among the electorate supported continued BSAC rule but opinion changed because of the development of the country and increased settlement', ' In addition, a decision in the British courts that land not in private ownership belonged to the British Crown rather than the BSAC gave great impetus to the campaign for self-government', ' In the resulting treaty government self-government, Crown lands which were sold to settlers allowed those settlers the right to vote in the

""Rhodesia"" in a narrow sense to mean their part', ' The designation ""Southern Rhodesia"" was first used officially in 1898 in the Southern Rhodesia Order in Council of 20 October 1898, which

for expanding the self-government of the Rhodesian people which saw BSAC rule as an impediment to further expansion', '  The Southern Rhodesian Legislative Council election of 1920 returned a large majority of candidates of the Responsible Government Association and it became clear that BSAC rule was no longer practical', ' Opinion in the United Kingdom and South Africa favoured incorporation of Southern Rhodesia in the Union of South Africa, but, by forcing the pace of negotiation, the Southern Rhodesians obtained unfavourable terms and the electorate backed Responsible Government in a 1922

therefore vulnerable to the economic cycle', ' The deep recession of the 1930s gave way to a post-war boom', ' This boom prompted the immigration of about 200,000 white settlers between 1945 and 1970, taking the white population up to 307,000', ' A large number of these immigrants were of British working-class origin', ' More settlers from the Belgian Congo, Kenya, Tanzania, and later Angola and Mozambique as well as increased birth rate, raised the Rhodesian white population to 600,000 by 1976', '  The black population was about 6\xa0million', '  In the 1940s, the founding of a university to serve central African countries was proposed', ' Such a university was eventually established in Salisbury, with funding provided by the British and Southern Rhodesian governments and some private

possessions, the United Kingdom created the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (or the Central African Federation, CAF), which consisted of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland (now Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi, respectively)', ' The idea was to try to steer a middle road between the differing aspirations of the black nationalists, the colonial administration and the white settler population', ' The CAF sought to emulate the experience of Australia, Canada and South Africa – wherein groups of colonies had been federated together to form viable independent nations', ' Originally designed to be ""an indissoluble federation"", the CAF quickly started to unravel due to the low proportion of British and other white citizens in relation to the larger black populations', ' Additionally, by incorporating the tribes within the Federation as potential citizens, the Federation created the paradoxical situation of having a white elite owning most of the land and capital, whilst using cheap black labour', '  The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was dissolved on 1 January 1964', ' However, it was expected that only Nyasaland would be let go, whilst the remainder of Rhodesia both north and south would be united', ' Although Northern Rhodesia had a white population of over 100,000, as well as additional British military and civil units and their dependents, most of these were relatively new to the region, were primarily in the extraction business, had little landed interests, and were more amenable to allowing black nationalism than the Southern Rhodesians', ' Accordingly, Britain granted independence to Northern Rhodesia on 24 October 1964', ' However, when the new nationalists changed its name to Zambia and began tentatively at first and later in rapid march an Africanisation campaign, Southern Rhodesia remained a British colony, resisting attempts to bring in majority rule', ' The colony attempted to change its name to Rhodesia although this was not recognised by the United Kingdom', "" The majority of the Federation's military and financial assets went to Southern Rhodesia, since the British Government did not wish to see them fall into the hands of the nationalist leaders, and since Southern Rhodesia had borne the major expenses of running the Federation"", ' With regard to the latter, however, Northern Rhodesia was the wealthiest of the three member states (due to its vast copper mines) and had contributed more to the overall building of infrastructure than the other two members did', ' Southern Rhodesia, recognising an inevitable dissolution of the Federation, was quick to use federal funds in building its infrastructure ahead of the others', ' A key component of this was the building of the Kariba Dam and its hydroelectric facility (shafts, control centre, etc', '), which was situated on the Southern Rhodesian side of the Zambezi Gorge', ' This situation caused some embarrassment for the Zambian government later when it was a ""front line state"" in support of insurgents into Rhodesia in that its major source of electric power was controlled by the Rhodesian state', '  Return to ""Rhodesia""  With the protectorate of Northern Rhodesia no longer in existence, in 1964 Southern Rhodesia reverted to the name Rhodesia (see next section)', '  In 1965, Rhodesia unilaterally declared itself independent

(Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army and Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army)"", '  The Salisbury government, realizing the situation was untenable, and facing strong international pressure, concluded the Internal Settlement with black nationalist leaders in March 1978', '  A general election a year later resulted in the creation of a unity government, which in December 1979 concluded the Lancaster House Agreement, whereby Britain resumed control of the country for a brief period before granting independence to the renamed Zimbabwe on 18 April 1980', '  Legal aspects of the name since 1964  On 7 October 1964 the Southern Rhodesian government announced that when Northern Rhodesia achieved independence as Zambia, the Southern Rhodesian government would officially become known as the

Lobengula, but the king escaped and left Bulawayo in ruins behind him', '  An attempt to bring the king and his forces to submit led to the disaster of the Shangani Patrol when a Ndebele Impi defeated a British South Africa Company patrol led by Major Allan Wilson at the Shangani river in December 1893', ' Except for Frederick Russell Burnham and two other scouts sent for reinforcements, the

already, in 1884, published a book called ""Reconnaissance and Scouting""', ' In mid-June 1896, while scouting in the Matobo Hills, Burnham passed on to Baden-Powell aspects of woodcraft he had acquired in America, and it was during this time with Burnham that perhaps the seeds were sown for the program and the code of honour eventually crystallised in Baden-Powell\'s 1899 ""Aids to Scouting for NCOs and Men"" and his later (1908) ""Scouting for Boys"", which was written after his experience of how useful and reliable the boys at Mafeking had been', ' Practiced by frontiersmen of the American Old West and Indigenous peoples of the Americas, woodcraft was generally unknown to the British', ' These skills eventually formed the basis of what is now called scoutcraft, the fundamentals of Scouting', ' Baden-Powell recognised that wars in Africa were changing markedly and the British Army needed to adapt; so during their joint scouting missions, Baden-Powell and Burnham discussed the concept of a broad training programme in woodcraft for young men, rich in exploration, tracking, fieldcraft, and self-reliance', ' It was also during these scouting missions in the Matobo Hills that Baden-Powell first started to wear his signature campaign hat like the one worn by Burnham', ' Later, Baden-Powell wrote a number of books on Scouting, and even started to train and make use of adolescent boys, most famously during the Siege of Mafeking, during the Second Boer War', '  British Rule  British settlement of Rhodesia continued, and by October 1923, the territory of Southern Rhodesia was annexed to the Crown', ' The Ndebele thereby became British subjects and the colony received its first basic constitution and first parliamentary election', "" Ten years later, the British South Africa Company ceded its mineral rights to the territory's government for £2 million"", '  The deep recession of the 1930s gave way to a post-war boom of British immigration', '  After the onset of self-government, a major issue in Southern Rhodesia was the relationship between the white settlers and the Ndebele and Shona populations', ' One major consequence was the white settlers were able to enact discriminatory legislation concerning land tenure', ' The Land Apportionment and Tenure Acts reserved 45% of the land area for exclusively white ownership', ' 25% was designated ""Tribal Trust Land"", which was available to be worked on a collective basis by the already settled farmers and where individual title was not offered', '  In 1965, the white government of Rhodesia, led by Prime Minister Ian Smith, unilaterally declared independence from Britain — only the second state to do so, the other being the United States in 1776', ' Initially, the state proclaimed its loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II as ""Queen of Rhodesia"" (a title to which she never consented), but by 1970 even that link was severed, and Rhodesia claimed to be an independent republic', ' This was not recognised by any other state in the world; legally, Rhodesia remained a British colony', '  Sovereign Rhodesia  The ruling white Rhodesian government did not gain international recognition and faced serious economic problems as a result of sanctions', ' Some states, such as South Africa and Portugal, did support the white minority government of Rhodesia', ' In 1967, the Zimbabwe African

in Ndebele language) by supporters of the rebels', ' The Shona, backed by China, set up a separate war front from neighbouring Mozambique', '  The Rhodesian government agreed to a ceasefire in 1979',

college for Africans had become increasingly urgent, and within a few weeks of his translation from the Bloemfontein Diocese, Bishop Alderson began to investigate ways of meeting it', ' At the same time Canon Robert Grinham had been working to see the existence of schools for Africans whose facilities equaled or approximated to those of Ruzawi, Springvale and Peterhouse', ' To this end he devoted his energies after his retirement from Springvale', '  The Rt Rev Cecil Alderson, then Bishop of Mashonaland and Canon Robert Grinham, raised one hundred British pounds with which they formed the Bernard Mizeki Schools Trust which was then mandated to establish schools', ' The trust deed was prepared at Honey and Blackenberg and registered in 1959 while another trust with the same name was registered in the United Kingdom in July 1962 under trust number 313889', ' A pledge of forty thousand pounds was then made to Bishop Alderson at the Lambeth Conference in London so that the project could be realized', ' A significant chunk of that money is believed to have come from the Beit Trust and then anonymous individuals well wishers banks and corporates', ""  It was intended to be a multiracial, elite boys' school, an 'African Eton', and was strongly supported by the Anglican Church and a number of Federation businesses"", ' With the support of the Governor General of The

started in 1960 with the arrival Bruce Berrington, together with some artisans who had built Peterhouse', "" The school was sited amidst brachystegia woodland, a bird-watcher's paradise, and among the baboon and dassie inhabited granite bouldered kopjes that are so typical of Zimbabwe at what is known as the Bovey Tracey Estate"", ' This had been the site of St Bernards School since 1891', '  The school was intended to appeal to the upper African class and charged fees three to four times higher than ordinary mission schools', ' The first head to be appointed, Peter Holmes Canham a civil servant, came from British West Africa (Ghana)', ' Canham was described as a passionate and charismatic figure eccentric with a fiery, if short-lived, temper', ' Canham arrived in September 1960 to take up the headship of the college', ' Upon the commencement of the construction of the College Canon David Neaum left St Bernards Mission for Chikwaka Mission protesting against the construction of the school due to what he considered as the importation of elitism into an Africa crying out for universal education, especially of girls, was iniquitous', '  By the time Father Andrew Hunt retired the enrolment had risen to 320 boys, he relocated to Mutare and became board chair for St Davids Bonda in Mutare', ' Due to the liberation war at that time the expansion of Bernard Mizeki College

the incident at Musami, the Rev', ' L', ' Davies was advised by the local police to leave the school as they could not guarantee his safety and that of the students', ' The board of governors immediately appointed Mr', ' Chiadzwa to take over as headmaster of the college avoiding having to completely shutdown the school as other schools like Eagle School in Manicaland which closed in 1976   Governance Bernard Mizeki College is run through the Bernard Mizeki Schools Trust which was founded in 1959 by Canon Robert Grinham and Rt Rev Cecil Alderson', '  Peter Canham, made Bernard Mizeki College such an exceptionally good school', ' As a private school, it was his task, along with the governors, to raise the money to build, staff and ensure the future of the school', ' An ex-colonial civil servant, he ran the place with superb efficiency, leaving the teachers free to get on with their jobs', "" He had strong views on what an 'education' was"", "" In the days when 'blacks' (the other racial groups were 'whites' and 'coloureds') were only allowed into one of Salisbury, the capital's large hotels, he took the prefects to the Ambassador's and made them sit down to a full evening meal - so they could learn the etiquette of 'public' eating"", '  At the time of founding, there were several committees put in place to ensure the establishment of the college was a success', ' At the very top there were the Patrons of the college the three patrons were The Governor-General of Southern Rhodesia The Rt', ' Honourable Earl of Dalhousie, The Governor of Southern Rhodesia Sir

for 4 years and was succeeded by Reverend R', ' Glazebrook', ' The two schools (the college for secondary education, the school for primary) were under the same Board of Governors', ' The schools were heavily aided by the Ministry of African Education of Southern Rhodesia Government', ' Planned expansion was slowed down for a time by the lack of financial Support, but by 1963 the number of pupils reached 180 in the college and 140 in the school', ' Boys who had passed through primary school would automatically qualify to attend the college', ' Under the headmastership of Mr', ' P', ""

"" Canham being a seasoned civil servant from the Gold Coast now Ghana, his career as an administrator in the Gold Coast began in the late 1930s and concluded with the colony's independence as Ghana in 1957"", ' Upon attaining Independence of the Gold Coast Peter Holmes Canham moved to Southern Rhodesia where he took headmastership of Bernard Mizeki College', ' His most notable influence on the college was how he introduced systems of good governance amongst students', "" He introduced a Students Senate where the prefect's body was elected officials from the hostels they resided"", ' Elections and campaigns were held every year to select new senators', ' This led to the college producing an unusually high number of business leaders, lawyers, and politicians', ' According to one former staff member ""It was because of my experiences at the school that I later went into teaching but I never again came across such an inspirational headteacher', ' Later, it was the lack of true leadership skills which made so many of the schools at which I taught for almost 30 years such disappointing places', '"" Due to the same architect and artisans who had built Peterhouse being contracted in the construction of Bernard Mizeki College a few of the buildings between the two schools began to look a lot similar', ' This resulted in a heated argument between F', 'R', ' Snell, first rector of Peterhouse and Peter Canham', ' F', ' R', ' Snell accused Peter Canham of copying building Plans of Peterhouse', ' In 1964 Peter Canham Left Bernard Mizeki College after some disagreements with the Board of Governors and went on to head schools in Uganda, took up principalships of teacher training colleges in Western and Northern Nigeria, and finally to teaching Third World Studies in the Institutes of Education at the Universities of London and Cardiff', ' He retired from Cardiff in June 1981, but his retirement was soon clouded by ill-health, and he died in

' In the same year the college attained an 86', '11% pass rate with 71 boys having sat for the ZIMSEC Ordinary Level examinations and was ranked 29th nationally', ' These results sparked an outcry among parents and the former students who demanded the school to improve its performance in public examinations', '  Recent Challenges In November 2015 the cabinet adopted a civil services report which recommended the withdrawal of funding for teacher salaries employed at private schools due to the current Economic meltdown in Zimbabwe', ' The government grant was used to pay salaries for seventeen teachers stationed at Bernard Mizeki College', ' The government argued that teachers at private schools alone gobbled about $70 million United States dollars in salaries and allowances', '

immediately suspended by the Rhodesians, with Smith calling Nkomo a ""monster""', ' On 10 September, Smith announced the extension of martial law over selected areas', ' The Rhodesian Security Forces launched several retaliatory strikes into Zambia and Mozambique over the following months, attacking both ZIPRA and its rival, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA)', ' The attack on ZIPRA in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were refugees camping in and around guerrilla positions', ' In February 1979, ZIPRA shot down Air Rhodesia Flight 827, another

self-governing colony of Rhodesia led the colonial government, headed by Prime Minister Ian Smith, to unilaterally declare independence from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965', ' The idea of ""no independence before majority rule"" had recently gained ground in Britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation, and Rhodesia\'s government was dominated by the country\'s white minority, so the unilateral declaration went unrecognised internationally', ' Britain and the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia', ""  Two rival communist-backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule: the Chinese-aligned Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), mostly comprising Shonas, created the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and adopted aspects of Maoist doctrine, while the Ndebele-dominated Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), aligned with Soviet-style Marxism–Leninism and the Warsaw Pact, mobilised the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA)"", ';   These guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the ""Second Chimurenga"" against the Rhodesian government and security forces', ' The resulting conflict, the Rhodesian Bush War, began in earnest in December 1972, when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms in north-eastern Rhodesia', ""  After the security forces mounted a successful counter-insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974, developments overseas caused the conflict's momentum to shift in the insurgents' favour"", "" The leftist Carnation Revolution of April 1974 caused Portugal to withdraw its key economic support for Smith's administration, and led to Mozambique's independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with ZANU"", "" Around the same time, Rhodesia's other main backer, South Africa, adopted a détente initiative that forced a ceasefire, giving the guerrillas time to regroup"", ' Following the abortive Victoria Falls Conference of August 1975, Smith and the ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo held unsuccessful talks between December 1975 and March 1976', ' ZANU and ZAPU announced in October 1976, during the run-up to the unsuccessful Geneva Conference in December, that they would henceforth attend conferences as a joint ""Patriotic Front""', '  In March 1978, Smith and non-militant nationalist groups headed by Bishop Abel Muzorewa, the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole and Chief Jeremiah Chirau agreed what became the ""Internal Settlement""', ' This created a joint black–white transitional government, with the country due to be reconstituted as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, pursuant to multiracial elections', ' ZANU and ZAPU were invited to participate, but refused; Nkomo sardonically dubbed Smith\'s black colleagues ""the blacksmiths""', ' ZANU proclaimed 1978 to be ""The Year of the People"" as the war continued', "" Officials from Muzorewa's United African National Council, sent to the provinces to explain the Internal Settlement to rural blacks, were killed by Marxist–Leninist guerrillas"", ' Insurgents also began to target Christian missionaries, climaxing in the killing of nine British missionaries and four children at Elim Mission near the Mozambican border in the Vumba massacre on 23 June', '  The transitional government was badly received abroad, partly because the Internal Settlement kept control of law enforcement, the military, the judiciary and the civil service under white control', "" No country recognised Rhodesia's interim administration"", ' Smith again worked to bring Nkomo into the government, hoping this would lend it some credence domestically, prompt diplomatic recognition overseas, and help the security forces defeat ZANLA', ' Starting on 14 August 1978, he attended secret meetings with Nkomo in Lusaka, Zambia (where ZAPU was based), doing so with the assistance of the mining corporation Lonrho', ' Attempts were made to also involve the ZANU leader Robert Mugabe, but Mugabe would have no part in the talks', ' According to the South African military historian Jakkie Cilliers, negotiations between Smith and Nkomo progressed well and

(BSAC), would administer the territory stretching from the Limpopo to Lake Tanganyika under charter as a protectorate"", ' Queen Victoria signed the charter in 1889', ' Rhodes used this document in 1890 to justify sending the Pioneer Column, a group of white settlers protected by well-armed British South Africa Police (BSAP) and guided by the big game hunter Frederick Selous, through Matabeleland and into Shona territory to establish Fort Salisbury (now Harare)', ' In 1893–1894, with the help of their new Maxim guns, the BSAP defeated the Ndebele in the First Matabele War, a war which also resulted in the death of King Lobengula and the death of most of the members of the Shangani Patrol', ' Shortly after the disastrous BSAP Jameson Raid into the Transvaal Republic, the Ndebele were led by their spiritual leader Mlimo against the white colonials and thus began the Second Matabele War (1896–97) which resulted in the extermination of nearly half the British settlers', ' After months of bloodshed, Mlimo was found and shot by the American scout Frederick Russell Burnham and soon thereafter Rhodes walked unarmed into the Ndebele stronghold in Matobo Hills and persuaded the impi to lay down their arms, effectively ending the revolt', ""  A legislative council was created in 1899 to manage the company's civil affairs, with a minority of elected seats, through which the BSAC had to pass government measures"", ' As the company was a British institution in which settlers and capitalists owned most shares, and local black African tribal chiefs the remainder, and the electorate to this council was limited to those shareholders, the electorate was almost exclusively white settlers', ' Over time as more settlers arrived and a growing number had less than the amount of land required to own a share in the company or where in trades supporting the company as workers, successive activism resulted in first increasing the proportion of elected seats, and eventually allowing non-share holders the right to vote in the election', ' Prior to about 1918, the opinion among the electorate supported continued BSAC rule but opinion changed because of the development of the country and increased settlement', ' In addition, a decision in the British courts that land not in private ownership belonged to the British Crown rather than the BSAC gave great impetus to the campaign for self-government', ' In the resulting treaty government self-government, Crown lands which were sold to settlers allowed those settlers the right to vote in the

for expanding the self-government of the Rhodesian people which saw BSAC rule as an impediment to further expansion', '  The Southern Rhodesian Legislative Council election of 1920 returned a large majority of candidates of the Responsible Government Association and it became clear that BSAC rule was no longer practical', ' Opinion in the United Kingdom and South Africa favoured incorporation of

Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi, respectively)', ' The idea was to try to steer a middle road between the differing aspirations of the black nationalists, the colonial administration and the white settler population', ' The CAF sought to emulate the experience of Australia, Canada and South Africa – wherein groups of colonies had been federated together to form viable independent nations', ' Originally designed to be ""an indissoluble federation"", the CAF quickly started to unravel due to the low proportion of British and other white citizens in relation to the larger black populations', ' Additionally, by incorporating the tribes within the Federation as potential citizens, the Federation created the paradoxical situation of having a white elite owning most of the land and capital, whilst using cheap black labour', '  The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was dissolved on 1 January 1964', ' However, it was expected that only Nyasaland would be let go, whilst the remainder of Rhodesia both north and south would be united', ' Although Northern Rhodesia had a white population of over 100,000, as well as additional British military and civil units and their dependents, most of these were relatively new to the region, were primarily in the extraction business, had little landed interests, and were more amenable to allowing black nationalism than the Southern Rhodesians', ' Accordingly, Britain granted independence to Northern Rhodesia on 24 October 1964', ' However, when the new nationalists changed its name to Zambia and began tentatively at first and later in rapid march an Africanisation campaign, Southern Rhodesia remained a British colony, resisting attempts to bring in majority rule', ' The colony attempted to change its name to Rhodesia although this was not recognised by the United Kingdom', "" The majority of the Federation's military and financial assets went to Southern Rhodesia, since the British Government did not wish to see them fall into the hands of the nationalist leaders, and since Southern Rhodesia had borne the major expenses of running the Federation"", ' With regard to the latter, however, Northern Rhodesia was the wealthiest of the three member states (due to its vast copper mines) and had contributed more to the overall building of infrastructure than the other two members did', ' Southern Rhodesia, recognising an inevitable dissolution of the Federation, was quick to use federal funds in building its infrastructure ahead of the others', ' A key component of this was the building of the Kariba Dam and its hydroelectric facility (shafts, control centre, etc', '), which was situated on the Southern Rhodesian side of the Zambezi Gorge', ' This situation caused some embarrassment for the Zambian government later when it was a ""front line state"" in support of insurgents into Rhodesia in that its major source of electric power was controlled by the Rhodesian state', '  Return to ""Rhodesia""  With the protectorate of Northern Rhodesia no longer in existence, in 1964 Southern Rhodesia reverted to the name Rhodesia (see next section)', '  In 1965, Rhodesia unilaterally declared itself independent

of the Bakalanga people were incorporated to create a large state called Ndebele Kingdom', ' Mzilikazi organised this ethnically diverse nation into a militaristic system of regimental towns and established his capital at Bulawayo (""the place of killing"")', ' Mzilikazi was a statesman of considerable stature, able to weld the many conquered tribes into a strong, centralised kingdom', '  In 1840, Matabeleland was founded', '  In 1852, the Boer government in the Transvaal made a treaty with Mzilikazi', ' Gold was discovered in northern Ndebele in 1867', ' The area, settled by the Zezuru people, remnants of the Mwenemutapa kingdom, while the European powers increasingly became interested in the region', ' Mzilikazi died on 9 September 1868, near Bulawayo', ' His son, Lobengula, succeeded him as king', "" In exchange for wealth and arms, Lobengula granted several concessions to the British, but it was not until twenty years later that the most prominent of these, the 1888 Rudd Concession gave Cecil Rhodes exclusive mineral rights in much of the lands east of Lobengula's main territory"", ' Gold was already known to exist, but with the Rudd concession, Rhodes was able in 1889 to obtain a Royal Charter to form the British South Africa Company', '  British South Africa Company  In 1890, Rhodes sent a group of settlers, known as the Pioneer Column, into Mashonaland where they founded Fort Salisbury (now Harare)', ' In 1891 an Order-in-Council declared Matabeleland and Mashonaland British protectorates', ' Rhodes had a vested interest in the continued expansion of white settlements in the region, so now with the cover of a legal mandate, he used a brutal attack by Ndebele against the Shona near Fort Victoria (now Masvingo) in 1893 as a pretext for attacking the kingdom of Lobengula', ' Also in 1893, a concession awarded to Sir John Swinburne was detached from Matabeleland to be administered by the British Resident Commissioner of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, to which the territory was formally annexed in 1911 and it remains part of modern Botswana, known as the Tati Concessions Land', '   First Matabele War   [[File:Battle of the Shangani', 'jpg|thumb|left|Battle between British soldiers and Matabele (Richard Caton Woodville)]] The first decisive battle was fought on 1 November 1893, when a laager was attacked on open ground near the Bembesi River by Imbizo and Ingubo regiments', ' The laager consisted of 670 British soldiers, 400 of whom were mounted along with a small force of native allies, and fought off the Imbizo and Ingubo forces, which were considered by Sir John Willoughby to number 1,700 warriors in all', ' The laager had with it small artillery: 5 Maxim guns, 2 seven-pounders, 1 Gardner gun, and 1 Hotchkiss gun', ' The Maxim machine guns took center stage and decimated the native force at the Battle of the Shangani', ""  Although Lobengula's forces totaled 8,000 spearmen and 2,000 riflemen, versus fewer than 700 soldiers of the British South Africa Police, the Ndebele warriors were not equipped to match the British machine guns"", ' Leander Starr Jameson sent his troops to Bulawayo to try to capture Lobengula, but the king escaped and left Bulawayo in ruins behind him', '  An attempt to bring the king and his forces to submit led to the disaster of the Shangani Patrol when a Ndebele Impi defeated a British South Africa Company patrol led by Major Allan Wilson at the Shangani river in December 1893', ' Except for Frederick Russell Burnham and two other scouts sent for reinforcements, the detachment was surrounded and wiped out', ' This incident had a lasting influence on Matabeleland nationalism and spirit of resistance and the colonists who died in this battle are buried at Matobo Hills along with Jameson and Cecil Rhodes', "" In white Rhodesian history, Wilson's battle takes on the status of General Custer's stand at Little Big Horn in the United States"", ' The Matabele fighters honoured the dead men with a salute to their bravery in battle and reportedly told the king, ""They were men of men and their fathers were men before them', '""  Lobengula died in January 1894, under mysterious circumstances; within a few short months the British South Africa Company controlled Matabeleland, and white settlers continued to arrive', '  Second Matebele War  In March 1896, the Ndebele revolted against the authority of the British South Africa Company in what is now celebrated in Zimbabwe as the First Chimurenga, i', 'e', ', First War of Independence', ' Mlimo, the Ndebele spiritual/religious leader, is credited with fomenting much of the anger that led to this confrontation', ' He convinced the Ndebele that the white settlers (almost 4,000 strong by then) were responsible for the drought, locust plagues and the cattle disease rinderpest ravaging the country at the time', ""  Mlimo's call to battle was well-timed"", "" Only a few months earlier, the British South Africa Company's Administrator General for Matabeleland, Leander Starr Jameson, had sent most of his troops and armaments to fight the Transvaal Republic in the ill-fated Jameson Raid"", "" This left the country's security in disarray"", ' In June 1896, the Shona too joined the war, but they stayed mostly on the defensive', ' The British would immediately send troops to suppress the Ndebele and the Shona, only it would take months and cost many hundreds of lives before the territory would be once again be at peace', ' Shortly after learning of the assassination of Mlimo at the hands of the American scout Frederick Russell Burnham, Cecil Rhodes walked unarmed into the Ndebele stronghold in Matobo Hills and persuaded the impi to lay down their arms, thus bringing the war to a close in October 1896', ' Matabeleland and Mashonaland would continue on only as provinces of the larger state of Rhodesia', '  Birthplace of Scouting [[File:Burnham sketch by baden-powell',

founder of the Scout Movement, and the younger Frederick Russell Burnham, the American born Chief of Scouts for the British Army, first met and began their lifelong friendship', ' Baden-Powell had already, in 1884, published a book called ""Reconnaissance and Scouting""', ' In mid-June 1896, while scouting in the Matobo Hills, Burnham passed on to Baden-Powell aspects of woodcraft he had acquired in America, and it was during this time with Burnham that perhaps the seeds were sown for the program and the code of honour eventually crystallised in Baden-Powell\'s 1899 ""Aids to Scouting for NCOs and Men"" and his later (1908) ""Scouting for Boys"", which was written after his experience of how useful and reliable the boys at Mafeking had been', ' Practiced by frontiersmen of the American Old West and Indigenous peoples of the Americas, woodcraft was generally unknown to the British', ' These skills eventually formed the basis of what is now called scoutcraft, the fundamentals of Scouting', ' Baden-Powell recognised that wars in Africa were changing markedly and the British Army needed to adapt; so during their joint scouting missions, Baden-Powell and Burnham discussed the concept of a broad training programme in woodcraft for young men, rich in exploration, tracking, fieldcraft, and self-reliance', ' It was also during these scouting missions in the Matobo Hills that Baden-Powell first started to wear his signature campaign hat like the one worn by Burnham', ' Later, Baden-Powell wrote a number of books on Scouting, and even started to train and make use of adolescent boys, most famously during the Siege of Mafeking, during the Second Boer War', '  British Rule  British settlement of Rhodesia continued, and by October 1923, the territory of Southern Rhodesia was annexed to the Crown', ' The Ndebele thereby became British subjects and the colony received its first basic constitution and first parliamentary election', "" Ten years later, the British South Africa Company ceded its mineral rights to the territory's government for £2 million"", '  The deep recession of the 1930s gave way to a post-war boom of British immigration', '  After the onset of self-government, a major issue in Southern Rhodesia was the relationship between the white settlers and the Ndebele and Shona populations', ' One major consequence was the white settlers were able to enact discriminatory legislation concerning land tenure', ' The Land Apportionment and Tenure Acts reserved 45% of the land area for exclusively white ownership', ' 25% was designated ""Tribal Trust Land"", which was available to be worked on a collective basis by the already settled farmers and where individual title was not offered', '  In 1965, the white government of Rhodesia, led by Prime Minister Ian Smith, unilaterally declared independence from Britain — only the second state to do so, the other being the United States in 1776', ' Initially, the state proclaimed its loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II as ""Queen of Rhodesia"" (a title to which she never consented), but by 1970 even that link was severed, and Rhodesia claimed to be an independent republic', ' This was not recognised by any other state in the world; legally, Rhodesia remained a British colony', '  Sovereign Rhodesia  The ruling white Rhodesian government did not gain international recognition and faced serious economic problems as a result of sanctions', ' Some states, such as South Africa and Portugal, did support the white minority government of Rhodesia', ' In 1967, the Zimbabwe African People\'s Union began a lengthy armed campaign against Rhodesia\'s white minority government in what became known as the ""Bush War"" by White Rhodesians and as the ""Second Umvukela"" (or rebellion in Ndebele language) by supporters of the rebels', ' The Shona, backed by China, set up a separate war front from neighbouring Mozambique', '  The Rhodesian government agreed to a ceasefire in 1979', ' For a brief period, Rhodesia reverted to the status of British colony, until early 1980 when elections were held', ' The ZANU party, led by the Shona independence leader Robert Mugabe, defeated the popular Ndebele candidate Joshua Nkomo, solidified their rule over independent Zimbabwe', ' The former state of Matabeleland and Mashonaland now exist as provinces of Zimbabwe, but the former, after suffering a genocide after independence at the hands of the latter,  Zimbabwe  Following independence in 1980, Zimbabwe initially made significant economic and social progress,   Gukurahundi Genocide 1983-87  Gukurahundi was a series of massacres of Northern Ndebele people (formerly known as Matabele) carried out by the Zimbabwe National Army from early 1983 to late 1987', ' The International Association of Genocide Scholars estimates that more than 20,000 people were killed and have classified the massacres as a genocide', '  By early 1984, the army disrupted food supplies in Matabeleland and much of the Ndebele population suffered food shortages', ' Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo finally reconciled their political differences by late 1987', "" The roots of discord remained, however, and in some ways increased as Mugabe's rule became increasingly autocratic into the 21st century"", '  In the early 1990s, a Land Acquisition Act was passed, calling for the Mugabe government to purchase mostly white-owned commercial farming land for redistribution to native Africans', ' Matabeleland has rich central plains, watered by tributaries of the Zambezi and Limpopo rivers, allowing it to sustain cattle and consistently produce large amounts of cotton and maize', "" But land grabbing, squatting, and repossessions of large commercial farms under Mugabe's program resulted in a 90%

boys though it had been set up with the view of it becoming a multiracial international school', ',  The founders had seen the winds of change sweeping across Africa and felt they had to provide high quality education, equivalent to what Europeans were receiving, for the future leaders of an independent Rhodesia', ' The whole idea behind the school was to bring up well-rounded African leaders in areas of finance, industry, business, education, medicine, law, military and politics', ' Rt', ' Reverend Cecil Alderson, like his predecessor Bishop Edward Paget,  realised the need for a senior college for Africans had become increasingly urgent, and within a few weeks of his translation from the Bloemfontein Diocese, Bishop Alderson began to investigate ways of meeting it', ' At the same time Canon Robert Grinham had been working to see the existence of schools for Africans whose facilities equaled or approximated to those of Ruzawi, Springvale and Peterhouse', ' To this end he devoted his energies after his retirement from Springvale', '  The Rt Rev Cecil Alderson, then Bishop of Mashonaland and Canon Robert Grinham, raised one hundred British pounds with which they formed the Bernard Mizeki Schools Trust which was then mandated to establish schools', ' The trust deed was prepared at Honey and Blackenberg and registered in 1959 while another trust with the same name was registered in the United Kingdom in July 1962 under trust number 313889', ' A pledge of forty thousand pounds was then made to Bishop Alderson at the Lambeth Conference in London so that the project could be realized', ' A significant chunk of that money is believed to have come from the Beit Trust and then anonymous individuals well wishers banks and corporates', ""  It was intended to be a multiracial, elite boys' school, an 'African Eton', and was strongly supported by the Anglican Church and a number of Federation businesses"", ' With the support of the Governor General of The Federation of Rhodesia funding in the early days was not a challenge  Architectural designs and a master plan of the school were done by John Vigour in 1959', ' The actual construction of the college started in 1960 with the arrival Bruce Berrington, together with some artisans who had built Peterhouse', "" The school was sited amidst brachystegia woodland, a bird-watcher's paradise, and among the baboon and dassie inhabited granite bouldered kopjes that are so typical of Zimbabwe at what is known as the Bovey Tracey Estate"", ' This had been the site of St Bernards School since 1891', '  The school was intended to appeal to the upper African class and charged fees three to four times higher than ordinary mission schools', ' The first head to be appointed, Peter Holmes Canham a civil servant, came from British West Africa (Ghana)', ' Canham was described as a passionate and charismatic figure eccentric with a fiery, if short-lived, temper', ' Canham arrived in September 1960 to take up the headship of the college', ' Upon the commencement of the construction of the College Canon David Neaum left St Bernards Mission for Chikwaka Mission protesting against the construction of the school due to what he considered as the importation of elitism into an Africa crying out for universal education, especially of girls, was iniquitous', '  By the time Father Andrew Hunt retired the enrolment had risen to 320 boys, he relocated to Mutare and became board chair for St Davids Bonda in Mutare', ' Due to the liberation war at that time the expansion of Bernard Mizeki College stalled for a number of years the Ministry was no longer providing funds for the schools expansion', ' After Father Hunt left, the Rev', ' Leslie Davies was appointed to the post of Headmaster of Bernard Mizeki College', ' Unfortunately his term of office did not last long because of the murders of surrounding farmers and a number of priests and nuns at the nearby St', ' Pauls Musami', ' After the incident at Musami, the Rev', ' L', ' Davies was advised by the local police to leave the school as they could not guarantee his safety and that of the students', ' The board of governors immediately appointed Mr', ' Chiadzwa to take over as headmaster of the college avoiding having to completely shutdown the school as other schools like Eagle School in Manicaland which closed in 1976   Governance Bernard Mizeki College is run through the Bernard Mizeki Schools Trust which was founded in 1959 by Canon Robert Grinham and Rt Rev Cecil Alderson', '  Peter Canham, made Bernard Mizeki College such an exceptionally good school', ' As a private school, it was his task, along with the governors, to raise the money to build, staff and ensure the future of the school', ' An ex-colonial civil servant, he ran the place with superb efficiency, leaving the teachers free to get on with their jobs', "" He had strong views on what an 'education' was"", "" In the days when 'blacks' (the other racial groups were 'whites' and 'coloureds') were only allowed into one of Salisbury, the capital's large hotels, he took the prefects to the Ambassador's and made them sit down to a full evening meal - so they could learn the etiquette of 'public' eating"", '  At the time of founding, there were several committees put in place to ensure the establishment of the college was a success', ' At the very top there were the Patrons of the college the three patrons were The Governor-General of Southern Rhodesia The Rt', ' Honourable Earl of Dalhousie, The Governor of Southern Rhodesia Sir Humphrey Gibbs and Sir Ellis Robins', '  the College Trustees was made up of leading lawyers, business persons, and senior civil servants', ' one of the trustees was Robert stumbles of Stumbles and

college was under the headmastership of Peter Holmes Canham, whilst the Bernard Mizeki Primary School was under the headmastership of Mr', ' G', 'F', ' Coney', ' Canham headed Bernard Mizeki College for 4 years and was succeeded by Reverend R', ' Glazebrook', ' The two schools (the college for secondary education, the school for primary) were under the same Board of Governors', ' The schools were heavily aided by the Ministry of African Education of Southern Rhodesia Government', ' Planned expansion was slowed down for a time by the lack of financial Support, but by 1963 the number of pupils reached 180 in the college and 140 in the school', ' Boys who had passed through primary school would automatically qualify to attend the college', ' Under the headmastership of Mr', ' P', "" Nheweyembwa the college has embarked on a number of developmental projects thus the college was awarded the Secretary's Bell Merit Award for Best School in Mashonaland East for 2014"", '  Mr Peter H', "" Canham being a seasoned civil servant from the Gold Coast now Ghana, his career as an administrator in the Gold Coast began in the late 1930s and concluded with the colony's independence as Ghana in 1957"", ' Upon attaining Independence of the Gold Coast Peter Holmes Canham moved to Southern Rhodesia where he took headmastership of Bernard Mizeki College', ' His most notable influence on the college was how he introduced systems of good governance amongst students', "" He introduced a Students Senate where the prefect's body was elected officials from the hostels they resided"", ' Elections and campaigns were held every year to select new senators', ' This led to the college producing an unusually high number of business leaders, lawyers, and politicians', ' According to one former staff member ""It was because of my experiences at the school that I later went into teaching but I never again came across such an inspirational headteacher', ' Later, it was the lack of true leadership skills which made so many of the schools at which I taught for almost 30 years such disappointing places', '"" Due to the same architect and artisans who had built Peterhouse being contracted in the construction of Bernard Mizeki College a few of the buildings between the two schools began to look a lot similar', ' This resulted in a heated argument between F', 'R', ' Snell, first rector of Peterhouse and Peter Canham', ' F', ' R', ' Snell accused Peter Canham of copying building Plans of Peterhouse', ' In 1964 Peter Canham Left Bernard Mizeki College after some disagreements with the Board of Governors and went on to head schools in Uganda, took up principalships of teacher training colleges in Western and Northern Nigeria, and finally to teaching Third World Studies in the Institutes of Education at the Universities of London and Cardiff', ' He retired from Cardiff in June 1981, but his retirement was soon clouded by ill-health, and he died in October 1984', '  Motto and school badge The college\'s motto is in  and means ""I have liberated my mind""', '  The school badge was designed by a Mr Watambwa who was one of the artisans involved in the construction of the college in 1960', ' The badge depicts a shield with a cross on it with two spears running down across at slanted angle', "" A martyr's crown sits atop the cross"", "" The college's motto is printed on a ribbon below the shield"", '  Academic The college aims to provide an academic curriculum that provides pupils with a broad-based educational experience', ' Introduction of more specialised subjects has taken place in the last few years the options available enable pupils to take a combination of academic or commercial or practical subjects', ' In the 2014 academic year Bernard Mizeki College was ranked 53rd nationally and 7th in Mashonaland East Province attaining a pass rate of 96', '97% with a candidature of 33 boys for Advanced Level studies', ' In the same year the college attained an 86', '11% pass rate with 71 boys having sat for the ZIMSEC Ordinary Level examinations and was ranked 29th nationally', ' These results sparked an outcry among parents and the former students who demanded the school to improve its performance in public examinations', '  Recent Challenges In November 2015 the cabinet adopted a civil services report which recommended the withdrawal of funding for teacher salaries employed at private schools due to the current Economic meltdown in Zimbabwe', ' The government grant was used to pay salaries for seventeen teachers stationed at Bernard Mizeki College', ' The government argued that teachers at private schools alone gobbled about $70 million United States dollars in salaries and allowances', '

self-governing colony of Rhodesia led the colonial government, headed by Prime Minister Ian Smith, to unilaterally declare independence from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965', ' The idea of ""no independence before majority rule"" had recently gained ground in Britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation, and Rhodesia\'s government was dominated by the country\'s white minority, so the unilateral declaration went unrecognised internationally', ' Britain and the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia', ""  Two rival communist-backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule: the Chinese-aligned Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), mostly comprising Shonas, created the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and adopted aspects of Maoist doctrine, while the Ndebele-dominated Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), aligned with Soviet-style Marxism–Leninism and the Warsaw Pact, mobilised the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA)"", ';   These guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the ""Second Chimurenga"" against the Rhodesian government and security forces', ' The resulting conflict, the Rhodesian Bush War, began in earnest in December 1972, when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms in north-eastern Rhodesia', ""  After the security forces mounted a successful counter-insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974, developments overseas caused the conflict's momentum to shift in the insurgents' favour"", "" The leftist Carnation

with ZANU"", "" Around the same time, Rhodesia's other main backer, South Africa, adopted a détente initiative that forced a ceasefire, giving the guerrillas time to regroup"", ' Following the abortive Victoria Falls Conference of August 1975, Smith and the ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo held unsuccessful talks between December 1975 and March 1976', ' ZANU and ZAPU announced in October 1976,

groups headed by Bishop Abel Muzorewa, the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole and Chief Jeremiah Chirau agreed what became the ""Internal Settlement""', ' This created a joint black–white transitional government, with the country due to be reconstituted as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, pursuant to multiracial elections', ' ZANU and ZAPU were invited to participate, but refused; Nkomo sardonically dubbed Smith\'s black colleagues ""the blacksmiths""', ' ZANU proclaimed 1978 to be ""The Year of the People"" as the war continued', "" Officials from Muzorewa's United African National Council, sent to the provinces to explain the Internal Settlement to rural blacks, were killed by Marxist–Leninist guerrillas"", ' Insurgents also began to target Christian missionaries, climaxing in the killing of nine British missionaries and four children at Elim Mission near the Mozambican border in the Vumba massacre on 23 June', '  The transitional government was badly received abroad, partly because the Internal Settlement kept control of law enforcement, the military, the judiciary and the civil service under white control', "" No country recognised Rhodesia's interim administration"", ' Smith again worked to bring Nkomo into the government, hoping this would lend it some credence domestically, prompt diplomatic recognition overseas, and help the security forces defeat ZANLA', ' Starting on 14

(BSAC), would administer the territory stretching from the Limpopo to Lake Tanganyika under charter as a protectorate"", ' Queen Victoria signed the charter in 1889', ' Rhodes used this document in 1890 to justify sending the Pioneer Column, a group of white settlers protected by well-armed British South Africa Police (BSAP) and guided by the big game hunter Frederick Selous, through Matabeleland and into Shona territory to establish Fort Salisbury (now Harare)', ' In 1893–1894, with the help of their new Maxim guns, the BSAP defeated the Ndebele in the First Matabele War, a war which also resulted in the death of King Lobengula and the death of most of the members of the Shangani Patrol', ' Shortly after the disastrous BSAP Jameson Raid into the Transvaal Republic, the Ndebele were led by their spiritual leader Mlimo against the white colonials and thus began the Second Matabele War (1896–97) which resulted in the extermination of nearly half the British settlers', ' After months of bloodshed, Mlimo was found and shot by the American scout Frederick Russell Burnham and soon thereafter Rhodes walked unarmed into the Ndebele stronghold in Matobo Hills and persuaded the impi to lay down their arms, effectively ending the revolt', ""  A legislative council was created in 1899 to manage the company's civil affairs, with a minority of elected seats, through which the BSAC had to pass government measures"", ' As the company was a British institution in which settlers and capitalists owned most shares, and local black African tribal chiefs the remainder, and the electorate to this council was limited to those shareholders, the electorate was almost exclusively white settlers', ' Over time as more settlers arrived and a growing number had less than the amount of land required to own a share in the company or where in trades supporting the company as workers, successive activism resulted in first increasing the proportion of elected seats, and eventually allowing non-share holders the right to vote in the election', ' Prior to about 1918, the opinion among the electorate supported continued BSAC rule but opinion changed because of the development of the country and increased settlement', ' In addition, a decision in the British courts that land not in private ownership belonged to the British Crown rather than the BSAC gave great impetus to the campaign for self-government', ' In the resulting treaty government self-government, Crown lands which were sold to settlers allowed those settlers the right to vote in the

for expanding the self-government of the Rhodesian people which saw BSAC rule as an impediment to further expansion', '  The Southern Rhodesian Legislative Council election of 1920 returned a large majority of candidates of the Responsible Government Association and it became clear that BSAC rule was no longer practical', ' Opinion in the United Kingdom and South Africa favoured incorporation of Southern Rhodesia in the Union of South Africa, but, by forcing the pace of negotiation, the Southern Rhodesians obtained unfavourable terms and the electorate backed Responsible Government in a 1922

taking the white population up to 307,000', ' A large number of these immigrants were of British working-class origin', ' More settlers from the Belgian Congo, Kenya, Tanzania, and later Angola and

Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi, respectively)', ' The idea was to try to steer a middle road between the differing aspirations of the black nationalists, the colonial administration and the white settler population', ' The CAF sought to emulate the experience of Australia, Canada and South Africa – wherein groups of colonies had been federated together to form viable independent nations', ' Originally designed to be ""an indissoluble federation"", the CAF quickly started to unravel due to the low proportion of British and other white citizens in relation to the larger black populations', ' Additionally, by incorporating the tribes within the Federation as potential citizens, the Federation created the paradoxical situation of having a white elite owning most of the land and capital, whilst using cheap black labour', '  The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was dissolved on 1 January 1964', ' However, it was expected that only Nyasaland would be let go, whilst the remainder of Rhodesia both north and south would be united', ' Although Northern Rhodesia had a white population of over 100,000, as well as additional British military and civil units and their dependents, most of these were relatively new to the region, were primarily in the extraction business, had little landed interests, and were more amenable to allowing black nationalism than the Southern Rhodesians', ' Accordingly, Britain granted independence to Northern Rhodesia on 24 October 1964', ' However, when the new nationalists changed its name to Zambia and began tentatively at first and later in rapid march an Africanisation campaign, Southern Rhodesia remained a British colony, resisting attempts to bring in majority rule', ' The colony attempted to change its name to Rhodesia although this was not recognised by the United Kingdom', "" The majority of the Federation's military and financial assets went to Southern Rhodesia, since the British Government did not wish to see them fall into the hands of the nationalist leaders, and since Southern Rhodesia had borne the major expenses of running the Federation"", ' With regard to the latter, however, Northern Rhodesia was the wealthiest of the three member states (due to its vast copper mines) and had contributed more to the overall building of infrastructure than the other two members did', ' Southern Rhodesia, recognising an inevitable dissolution of the Federation, was quick to use federal funds in building its infrastructure ahead of the others', ' A key component of this was the building of the Kariba Dam and its hydroelectric facility (shafts, control centre, etc', '), which was situated on the Southern Rhodesian side of the Zambezi Gorge', ' This situation caused some embarrassment for the Zambian government later when it was a ""front line state"" in support of insurgents into Rhodesia in that its major source of electric power was controlled by the Rhodesian state', '  Return to ""Rhodesia""  With the protectorate of Northern Rhodesia no longer in existence, in 1964 Southern Rhodesia reverted to the name Rhodesia (see next section)', '  In 1965, Rhodesia unilaterally declared itself independent

the 15th century, the Bakalanga/vakaranga had established a strong empire at Khami under a powerful ruler called Dlembeu', ' This empire was split by the end of the 15th century and were later

of the Bakalanga people were incorporated to create a large state called Ndebele Kingdom', ' Mzilikazi organised this ethnically diverse nation into a militaristic system of regimental towns and established his capital at Bulawayo (""the place of killing"")', ' Mzilikazi was a statesman of considerable stature, able to weld the many conquered tribes into a strong, centralised kingdom', '  In 1840, Matabeleland was founded', '  In 1852, the Boer government in the Transvaal made a treaty with Mzilikazi', ' Gold was discovered in northern Ndebele in 1867', ' The area, settled by the Zezuru

succeeded him as king', "" In exchange for wealth and arms, Lobengula granted several concessions to the British, but it was not until twenty years later that the most prominent of these, the 1888 Rudd Concession gave Cecil Rhodes exclusive mineral rights in much of the lands east of Lobengula's main territory"", ' Gold was already known to exist, but with the Rudd concession, Rhodes was able in 1889 to obtain a Royal Charter to form the British South Africa Company', '  British South Africa Company  In 1890, Rhodes sent a group of settlers, known as the Pioneer Column, into Mashonaland where they founded Fort Salisbury (now Harare)', ' In 1891 an Order-in-Council declared Matabeleland and Mashonaland British protectorates', ' Rhodes had a vested interest in the continued expansion of white settlements in the region, so now with the cover of a legal mandate, he used a brutal attack by Ndebele against the Shona near Fort Victoria (now Masvingo) in 1893 as a pretext for attacking the kingdom of Lobengula', ' Also in 1893, a concession awarded to Sir John Swinburne was detached from Matabeleland to be administered by the British Resident Commissioner of the Bechuanaland

forces, which were considered by Sir John Willoughby to number 1,700 warriors in all', ' The laager had with it small artillery: 5 Maxim guns, 2 seven-pounders, 1 Gardner gun, and 1 Hotchkiss gun', ' The Maxim machine guns took center stage and decimated the native force at the Battle of the Shangani', ""  Although Lobengula's forces totaled 8,000 spearmen and 2,000 riflemen, versus fewer than 700 soldiers of the British South Africa Police, the Ndebele warriors were not equipped to match the British machine guns"", ' Leander Starr Jameson sent his troops to Bulawayo to try to capture Lobengula, but the king escaped and left Bulawayo in ruins behind him', '  An attempt to bring the king and his forces to submit led to the disaster of the Shangani Patrol when a Ndebele Impi defeated a British South Africa Company patrol led by Major Allan Wilson at the Shangani river in December 1893', ' Except for Frederick Russell Burnham and two other scouts sent for reinforcements, the detachment was surrounded and wiped out', ' This incident had a lasting influence on Matabeleland nationalism and spirit of resistance and the colonists who died in this battle are buried at Matobo Hills along with Jameson and Cecil Rhodes', "" In white Rhodesian history, Wilson's battle takes on the status of General Custer's stand at Little Big Horn in the United States"", ' The Matabele fighters honoured the dead men with a salute to their bravery in battle and reportedly told the king, ""They were men of men and their fathers were men before them', '""  Lobengula died in January 1894, under mysterious circumstances; within a few short months the British South Africa Company controlled Matabeleland, and white settlers continued to arrive', '  Second Matebele War  In March 1896, the Ndebele revolted against the authority of the British South Africa Company in what is now celebrated in Zimbabwe as the First Chimurenga, i', 'e', ', First War of Independence', ' Mlimo, the Ndebele spiritual/religious leader, is credited with fomenting much of the anger that led to this confrontation', ' He convinced the Ndebele that the white settlers (almost 4,000 strong by then) were responsible for the drought, locust plagues and the cattle disease rinderpest ravaging the country at the time', ""  Mlimo's call to battle was well-timed"", "" Only a few months earlier, the British

left the country's security in disarray"", ' In June 1896, the Shona too joined the war, but they stayed mostly on the defensive', ' The British would immediately send troops to suppress the Ndebele

the American scout Frederick Russell Burnham, Cecil Rhodes walked unarmed into the Ndebele stronghold in Matobo Hills and persuaded the impi to lay down their arms, thus bringing the war to a close in

founder of the Scout Movement, and the younger Frederick Russell Burnham, the American born Chief of Scouts for the British Army, first met and began their lifelong friendship', ' Baden-Powell had already, in 1884, published a book called ""Reconnaissance and Scouting""', ' In mid-June 1896, while scouting in the Matobo Hills, Burnham passed on to Baden-Powell aspects of woodcraft he had acquired in America, and it was during this time with Burnham that perhaps the seeds were sown for the program and the code of honour eventually crystallised in Baden-Powell\'s 1899 ""Aids to Scouting for NCOs and Men"" and his later (1908) ""Scouting for Boys"", which was written after his experience of how useful and reliable the boys at Mafeking had been', ' Practiced by frontiersmen of the American Old West and Indigenous peoples of the Americas, woodcraft was generally unknown to the British', ' These skills eventually formed the basis of what is now called scoutcraft, the fundamentals of Scouting', ' Baden-Powell recognised that wars in Africa were changing markedly and the British Army needed to adapt; so during their joint scouting missions, Baden-Powell and Burnham discussed the concept of a broad training programme in woodcraft for young men, rich in exploration, tracking, fieldcraft, and self-reliance', ' It was also during these scouting missions in the Matobo Hills that Baden-Powell first started to wear his signature campaign hat like the one worn by Burnham', ' Later, Baden-Powell wrote a number of books on Scouting, and even started to train and make use of adolescent boys, most famously during the Siege of Mafeking, during the Second Boer War', '  British Rule  British settlement of Rhodesia continued, and by October 1923, the territory of Southern Rhodesia was annexed to the Crown', ' The Ndebele thereby became British subjects and the colony received its first basic constitution and first parliamentary election', "" Ten years later, the British South Africa Company ceded its mineral rights to the territory's government for £2 million"", '  The deep recession of the 1930s gave way to a post-war boom of British immigration', '  After the onset of self-government, a major issue in Southern Rhodesia was the relationship between the white settlers and the Ndebele and Shona populations', ' One major consequence was the white settlers were able to enact discriminatory legislation concerning land tenure', ' The Land Apportionment and Tenure Acts reserved 45% of the land area for exclusively white ownership', ' 25% was designated ""Tribal Trust Land"", which was available to be worked on a collective basis by the already settled farmers and where individual title was not offered', '  In 1965, the white government of Rhodesia, led by Prime Minister Ian Smith, unilaterally declared independence from Britain — only the second state to do so, the other being the United States in 1776', ' Initially, the state proclaimed its loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II as ""Queen of Rhodesia"" (a title to which she never consented), but by 1970 even that link was severed, and Rhodesia claimed to be an independent republic', ' This was not recognised by any other state in the world; legally, Rhodesia remained a British colony', '  Sovereign Rhodesia  The ruling white Rhodesian government did not gain international recognition and faced serious economic problems as a result of sanctions', ' Some states, such as South Africa and Portugal, did support the white minority government of Rhodesia', ' In 1967, the Zimbabwe African People\'s Union began a lengthy armed campaign against Rhodesia\'s white minority government in what became known as the ""Bush War"" by White Rhodesians and as the ""Second Umvukela"" (or rebellion in Ndebele language) by supporters of the rebels', ' The Shona, backed by China, set up a separate war front from neighbouring Mozambique', '  The Rhodesian government agreed to a ceasefire in 1979',

Association of Genocide Scholars estimates that more than 20,000 people were killed and have classified the massacres as a genocide', '  By early 1984, the army disrupted food supplies in Matabeleland and much of the Ndebele population suffered food shortages', ' Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo finally reconciled their political differences by late 1987', "" The roots of discord remained, however, and in some ways increased as Mugabe's rule became increasingly autocratic into the 21st century"", '  In the early 1990s, a Land Acquisition Act was passed, calling for the Mugabe government to purchase mostly white-owned commercial farming land for redistribution to native Africans', ' Matabeleland has rich central plains, watered by tributaries of the Zambezi and Limpopo rivers, allowing it to sustain cattle and consistently produce large amounts of cotton and maize', "" But land grabbing, squatting, and repossessions of large commercial farms under Mugabe's program resulted in a 90%

east of Marondera town', ' It was founded in memory of Bernard Mizeki, an African martyr who died in the Marondera area', ' The school was established by leading private individuals of the Anglican Church in the then Rhodesia through a deed of trust drafted in 1958 and registered on 29 May 1959 at Harare', ' The college was established predominantly for African boys however over the years there were girls who attended the college', '  Foundation The school was founded by a group of prominent individuals of both European and African races and both sexes to be a leading high school for African boys though it had been set up with the view of it becoming a multiracial international school', ',  The founders had seen the winds of change sweeping across Africa and felt they had to provide high quality education, equivalent to what Europeans were receiving, for the future leaders of an independent Rhodesia', ' The whole idea behind the school was to bring up well-rounded African leaders in areas of finance, industry, business, education, medicine, law, military and politics', ' Rt', ' Reverend Cecil Alderson, like his predecessor Bishop Edward Paget,  realised the need for a senior college for Africans had become increasingly urgent, and within a few weeks of his translation from the Bloemfontein Diocese, Bishop Alderson began to investigate ways of meeting it', ' At the same time Canon Robert Grinham had been working to see the existence of schools for Africans whose facilities equaled or approximated to those of Ruzawi, Springvale and Peterhouse', ' To this end he devoted his energies after his retirement from Springvale', '  The Rt Rev Cecil Alderson, then Bishop of Mashonaland and Canon Robert Grinham, raised one hundred British pounds with which they formed the Bernard Mizeki Schools Trust which was then mandated to establish schools', ' The trust deed was prepared at Honey and Blackenberg and registered in 1959 while another trust with the same name was registered in the United Kingdom in July 1962 under trust number 313889', ' A pledge of forty thousand pounds was then made to Bishop Alderson at the Lambeth Conference in London so that the project could be realized', ' A significant chunk of that money is believed to have come from the Beit Trust and then anonymous individuals well wishers banks and corporates', ""  It was intended to be a multiracial, elite boys' school, an 'African Eton', and was strongly supported by the Anglican Church and a number of Federation businesses"", ' With the support of the Governor General of The Federation of Rhodesia funding in the early days was not a challenge  Architectural designs and a master plan of the school were done by John Vigour in 1959', ' The actual construction of the college started in 1960 with the arrival Bruce Berrington, together with some artisans who had built Peterhouse', "" The school was sited amidst brachystegia woodland, a bird-watcher's paradise, and among the baboon and dassie inhabited granite bouldered kopjes that are so typical of Zimbabwe at what is known as the Bovey Tracey Estate"", ' This had been the site of St Bernards School since 1891', '  The school was intended to appeal to the upper African class and charged fees three to four times higher than ordinary mission schools', ' The first head to be appointed, Peter Holmes Canham a civil servant, came from British West Africa (Ghana)', ' Canham was described as a passionate and charismatic figure eccentric with a fiery, if short-lived, temper', ' Canham arrived in September 1960 to take up the headship of the college', ' Upon the commencement of the construction of the College Canon David Neaum left St Bernards Mission for Chikwaka Mission protesting against the construction of the school due to what he considered as the importation of elitism into an Africa crying out for universal education, especially of girls, was iniquitous', '  By the time Father Andrew Hunt retired the enrolment had risen to 320 boys, he relocated to Mutare and became board chair for St Davids Bonda in Mutare', ' Due to the liberation war at that time the expansion of Bernard Mizeki College stalled for a number of years the Ministry was no longer providing funds for the schools expansion', ' After Father Hunt left, the Rev', ' Leslie Davies was appointed to the post of Headmaster of Bernard Mizeki College', ' Unfortunately his term of office did not last long because of the murders of surrounding farmers and a number of priests and nuns at the nearby St', ' Pauls Musami', ' After the incident at Musami, the Rev', ' L', ' Davies was advised by the local police to leave the school as they could not guarantee his safety and that of the students', ' The board of governors immediately appointed Mr', ' Chiadzwa to take over as headmaster of the college avoiding having to completely shutdown the school as other schools like Eagle School in Manicaland which closed in 1976   Governance Bernard Mizeki College is run through the Bernard Mizeki Schools Trust which was founded in 1959 by Canon Robert Grinham and Rt Rev Cecil Alderson', '  Peter Canham, made Bernard Mizeki College such an exceptionally good school', ' As a private school, it was his task, along with the governors, to raise the money to build, staff and ensure the future of the school', ' An ex-colonial civil servant, he ran the place with superb efficiency, leaving the teachers free to get on with their jobs', "" He had strong views on what an 'education' was"", "" In the days when 'blacks' (the other racial groups were 'whites' and 'coloureds') were only allowed into one of Salisbury, the capital's large hotels, he took the prefects to the Ambassador's and made them sit down to a full evening meal - so they could learn the etiquette of 'public' eating"", '  At the time of founding, there were several committees put in place to ensure the establishment of the college was a success', ' At the very top there were the Patrons of the college the three patrons were The Governor-General of Southern Rhodesia The Rt', ' Honourable Earl of Dalhousie, The Governor of Southern Rhodesia Sir

for 4 years and was succeeded by Reverend R', ' Glazebrook', ' The two schools (the college for secondary education, the school for primary) were under the same Board of Governors', ' The schools were heavily aided by the Ministry of African Education of Southern Rhodesia Government', ' Planned expansion was slowed down for a time by the lack of financial Support, but by 1963 the number of pupils reached 180 in the college and 140 in the school', ' Boys who had passed through primary school would automatically qualify to attend the college', ' Under the headmastership of Mr', ' P', ""

"" Canham being a seasoned civil servant from the Gold Coast now Ghana, his career as an administrator in the Gold Coast began in the late 1930s and concluded with the colony's independence as Ghana in 1957"", ' Upon attaining Independence of the Gold Coast Peter Holmes Canham moved to Southern Rhodesia where he took headmastership of Bernard Mizeki College', ' His most notable influence on the college was how he introduced systems of good governance amongst students', "" He introduced a Students Senate where the prefect's body was elected officials from the hostels they resided"", ' Elections and campaigns were held every year to select new senators', ' This led to the college producing an unusually high number of business leaders, lawyers, and politicians', ' According to one former staff member ""It was because of my experiences at the school that I later went into teaching but I never again came across such an inspirational headteacher', ' Later, it was the lack of true leadership skills which made so many of the schools at which I taught for almost 30 years such disappointing places', '"" Due to the same architect and artisans who had built Peterhouse being contracted in the construction of Bernard Mizeki College a few of the buildings between the two schools began to look a lot similar', ' This resulted in a heated argument between F', 'R', ' Snell, first rector of Peterhouse and Peter Canham', ' F', ' R', ' Snell accused Peter Canham of copying building Plans of Peterhouse', ' In 1964 Peter Canham Left Bernard Mizeki College after some disagreements with the Board of Governors and went on to head schools in Uganda, took up principalships of teacher training colleges in Western and Northern Nigeria, and finally to teaching Third World Studies in the Institutes of Education at the Universities of London and Cardiff', ' He retired from Cardiff in June 1981, but his retirement was soon clouded by ill-health, and he died in October 1984', '  Motto and school badge The college\'s motto is in  and means ""I have liberated my mind""', '  The school badge was designed by a Mr Watambwa who was one of the artisans involved in

among parents and the former students who demanded the school to improve its performance in public examinations', '  Recent Challenges In November 2015 the cabinet adopted a civil services report which recommended the withdrawal of funding for teacher salaries employed at private schools due to the current Economic meltdown in Zimbabwe', ' The government grant was used to pay salaries for seventeen teachers stationed at Bernard Mizeki College', ' The government argued that teachers at private schools alone gobbled about $70 million United States dollars in salaries and allowances', '

survivors on the ground"", ' The majority of Rhodesians, both black and white, saw the attack as an act of terrorism', ' A fierce Rhodesian backlash followed against enemy strongholds and increased racial tension even though few black Rhodesians supported attacks of this kind', "" Reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as Time magazine, but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments, much to the Rhodesian government's indignation"", '  Talks between Nkomo and Prime Minister Ian Smith, which had been progressing promisingly, were immediately suspended by the Rhodesians, with Smith calling Nkomo a ""monster""', ' On 10 September, Smith announced the extension of martial law over selected areas', ' The Rhodesian Security Forces launched several retaliatory strikes into Zambia and Mozambique over the following months, attacking both ZIPRA and its rival, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA)', ' The attack on ZIPRA in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were refugees camping in and around guerrilla positions', ' In February 1979, ZIPRA shot down Air Rhodesia Flight 827, another civilian flight, in an almost identical incident', '  Background [[File:Zimbabwe in Africa', 'svg|thumb|upright|Rhodesia]] A dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty to the self-governing colony of Rhodesia led the colonial government, headed by Prime Minister Ian Smith, to unilaterally declare independence from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965', ' The idea of ""no independence before majority rule"" had recently gained ground in Britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation, and Rhodesia\'s government was dominated by the country\'s white minority, so the unilateral declaration went unrecognised internationally', ' Britain and the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia', ""  Two rival communist-backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule: the Chinese-aligned Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), mostly comprising Shonas, created the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and adopted aspects of Maoist doctrine, while the Ndebele-dominated Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), aligned with Soviet-style Marxism–Leninism and the Warsaw Pact, mobilised the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA)"", ';   These guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the ""Second Chimurenga"" against the Rhodesian government and security forces', ' The resulting conflict, the Rhodesian Bush War, began in earnest in December 1972, when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms in north-eastern Rhodesia', ""  After the security forces mounted a successful counter-insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974, developments overseas caused the conflict's momentum to shift in the insurgents' favour"", "" The leftist Carnation Revolution of April 1974 caused Portugal to withdraw its key economic support for Smith's administration, and led to Mozambique's independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with ZANU"", "" Around the same time, Rhodesia's other main backer, South Africa, adopted a détente initiative that forced a ceasefire, giving the guerrillas time to regroup"", ' Following the abortive Victoria Falls Conference of August 1975, Smith and the ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo held unsuccessful talks between December 1975 and March 1976', ' ZANU and ZAPU announced in October 1976, during the run-up to the unsuccessful Geneva Conference in December, that they would henceforth attend conferences as a joint ""Patriotic Front""', '  In March 1978, Smith and non-militant nationalist groups headed by Bishop Abel Muzorewa, the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole and Chief Jeremiah Chirau agreed what became the ""Internal Settlement""', ' This created a joint black–white transitional government, with the country due to be reconstituted as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, pursuant to multiracial elections', ' ZANU and ZAPU were invited to participate, but refused; Nkomo sardonically dubbed Smith\'s black colleagues ""the blacksmiths""', ' ZANU proclaimed 1978 to be ""The Year of the People"" as the war continued', "" Officials from Muzorewa's United African National Council, sent to the provinces to explain the Internal Settlement to rural blacks, were killed by Marxist–Leninist guerrillas"", ' Insurgents also began to target Christian missionaries, climaxing in the killing of nine British missionaries and four children at Elim Mission near the Mozambican border in the Vumba massacre on 23 June', '  The transitional government was badly received abroad, partly because the Internal Settlement kept control of law enforcement, the military, the judiciary and the civil service under white control', "" No country recognised Rhodesia's interim administration"", ' Smith again worked to bring Nkomo into the government, hoping this would lend it some credence domestically, prompt diplomatic recognition overseas, and help the security forces defeat ZANLA', ' Starting on 14 August 1978, he attended secret meetings with Nkomo in Lusaka, Zambia (where ZAPU was based), doing so with the assistance of the mining corporation Lonrho', ' Attempts were made to also involve the ZANU leader Robert Mugabe, but Mugabe would have no part in the talks', ' According to the South African military historian Jakkie Cilliers, negotiations between Smith and Nkomo progressed well and

Salisbury, returning home after a weekend at the lake', ' The flight took off from Kariba Airport on schedule soon after 17:00 Central Africa Time', '  Flight 825 was piloted by 36-year-old Captain

plane's starboard wing and exploded, causing the inner engine to also explode"", ' A fuel tank and hydraulic lines ruptured, creating a fire that could not be put out', ' The second starboard engine failed almost immediately, leaving Hood with only his two port engines', ' Heaving wildly, the Hunyani began to descend rapidly', '  At 17:10 Captain Hood sent a distress call to air traffic control, informing them that he had lost the two starboard engines and was going to crash', ' ""We\'re going in,"" he radioed', ' Telling his passengers to brace for an emergency landing, he aimed for an open field of cotton in the Whamira Hills, in the bush to the west of Karoi, intending to belly land the craft', ' The landing was relatively stable until the Hunyani hit a ditch, cartwheeled and exploded', ' The remaining fuel tanks ruptured and caught fire, setting the wrecked cabin ablaze', '  Massacre on the ground Of the 56 people on board, 38, including Hood and Beaumont, died in the

nine guerrillas made their way towards the crash site, and reached it at about 17:45', ' Three of the 13 survivors remaining at the crash site hid on seeing figures approaching: Rhodesian Army reservist Anthony Hill, 39, took cover in the surrounding bush, while businessman Hans Hansen and his wife Diana did the same', ' This left 10 passengers in full view near the wreckage, including four women and two girls (aged 11 and 4)', '  The guerrillas, who were armed with AK-47 rifles, presented themselves to the 10 passengers as friendly, saying they would summon help and bring water', ' They spoke in English, both to the survivors and among themselves', ' They told the passengers to congregate around a point a few metres from the wreckage; when the survivors said that some of them were too badly injured to walk, the insurgents told the able-bodied men to carry the others', ' The passengers were assembled into an area of about ', ' Standing roughly  away, the cadres now raised their weapons', ' ""You have taken our land,"" one of them said', ' ""Please don\'t shoot us!"" one of the passengers cried, just before they were killed by a sustained burst of automatic gunfire', '  Those that survived the initial bursts were bayoneted (including a mother and her 3-week-old baby)', '  Having collected water from the nearby village, MacLaren and his companions were almost back at the crash site when they heard the shots', ' Thinking it was personal ammunition in the luggage exploding in the heat, they continued on their way, and called out to the other passengers, who they thought were still alive', ' This alerted the insurgents to the presence of more survivors; one of the guerrillas told MacLaren\'s group to ""come here""', ' The insurgents then opened fire on their general location, prompting MacLaren and the others to flee', ' Hill and the Hansens also ran; they revealed their positions to the fighters in their haste, but successfully hid themselves behind a ridge', '

that responsibility for the massacre lay with security force pseudo-guerrillas, more specifically the Selous Scouts unit, which had often been accused of brutalising rural civilians with the goal of shifting public opinion', ' Sibanda asserts that the massacre ""cannot be put beyond"" the Scouts, and also supports Nkomo\'s claim that the Hunyani had been used militarily, suggesting that ZIPRA

survivors on the ground"", ' The majority of Rhodesians, both black and white, saw the attack as an act of terrorism', ' A fierce Rhodesian backlash followed against enemy strongholds and increased racial tension even though few black Rhodesians supported attacks of this kind', "" Reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as Time magazine, but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments, much to the Rhodesian government's indignation"", '  Talks between Nkomo and Prime Minister Ian Smith, which had been progressing promisingly, were immediately suspended by the Rhodesians, with Smith calling Nkomo a ""monster""', ' On 10 September, Smith announced the extension of martial law over selected areas', ' The Rhodesian Security Forces launched several retaliatory strikes into Zambia and Mozambique over the following months, attacking both ZIPRA and its rival, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA)', ' The attack on

independence before majority rule"" had recently gained ground in Britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation, and Rhodesia\'s government was dominated by the country\'s white minority, so the unilateral declaration went unrecognised internationally', ' Britain and the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia', ""  Two rival communist-backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule: the Chinese-aligned Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), mostly comprising Shonas, created the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and adopted aspects of Maoist doctrine, while the Ndebele-dominated Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), aligned with Soviet-style Marxism–Leninism and the Warsaw Pact, mobilised the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA)"", ';   These guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the ""Second Chimurenga"" against the Rhodesian government and security forces', ' The resulting conflict, the Rhodesian Bush War, began in earnest in December 1972, when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms in north-eastern Rhodesia', ""  After the security forces mounted a successful counter-insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974, developments overseas caused the conflict's momentum to shift in the insurgents' favour"", "" The leftist Carnation Revolution of April 1974 caused Portugal to withdraw its key economic support for Smith's administration, and led to Mozambique's independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with ZANU"", "" Around the same time, Rhodesia's other main backer, South Africa, adopted a détente initiative that forced a ceasefire, giving the guerrillas time to regroup"", ' Following the abortive Victoria Falls Conference of August 1975, Smith and the ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo held unsuccessful talks between December 1975 and March 1976', ' ZANU and ZAPU announced in October 1976, during the run-up to the unsuccessful Geneva Conference in December, that they would henceforth attend conferences as a joint ""Patriotic Front""', '  In March 1978, Smith and non-militant nationalist groups headed by Bishop Abel Muzorewa, the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole and Chief Jeremiah Chirau agreed what became the ""Internal Settlement""', ' This created a joint black–white transitional government, with the country due to be reconstituted as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, pursuant to multiracial elections', ' ZANU and ZAPU were invited to participate, but refused; Nkomo sardonically dubbed Smith\'s black colleagues ""the blacksmiths""', ' ZANU proclaimed 1978 to be ""The Year of the People"" as the war continued', "" Officials from Muzorewa's United African National Council, sent to the provinces to explain the Internal Settlement to rural blacks, were killed by Marxist–Leninist guerrillas"", ' Insurgents also began to target Christian missionaries, climaxing in the killing of nine British missionaries and four children at Elim Mission near the Mozambican border in the Vumba massacre on 23 June', '  The transitional government was badly received abroad, partly because the Internal Settlement kept control of law enforcement, the military, the judiciary and the civil service under white control', "" No country recognised Rhodesia's interim administration"", ' Smith again worked to bring Nkomo into the government, hoping this would lend it some credence domestically, prompt diplomatic recognition overseas, and help the security forces defeat ZANLA', ' Starting on 14 August 1978, he attended secret meetings with Nkomo in Lusaka, Zambia (where ZAPU was based), doing so with the assistance of the mining corporation Lonrho', ' Attempts were made to also involve the ZANU leader Robert Mugabe, but Mugabe would have no part in the talks', ' According to the South African military historian Jakkie Cilliers, negotiations between Smith and Nkomo progressed well and

reservist Anthony Hill, 39, took cover in the surrounding bush, while businessman Hans Hansen and his wife Diana did the same', ' This left 10 passengers in full view near the wreckage, including four women and two girls (aged 11 and 4)', '  The guerrillas, who were armed with AK-47 rifles, presented themselves to the 10 passengers as friendly, saying they would summon help and bring water', ' They spoke in English, both to the survivors and among themselves', ' They told the passengers to congregate around a point a few metres from the wreckage; when the survivors said that some of them were too badly injured to walk, the insurgents told the able-bodied men to carry the others', ' The passengers were assembled into an area of about ', ' Standing roughly  away, the cadres now raised their weapons', ' ""You have taken our land,"" one of them said', ' ""Please don\'t shoot us!"" one of the passengers cried, just before they were killed by a sustained burst of automatic gunfire', '  Those that survived the initial bursts were bayoneted (including a mother and her 3-week-old baby)', '  Having collected water from the nearby village, MacLaren and his companions were almost back at the

through treaties such as the Rudd Concession and the Moffat Treaty, which was signed by King Lobengula of the Ndebele people', ' ""Southern"" was first used in 1898 and dropped from normal usage in 1964, on the break-up of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland', ' ""Rhodesia"" then remained the name of the country until the creation of Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979', ' Legally, from the British

(BSAC), would administer the territory stretching from the Limpopo to Lake Tanganyika under charter as a protectorate"", ' Queen Victoria signed the charter in 1889', ' Rhodes used this document in 1890 to justify sending the Pioneer Column, a group of white settlers protected by well-armed British South Africa Police (BSAP) and guided by the big game hunter Frederick Selous, through Matabeleland and into Shona territory to establish Fort Salisbury (now Harare)', ' In 1893–1894, with the help of their new Maxim guns, the BSAP defeated the Ndebele in the First Matabele War, a war which also resulted in the death of King Lobengula and the death of most of the members of the Shangani Patrol', ' Shortly after the disastrous BSAP Jameson Raid into the Transvaal Republic, the Ndebele were led by their spiritual leader Mlimo against the white colonials and thus began the Second Matabele War (1896–97) which resulted in the extermination of nearly half the British settlers', ' After months of bloodshed, Mlimo was found and shot by the American scout Frederick Russell Burnham and soon thereafter Rhodes walked unarmed into the Ndebele stronghold in Matobo Hills and persuaded the impi to lay down their arms, effectively ending the revolt', ""  A legislative council was created in 1899 to manage the company's civil affairs, with a minority of elected seats, through which the BSAC had to pass government measures"", ' As the company was a British institution in which settlers and capitalists owned most shares, and local black African tribal chiefs the remainder, and the electorate to this council was limited to those shareholders, the electorate was almost exclusively white settlers', ' Over time as more settlers arrived and a growing number had less than the amount of land required to own a share in the company or where in trades supporting the company as workers, successive activism resulted in first increasing the proportion of elected seats, and eventually allowing non-share holders the right to vote in the election', ' Prior to about 1918, the opinion among the electorate supported continued BSAC rule but opinion changed because of the development of the country and increased settlement', ' In addition, a decision in the British courts that land not in private ownership belonged to the British Crown rather than the BSAC gave great impetus to the campaign for self-government', ' In the resulting treaty government self-government, Crown lands which were sold to settlers allowed those settlers the right to vote in the self-governing colony', '  Century up to independence  The territory north of the Zambezi was the subject of separate treaties with African chiefs: today, it forms the country of Zambia', ' The first

for expanding the self-government of the Rhodesian people which saw BSAC rule as an impediment to further expansion', '  The Southern Rhodesian Legislative Council election of 1920 returned a large majority of candidates of the Responsible Government Association and it became clear that BSAC rule was no longer practical', ' Opinion in the United Kingdom and South Africa favoured incorporation of

settler population', ' The CAF sought to emulate the experience of Australia, Canada and South Africa – wherein groups of colonies had been federated together to form viable independent nations', ' Originally designed to be ""an indissoluble federation"", the CAF quickly started to unravel due to the low proportion of British and other white citizens in relation to the larger black populations', ' Additionally, by incorporating the tribes within the Federation as potential citizens, the Federation created the paradoxical situation of having a white elite owning most of the land and capital, whilst using cheap black labour', '  The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was dissolved on 1 January 1964', ' However, it was expected that only Nyasaland would be let go, whilst the remainder of Rhodesia both north and south would be united', ' Although Northern Rhodesia had a white population of over 100,000, as well as additional British military and civil units and their dependents, most of these were relatively new to the region, were primarily in the extraction business, had little landed interests, and were more amenable to allowing black nationalism than the Southern Rhodesians', ' Accordingly, Britain granted independence to Northern Rhodesia on 24 October 1964', ' However, when the new nationalists changed its name to Zambia and began tentatively at first and later in rapid march an Africanisation campaign, Southern Rhodesia remained a British colony, resisting attempts to bring in majority rule', ' The colony attempted to change its name to Rhodesia although this was

the three member states (due to its vast copper mines) and had contributed more to the overall building of infrastructure than the other two members did', ' Southern Rhodesia, recognising an inevitable dissolution of the Federation, was quick to use federal funds in building its infrastructure ahead of the others', ' A key component of this was the building of the Kariba Dam and its hydroelectric facility (shafts, control centre, etc', '), which was situated on the Southern Rhodesian side of the Zambezi Gorge', ' This situation caused some embarrassment for the Zambian government later when it was a ""front line state"" in support of insurgents into Rhodesia in that its major source of electric power was controlled by the Rhodesian state', '  Return to ""Rhodesia""  With the

survivors on the ground"", ' The majority of Rhodesians, both black and white, saw the attack as an act of terrorism', ' A fierce Rhodesian backlash followed against enemy strongholds and increased racial tension even though few black Rhodesians supported attacks of this kind', "" Reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as Time magazine, but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments, much to the Rhodesian government's indignation"", '  Talks between Nkomo and Prime Minister Ian Smith, which had been progressing promisingly, were immediately suspended by the Rhodesians, with Smith calling Nkomo a ""monster""', ' On 10 September, Smith announced the extension of martial law over selected areas', ' The Rhodesian Security Forces launched several retaliatory strikes into Zambia and Mozambique over the following months, attacking both ZIPRA and its rival, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA)', ' The attack on

independence before majority rule"" had recently gained ground in Britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation, and Rhodesia\'s government was dominated by the country\'s white minority, so the unilateral declaration went unrecognised internationally', ' Britain and the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia', ""  Two rival communist-backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule: the Chinese-aligned Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), mostly comprising Shonas, created the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and adopted aspects of Maoist doctrine, while the Ndebele-dominated Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), aligned with Soviet-style Marxism–Leninism and the Warsaw Pact, mobilised the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA)"", ';   These guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the ""Second Chimurenga"" against the Rhodesian government and security forces', ' The resulting conflict, the Rhodesian Bush War, began in earnest in December 1972, when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms in north-eastern Rhodesia', ""  After the security forces mounted a successful counter-insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974, developments overseas caused the conflict's momentum to shift in the insurgents' favour"", "" The leftist Carnation Revolution of April 1974 caused Portugal to withdraw its key economic support for Smith's administration, and led to Mozambique's independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with ZANU"", "" Around the same time, Rhodesia's other main backer, South Africa, adopted a détente initiative that forced a ceasefire, giving the guerrillas time to regroup"", ' Following the abortive Victoria Falls Conference of August 1975, Smith and the ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo held unsuccessful talks between December 1975 and March 1976', ' ZANU and ZAPU announced in October 1976, during the run-up to the unsuccessful Geneva Conference in December, that they would henceforth attend conferences as a joint ""Patriotic Front""', '  In March 1978, Smith and non-militant nationalist groups headed by Bishop Abel Muzorewa, the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole and Chief Jeremiah Chirau agreed what became the ""Internal Settlement""', ' This created a joint black–white transitional government, with the country due to be reconstituted as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, pursuant to multiracial elections', ' ZANU and ZAPU were invited to participate, but refused; Nkomo sardonically dubbed Smith\'s black colleagues ""the blacksmiths""', ' ZANU proclaimed 1978 to be ""The Year of the People"" as the war continued', "" Officials from Muzorewa's United African National Council, sent to the provinces to explain the Internal Settlement to rural blacks, were killed by Marxist–Leninist guerrillas"", ' Insurgents also began to target Christian missionaries, climaxing in the killing of nine British missionaries and four children at Elim Mission near the Mozambican border in the Vumba massacre on 23 June', '  The transitional government was badly received abroad, partly because the Internal Settlement kept control of law enforcement, the military, the judiciary and the civil service under white control', "" No country recognised Rhodesia's interim administration"", ' Smith again worked to bring Nkomo into the government, hoping this would lend it some credence domestically, prompt diplomatic recognition overseas, and help the security forces defeat ZANLA', ' Starting on 14 August 1978, he attended secret meetings with Nkomo in Lusaka, Zambia (where ZAPU was based), doing so with the assistance of the mining corporation Lonrho', ' Attempts were made to also involve the ZANU leader Robert Mugabe, but Mugabe would have no part in the talks', ' According to the South African military historian Jakkie Cilliers, negotiations between Smith and Nkomo progressed well and

reservist Anthony Hill, 39, took cover in the surrounding bush, while businessman Hans Hansen and his wife Diana did the same', ' This left 10 passengers in full view near the wreckage, including four women and two girls (aged 11 and 4)', '  The guerrillas, who were armed with AK-47 rifles, presented themselves to the 10 passengers as friendly, saying they would summon help and bring water', ' They spoke in English, both to the survivors and among themselves', ' They told the passengers to congregate around a point a few metres from the wreckage; when the survivors said that some of them were too badly injured to walk, the insurgents told the able-bodied men to carry the others', ' The passengers were assembled into an area of about ', ' Standing roughly  away, the cadres now raised their weapons', ' ""You have taken our land,"" one of them said', ' ""Please don\'t shoot us!"" one of the passengers cried, just before they were killed by a sustained burst of automatic gunfire', '  Those that survived the initial bursts were bayoneted (including a mother and her 3-week-old baby)', '  Having collected water from the nearby village, MacLaren and his companions were almost back at the

the resort town of Kariba', "" Despite the occasional rocket and mortar attacks launched on Kariba by ZIPRA guerrillas on the northern side of the Zambezi (in Zambia), the resort had endured as one of Rhodesia's choice tourist destinations"", ' The flight on 3 September 1978, Sunday afternoon, from Kariba to Salisbury carried four crew members and 52 passengers, most of whom were holidaymakers from Salisbury, returning home after a weekend at the lake', ' The flight took off from Kariba Airport on schedule soon after 17:00 Central Africa Time', '  Flight 825 was piloted by 36-year-old Captain

plane's starboard wing and exploded, causing the inner engine to also explode"", ' A fuel tank and hydraulic lines ruptured, creating a fire that could not be put out', ' The second starboard engine failed almost immediately, leaving Hood with only his two port engines', ' Heaving wildly, the Hunyani began to descend rapidly', '  At 17:10 Captain Hood sent a distress call to air traffic control, informing them that he had lost the two starboard engines and was going to crash', ' ""We\'re going in,"" he radioed', ' Telling his passengers to brace for an emergency landing, he aimed for an open

nine guerrillas made their way towards the crash site, and reached it at about 17:45', ' Three of the 13 survivors remaining at the crash site hid on seeing figures approaching: Rhodesian Army reservist Anthony Hill, 39, took cover in the surrounding bush, while businessman Hans Hansen and his wife Diana did the same', ' This left 10 passengers in full view near the wreckage, including four women and two girls (aged 11 and 4)', '  The guerrillas, who were armed with AK-47 rifles, presented themselves to the 10 passengers as friendly, saying they would summon help and bring water', ' They spoke in English, both to the survivors and among themselves', ' They told the passengers to congregate around a point a few metres from the wreckage; when the survivors said that some of them were too badly injured to walk, the insurgents told the able-bodied men to carry the others', ' The passengers were assembled into an area of about ', ' Standing roughly  away, the cadres now raised their weapons', ' ""You have taken our land,"" one of them said', ' ""Please don\'t shoot us!"" one of the passengers cried, just before they were killed by a sustained burst of automatic gunfire', '  Those that survived the initial bursts were bayoneted (including a mother and her 3-week-old baby)', '  Having collected water from the nearby village, MacLaren and his companions were almost back at the crash site when they heard the shots', ' Thinking it was personal ammunition in the luggage exploding in the heat, they continued on their way, and called out to the other passengers, who they thought were still alive', ' This alerted the insurgents to the presence of more survivors; one of the guerrillas told MacLaren\'s group to ""come here""', ' The insurgents then opened fire on their general location, prompting MacLaren and the others to flee', ' Hill and the Hansens also ran; they revealed their positions to the fighters in their haste, but successfully hid themselves behind a ridge', ' After Hill and the others had hidden there for about two hours, they saw the attackers return to the crash site at about 19:45', "" The guerrillas looted the wrecked cabin and some of the suitcases strewn around the site, filled their arms with passengers' belongings, then left again"", '  The survivors were found over the following days by the Rhodesian Army and police; Hill and the Hansens were taken to Kariba Hospital, while MacLaren and his group were airlifted to Andrew Fleming Hospital in Salisbury', ""  Nkomo claims responsibility, but denies killing survivors Nkomo claimed

wicked massacre shocked the entire nation and the world', ' Black and white united in condemnation of the shooting down of Flight 825 and the senseless loss of innocent lives', ' Reports that ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo had laughed about the incident when interviewed on television by the BBC were met with utter revulsion', '"" He said that he had received intelligence that the Hunyani was being used for military purposes', "" Nkomo said he regretted the deaths as it was not his party's policy to kill civilians, and denied that his men had killed any survivors on the ground; by contrast, he said that his men had helped them, and had left them alive"", ' He also accused Air Rhodesia of surreptitiously hauling troops and war materiel for the government, an allegation that Captain Pat Travers, Air Rhodesia\'s general manager, called a ""downright, deliberate lie""', '  According to Eliakim Sibanda, a professor and human rights speaker who wrote a history of ZAPU, Nkomo was implying that responsibility for the massacre lay with security force pseudo-guerrillas, more specifically the Selous Scouts unit, which had often been accused of brutalising rural civilians with the goal of shifting public opinion', ' Sibanda asserts that the massacre ""cannot be put beyond"" the Scouts, and also supports Nkomo\'s claim that the Hunyani had been used militarily, suggesting that ZIPRA might have believed there to be Rhodesian soldiers on board', ' ""Rhodesian television, before attacks on ZANLA in Mozambique, had shown Viscounts ferrying paratroopers for the job,"" he writes, ""',

was common knowledge in Salisbury within hours"", ' Smith wrote in his memoirs that the ""degree of anger\xa0', '', '', ' [was] difficult to control""', ' White South Africans were similarly enraged, particularly after reports appeared in the South African press that the killers had raped the female passengers before massacring them', ' A Friends of Rhodesia Society in South Africa offered a reward of R100,000 to anybody who would either kill Nkomo or bring him to Salisbury to stand trial', '  Geoffrey Nyarota, who was then one of the few black reporters at the Rhodesia Herald newspaper, later wrote in his memoirs that many whites became resentful and wary towards blacks in general, believing them all to be ""terrorist sympathisers""', ' Describing the Herald newsroom the night of the incident, he relates a ""vile collective temper"" among the white sub-editors: ""They cursed until their voices became hoarse, threatening dire consequences for all ""terrs"" and ""munts"" or ""kaffirs""', '', '', '\xa0I sensed that some of the more derogatory remarks made in unnecessarily loud voices that evening were meant specifically for my ears', '"", stress in original  Several racially motivated incidents occurred over the following days', ' According to the Time article, a group of whites entered an unsegregated Salisbury bar ""fingering the triggers of rifles"" and forced blacks drinking there to leave', ' Time also reported a rumour that two white youths, on learning of the massacre, shot the first black man they saw', ' Smith says that several would-be vigilante groups sought his permission to venture into the bush around the crash site to ""make the local people pay for their crime of harbouring and assisting the terrorists""', ' He instructed them not to, according to his memoirs, telling them that many rural blacks only assisted the guerrillas under extreme duress, and that it would not do to attack them', ' Many Rhodesians also resented the apparent

thousand years ago', ' They produced rock paintings at Lapalala within the Waterberg, including depictions of rhinoceros and antelope', ' Early Iron Age settlers in Waterberg were Bantu, who had brought cattle to the region', ' The Bantu created a problem in Waterberg, since cattle reduced grassland caused invasion of brush species leading to an outbreak of the tse-tse fly', ' The ensuing

ZW-2005-5#-00000733,"['Bernard Mizeki College is an independent boarding school for boys situated in Marondera, Zimbabwe approximately 87\xa0km east of the capital Harare and or 13', '5\xa0km north east of Marondera town', ' It was founded in memory of Bernard Mizeki, an African martyr who died in the Marondera area', ' The school was established by leading private individuals of the Anglican Church in the then Rhodesia through a deed of trust drafted in 1958 and registered on 29 May 1959 at Harare', ' The college was established predominantly for African boys however over the years there were girls who attended the college', '  Foundation The school was founded by a group of prominent individuals of both European and African races and both sexes to be a leading high school for African boys though it had been set up with the view of it becoming a multiracial international school', ',  The founders had seen the winds of change sweeping across Africa and felt they had to provide high quality education, equivalent to what Europeans were receiving, for the future leaders of an independent Rhodesia', ' The whole idea behind the school was to bring up well-rounded African leaders in areas of finance, industry, business, education, medicine, law, military and politics', ' Rt', ' Reverend Cecil Alderson, like his predecessor Bishop Edward Paget,  realised the need for a senior college for Africans had become increasingly urgent, and within a few weeks of his translation from the Bloemfontein Diocese, Bishop Alderson began to investigate ways of meeting it', ' At the same time Canon Robert Grinham had been working to see the existence of schools for Africans whose facilities equaled or approximated to those of Ruzawi, Springvale and Peterhouse', ' To this end he devoted his energies after his retirement from Springvale', '  The Rt Rev Cecil Alderson, then Bishop of Mashonaland and Canon Robert Grinham, raised one hundred British pounds with which they formed the Bernard Mizeki Schools Trust which was then mandated to establish schools', ' The trust deed was prepared at Honey and Blackenberg and registered in 1959 while another trust with the same name was registered in the United Kingdom in July 1962 under trust number 313889', ' A pledge of forty thousand pounds was then made to Bishop Alderson at the Lambeth Conference in London so that the project could be realized', ' A significant chunk of that money is believed to have come from the Beit Trust and then anonymous individuals well wishers banks and corporates', ""  It was intended to be a multiracial, elite boys' school, an 'African Eton', and was strongly supported by the Anglican Church and a number of Federation businesses"", ' With the support of the Governor General of The Federation of Rhodesia funding in the early days was not a challenge  Architectural designs and a master plan of the school were done by John Vigour in 1959', ' The actual construction of the college started in 1960 with the arrival Bruce Berrington, together with some artisans who had built Peterhouse', "" The school was sited amidst brachystegia woodland, a bird-watcher's paradise, and among the baboon and dassie inhabited granite bouldered kopjes that are so typical of Zimbabwe at what is known as the Bovey Tracey Estate"", ' This had been the site of St Bernards School since 1891', '  The school was intended to appeal to the upper African class and charged fees three to four times higher than ordinary mission schools', ' The first head to be appointed, Peter Holmes Canham a civil servant, came from British West Africa (Ghana)', ' Canham was described as a passionate and charismatic figure eccentric with a fiery, if short-lived, temper', ' Canham arrived in September 1960 to take up the headship of the college', ' Upon the commencement of the construction of the College Canon David Neaum left St Bernards Mission for Chikwaka Mission protesting against the construction of the school due to what he considered as the importation of elitism into an Africa crying out for universal education, especially of girls, was iniquitous', '  By the time Father Andrew Hunt retired the enrolment had risen to 320 boys, he relocated to Mutare and became board chair for St Davids Bonda in Mutare', ' Due to the liberation war at that time the expansion of Bernard Mizeki College stalled for a number of years the Ministry was no longer providing funds for the schools expansion', ' After Father Hunt left, the Rev', ' Leslie Davies was appointed to the post of Headmaster of Bernard Mizeki College', ' Unfortunately his term of office did not last long because of the murders of surrounding farmers and a number of priests and nuns at the nearby St', ' Pauls Musami', ' After the incident at Musami, the Rev', ' L', ' Davies was advised by the local police to leave the school as they could not guarantee his safety and that of the students', ' The board of governors immediately appointed Mr', ' Chiadzwa to take over as headmaster of the college avoiding having to completely shutdown the school as other schools like Eagle School in Manicaland which closed in 1976   Governance Bernard Mizeki College is run through the Bernard Mizeki Schools Trust which was founded in 1959 by Canon Robert Grinham and Rt Rev Cecil Alderson', '  Peter Canham, made Bernard Mizeki College such an exceptionally good school', ' As a private school, it was his task, along with the governors, to raise the money to build, staff and ensure the future of the school', ' An ex-colonial civil servant, he ran the place with superb efficiency, leaving the teachers free to get on with their jobs', "" He had strong views on what an 'education' was"", "" In the days when 'blacks' (the other racial groups were 'whites' and 'coloureds') were only allowed into one of Salisbury, the capital's large hotels, he took the prefects to the Ambassador's and made them sit down to a full evening meal - so they could learn the etiquette of 'public' eating"", '  At the time of founding, there were several committees put in place to ensure the establishment of the college was a success', ' At the very top there were the Patrons of the college the three patrons were The Governor-General of Southern Rhodesia The Rt', ' Honourable Earl of Dalhousie, The Governor of Southern Rhodesia Sir Humphrey Gibbs and Sir Ellis Robins', '  the College Trustees was made up of leading lawyers, business persons, and senior civil servants', ' one of the trustees was Robert stumbles of Stumbles and Row Law Firm', '  The Board of Governors consisted of notable business person lawyers and civil servants like Herbert W', ' Chitepo, Robert Tredgold', '  Association of Trust Schools On 19 October 1962 Bernard Mizeki College became a founding member of the Association of Trust Schools (ATS) represented by Mr G', 'C', 'V', ' Coppen at the inaugural meeting which also saw the formation of the Conference of Independent Schools Heads (CHISZ)', ' As of July 2016 the college is not a member of the CHISZ ATS, however negotiations are underway to rejoin', ""Conference of Heads of Independent Schools of Zimbabwe(CHISZ), Association of Trust Schools(ATS)  The college is currently a member of the International Boys' Schools Coalition (IBSC)"", '  The College and the Primary School  The college was under the headmastership of Peter Holmes Canham, whilst the Bernard Mizeki Primary School was under the headmastership of Mr', ' G', 'F', ' Coney', ' Canham headed Bernard Mizeki College for 4 years and was succeeded by Reverend R', ' Glazebrook', ' The two schools (the college for secondary education, the school for primary) were under the same Board of Governors', ' The schools were heavily aided by the Ministry of African Education of Southern Rhodesia Government', ' Planned expansion was slowed down for a time by the lack of financial Support, but by 1963 the number of pupils reached 180 in the college and 140 in the school', ' Boys who had passed through primary school would automatically qualify to attend the college', ' Under the headmastership of Mr', ' P', "" Nheweyembwa the college has embarked on a number of developmental projects thus the college was awarded the Secretary's Bell Merit Award for Best School in Mashonaland East for 2014"", '  Mr Peter H', "" Canham being a seasoned civil servant from the Gold Coast now Ghana, his career as an administrator in the Gold Coast began in the late 1930s and concluded with the colony's independence as Ghana in 1957"", ' Upon attaining Independence of the Gold Coast Peter Holmes Canham moved to Southern Rhodesia where he took headmastership of Bernard Mizeki College', ' His most notable influence on the college was how he introduced systems of good governance amongst students', "" He introduced a Students Senate where the prefect's body was elected officials from the hostels they resided"", ' Elections and campaigns were held every year to select new senators', ' This led to the college producing an unusually high number of business leaders, lawyers, and politicians', ' According to one former staff member ""It was because of my experiences at the school that I later went into teaching but I never again came across such an inspirational headteacher', ' Later, it was the lack of true leadership skills which made so many of the schools at which I taught for almost 30 years such disappointing places', '"" Due to the same architect and artisans who had built Peterhouse being contracted in the construction of Bernard Mizeki College a few of the buildings between the two schools began to look a lot similar', ' This resulted in a heated argument between F', 'R', ' Snell, first rector of Peterhouse and Peter Canham', ' F', ' R', ' Snell accused Peter Canham of copying building Plans of Peterhouse', ' In 1964 Peter Canham Left Bernard Mizeki College after some disagreements with the Board of Governors and went on to head schools in Uganda, took up principalships of teacher training colleges in Western and Northern Nigeria, and finally to teaching Third World Studies in the Institutes of Education at the Universities of London and Cardiff', ' He retired from Cardiff in June 1981, but his retirement was soon clouded by ill-health, and he died in October 1984', '  Motto and school badge The college\'s motto is in  and means ""I have liberated my mind""', '  The school badge was designed by a Mr Watambwa who was one of the artisans involved in the construction of the college in 1960', ' The badge depicts a shield with a cross on it with two spears running down across at slanted angle', "" A martyr's crown sits atop the cross"", "" The college's motto is printed on a ribbon below the shield"", '  Academic The college aims to provide an academic curriculum that provides pupils with a broad-based educational experience', ' Introduction of more specialised subjects has taken place in the last few years the options available enable pupils to take a combination of academic or commercial or practical subjects', ' In the 2014 academic year Bernard Mizeki College was ranked 53rd nationally and 7th in Mashonaland East Province attaining a pass rate of 96', '97% with a candidature of 33 boys for Advanced Level studies', ' In the same year the college attained an 86', '11% pass rate with 71 boys having sat for the ZIMSEC Ordinary Level examinations and was ranked 29th nationally', ' These results sparked an outcry among parents and the former students who demanded the school to improve its performance in public examinations', '  Recent Challenges In November 2015 the cabinet adopted a civil services report which recommended the withdrawal of funding for teacher salaries employed at private schools due to the current Economic meltdown in Zimbabwe', ' The government grant was used to pay salaries for seventeen teachers stationed at Bernard Mizeki College', ' The government argued that teachers at private schools alone gobbled about $70 million United States dollars in salaries and allowances', ' This move has forced the college to engage parents on how best to reach an agreement on this issue', ' The agreements have to be presented to the ministry of education', "" The affected teachers last
