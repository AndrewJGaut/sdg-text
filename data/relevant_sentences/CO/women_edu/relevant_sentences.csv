The Children Parade   Desfile del Carnaval de Los Niños is a parade for children in which school and community dancing groups participate as well as the children kings. The idea of bringing about such a nocturnal parade in the Barranquilla's Carnival dates back to a night in 1958, when Esther forero was at a nocturnal parade in Santiago de Cuba, prompting her to ask around among folklorists about it the following days and hence learning that the parade, named as La Conga Parade, came to existence after many small groups had been gathering from across Santiago de Cuba Province over time. Joselito Carnaval may be either a real person or a dummy, and it is used to be transported either within a coffin or stretches decorated with flowers and surrounded by its crying widows – these crying widows may be men disguised as women –.
