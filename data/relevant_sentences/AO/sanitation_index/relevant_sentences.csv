after the fighting', '  After defeating a FAPLA garrison at the nearby town of Caxito, an army of ELNA militants led personally by Holden Roberto began advancing southwards towards Luanda', ""

launchers"", ""  Following a poorly coordinated artillery bombardment and an ineffectual South African air strike, ELNA light and motorised infantry attacked the bridge early on the morning on 10

initiative', ' Roberto committed his reserves, but by noon his entire force had been routed with heavy casualties and nearly all their vehicles destroyed', ' The ELNA forces broke into a disorderly retreat and could only be re-mustered that evening', ' Realising the battle was lost, the South African and Zairean troops withdrew to the nearby port of Ambriz and were later evacuated by their respective governments', '  While the battle was taking place, Portugal renounced its claims to Angolan sovereignty and withdrew the remainder of its colonial administrative and military personnel from Luanda', "" On the morning of 11 November, the MPLA proclaimed the People's Republic of Angola, which was immediately recognised by Cuba, the Soviet Union, Brazil, and several sympathetic African states"", ' ELNA had suffered such a catastrophic defeat at Quifangondo that Roberto was unable to launch another major offensive; over the next two months his forces were gradually scattered and destroyed by FAPLA and its Cuban allies', '  Background  Since the late fifteenth century, Portugal had administered Angola as part of a vast African empire which included Mozambique and Portuguese Guinea (modern day Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau)', ' Following the loss of Brazil and the erosion of its influence in the Americas during the early nineteenth century, Portugal increasingly refocused on the consolidation of its African colonies', "" As the largest, most developed, and most heavily populated colony in the Portuguese Empire, Angola came to replace Brazil as Lisbon's most valuable overseas possession"", ' Angolan nationalists, led by the nascent Angolan Communist Party, periodically challenged colonial rule, to little avail', ' The trend towards global decolonisation during the late 1940s and 1950s delivered an unprecedented boost to nationalist confidence and ambitions, and in January 1961 the Angolan War of Independence broke out when radicalised peasants launched the Baixa de Cassanje revolt', ""  Between 1961 and 1964, three major nationalist movements rose to prominence in the fighting between the Portuguese security forces and local anti-colonial militants supported to varying degrees by the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and several newly independent African states"", ' The National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA) was led by Holden Roberto and recruited mostly from the Bakongo population of northern Angola and the Cabinda exclave, an area traditionally dominated by the Kingdom of Kongo', ' In the central highlands and southern Angola, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) was formed by Jonas Savimbi and drew its recruits from Ovimbundu farm labourers and itinerant peasants', ' A third movement, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), was formed by the Angolan Communist Party and targeted the embryonic upper working class of public sector workers in Luanda', ' Most of its senior leaders, namely Agostinho Neto, were professionals and intellectuals educated in European universities', ' It was in this educated elite that the combination of anti-colonial resentment and exposure to international political theory came to be most articulated; for example, the MPLA invested heavily in lobbying campaigns overseas which won it support and recognition among political leaders in Africa and the Middle East', ' Its use of Marxist political language and open criticism of the United States in particular proved effective at winning support with the Soviet Union and leftist governments elsewhere', ""  thumb|left|FNLA leader Holden Roberto All three movements quickly formed militant wings to coordinate their insurgent campaigns against the Portuguese: the FNLA formed the National Liberation Army of Angola (ELNA), UNITA formed the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FALA), and the MPLA formed the People's Armed Forces of Liberation of Angola (FAPLA)"", ' The creation of three separate insurgent armies provoked internecine strife which doomed any attempt to present a united front against the Portuguese and limited their effectiveness on the battlefield', ' Until the formation of the militant wings, disputes between the movements had been largely confined to political theory', ' However, beginning in late 1961 there were a number of clashes between ELNA and FAPLA that became central to the rivalry between the FNLA and MPLA, and evolved into outright hostility', ' It was not uncommon for ELNA to intercept and kill FAPLA personnel who strayed into its area of operations', ' Hamstrung by violent divisions, the insurgents aggravated the colonial administration but did not threaten its control of the territory', ""  In late April 1974, Portugal's authoritarian Estado Novo government was toppled by the Carnation Revolution, which sounded the death knell for that country's pretensions as a colonial empire"", ' Angolan nationalists perceived the political upheaval in Lisbon as an opportunity to upend the colonial order; the MPLA, FNLA, and UNITA rejected ceasefire requests and all demanded the Portuguese affirm an unconditional right to independence', ' General António de Spínola, head of the Portuguese provisional government, was initially in favour of retaining the colonies as semi-autonomous federal subjects, but found little support for this measure in the progressive atmosphere which dominated local politics after the revolution', ' On 27 July 1974, he bowed to pressure and announced that the colonies were to be granted independence, unconditionally', '  By November 1974 the authority and morale of the Portuguese security forces in Angola had been seriously undermined; meanwhile, the three nationalist movements were attempting to exploit the developing power vacuum by amassing troops and stockpiling arms', "" The nationalists' political and military wings rushed to establish authority on the ground, moving rapidly to take over key towns left unguarded by the withdrawing Portuguese"", ' Massive shipments of foreign arms from their various allies made the movements increasingly more lethal as tensions grew', ' The insurgents also seized large quantities of Portuguese weapons from the arsenals of disbanding colonial units', ' As long as their administrative structures were not attacked, the Portuguese made no attempt to enforce internal security, and the nationalists were able to continue their troop and weapons buildup unopposed', ""  Prelude ELNA expelled from Luanda

advantage of the situation to begin airlifting ELNA troops into Luanda from their training camps in neighbouring Zaire', ' With each movement extending its influence over the local population, the uneasy peace soon broke down and within a month the capital had erupted into bloody street battles', "" On 3 January 1975, at the behest of Organisation of African Unity, Neto, Roberto, and UNITA's

to be followed by democratic elections', "" Angola's independence date was set for 11 November 1975, the four hundredth anniversary of the founding of Luanda"", ""  Fighting almost immediately broke out in Luanda again when Neto took advantage of the ceasefire to launch a purge of Chipenda's supporters"", ' The Chipenda faction was largely annihilated, leaving ELNA as the only remaining obstacle to FAPLA control of the city', ' Chipenda and 2,000 of his surviving troops defected to ELNA around February, which further heightened tensions', "" ELNA had the largest number of personnel inside Angola at the time, and was further strengthened by over 400 tonnes of weaponry donated by the People's Republic of China and channelled through a sympathetic Zaire"", ' ELNA also benefited from covert financial aid supplied by the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)', "" Roberto was pressed by his field commanders to destroy Neto's forces while he held an indisputable advantage in manpower and logistics over his opponent"", ' On 23 March, ELNA began attacking FAPLA bases in Luanda', ' A week later, a motorised column of 500 ELNA troops drove into the capital to join the fighting, unopposed by the Portuguese troops on duty', "" The threat posed by ELNA's troop buildup was proving far more formidable than Neto had anticipated, and near the end of March he appealed to the Soviet Union and Cuba for military backing"", '  As an ELNA victory in Luanda had become more apparent, Soviet policymakers grew increasingly anxious about Angola', "" They believed that Angola's fate carried heavy implications for the global strategic and diplomatic momentum gained by the Soviet sphere after the end of the Vietnam War"", ' They saw Roberto as an agent of Bakongo tribalism rather than a true revolutionary and assumed that his success would serve the interests of Beijing and Washington', ' The coincidence of Chinese and American patronage of Roberto was especially

massive increase in Soviet military aid to FAPLA"", ' During March 1975 alone, Soviet pilots flew thirty planeloads of weapons into Brazzaville, where they were unloaded and transported by rail, truck, and ship to waiting FAPLA units around Luanda', "" In the span of three months, the Soviet Union had airlifted thirty million dollars' worth of weaponry to FAPLA"", ' Neto had received enough new arms to equip an additional 20,000 troops, and this proved instrumental in turning the tide against Roberto', ' Additionally, a Soviet military delegation offered to provide training instructors and logistics staff during well-publicised talks with the MPLA leadership on 25 April', ' For its part, Cuba deployed a contingent of 230 military advisers and technicians to Angola to assemble Soviet hardware and train an influx of new FAPLA recruits', ' The first Cuban advisers began arriving in May', '  The infusion of Soviet arms helped fuel increasingly heavier confrontations in Luanda and provided the raw material for a major conventional FAPLA counteroffensive', ' In late May FAPLA violated a short-lived ceasefire by attacking and defeating several ELNA garrisons in the Cuanza Norte, Malanje, and Uíge provinces', ' Buoyed by these victories, the MPLA Politburo authorised a counteroffensive with the objective of isolating and destroying ELNA in Luanda', ' Between 3 June and 5 June, FAPLA eliminated the ELNA presence in the Cabinda exclave', ' The Portuguese succeeded in imposing a ceasefire on 7 June, but this was short-lived: the ELNA units stationed in Luanda had been sapped by the fighting in late May and the FAPLA general staff, detecting weakness, was eager to finish them off', "" On 9 July, FAPLA and the MPLA's popular militia resumed their counteroffensive, bringing the full weight of their Soviet-supplied weapons, including mortars and T-34-85 tanks, to bear against the lightly armed ELNA infantry"", ' After several days of street battles, FAPLA was in full possession of Luanda, having driven ELNA out of the capital and its outlying suburbs', ' ELNA released a press statement accusing Cuban advisers of having played a major role in the FAPLA

that it would likewise no longer negotiate peace and would pursue the war until the FNLA and ELNA were permanently defeated', '  Zaire and South Africa intervene  Following its expulsion from Luanda, ELNA withdrew to the nearby port of Ambriz, where it established its new military headquarters and began planning a counteroffensive on Luanda', ' Roberto, who had hitherto directed the war effort from Kinshasa, immediately made preparations to return to Angola and manage all ELNA operations personally', ' He claimed he would capture Luanda before Angolan independence', ' For the time being,

AO-2015-7#-00000388,"[""The Battle of Cassinga also known as the Cassinga Raid or Kassinga Massacre was a controversial South African airborne attack on a South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) military camp at the town of Cassinga, Angola on 4 May 1978"", "" Conducted as one of the three major actions of Operation Reindeer during the South African Border War, it was the South African Army's first major air assault operation"", '  Despite investigations with evidence to the contrary such as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), claims continue that Cassinga was a refugee camp, rather than a military camp, and that consequently the raid was a massacre of civilians rather than a military operation', ""  While there are extensive records covering the SADF's planning and actions around the operation (declassified since the change of government in 1994), no SWAPO records other than photographic evidence of the mass grave exist"", '  Background  Starting in 1976, SWAPO PLAN combatants regularly travelled south by road from Huambo through Cassinga, an abandoned Angolan mining town that was located about halfway to the battlefront at the Namibian border', ' The town had about twenty buildings that previously served the local iron-ore mine as warehouses, accommodation and offices', '  A group of PLAN guerrillas led by Dimo Hamaambo occupied Cassinga some weeks after they began using it as a stopover point; according to both Charles ""Ho Chi Minh"" Namoloh and Mwetufa ""Cabral"" Mupopiwa, who accompanied Hamaambo when the village was first occupied, the first Namibian inhabitants of Cassinga consisted entirely of trained PLAN combatants', '  Not long after the establishment of the PLAN camp at Cassinga, it began to function also as a transit camp for Namibian exiles', '  The Angolan government allocated the abandoned village to SWAPO in 1976 to cope with the influx of thousands of refugees from South West Africa, estimated in May 1978 to total 3,000 to 4,000 people', '  Two days before the South African raid, UNICEF reported of a ""well-run and well-organized"" camp but ""ill-equipped"" to cope with the rapid refugee increase in early 1978', ' The Cubans, who set up a base at nearby Techamutete when they intervened in the war in 1975, provided logistical support to the SWAPO administration at Cassinga', '  \t\t  According to SADF intelligence, ""Logistic planning and the provision of supplies, weapons and ammunition to insurgents operating in central and eastern Ovamboland were undertaken from Cassinga"", which they learned from PLAN POWs was codenamed ""Moscow""', '  Medical treatment of the seriously wounded as well as the repair of equipment and the assembly of newly trained insurgents on their way to bases in the East and West Cunene Provinces all took place in Cassinga', '""  South African planning  By the beginning of 1978 SWAPO had improved its organisation and gained strength in Owambo and the Eastern Caprivi, UNITA was under pressure from the MPLA, and it became increasingly difficult for the SADF to operate in Southern Angola', ' South Africa also feared the disruption of elections it planned to hold in South West Africa excluding SWAPO', '  The attack on Cassinga grew out of the plan for Operation Bruilof, wherein the SADF envisaged attacking six SWAPO targets around the town of Chetequera', "" During the intelligence-gathering portion of the planning for Operation Bruilof, the SADF concluded that the small town of Cassinga was the principal medical, training and control centre for the guerrillas in the region, and one of SWAPO's two regional HQ's (the other being further north at Lubango)"", '  The SAAF still held air superiority over Angola at the time, allowing 12 Squadron to conduct aerial photo-reconnaissance with Canberra B12s in spring of 1978', ""  These photos showed newly built military infrastructure including concreted 'drive-in' bunkers for armoured fighting vehicles covering approach roads, zigzag trenches surrounding the base, foxholes for machine guns/mortar crews – and the highly characteristic 'star-shaped' concreted base structure for a SAM-3 missile battery and its radar/command vehicle"", ' Also identifiable from the imagery was a civilian single-decker bus', '   PLAN combatants at Cassinga were aware of the overflights, and in a letter dated 10 April 1978, the camp\'s commander Hamaambo expressed concerns to his superiors about an ""imminent invasion intention of our enemy of our camp in Southern Angola""', '  In response to the reconnaissance flights, defenses were improved through the creation of a secondary camp north of the main camp, the addition of more trenches and the digging of holes for the protection of food provisions', '  The SADF shelved the plan for Operation Bruilof and planning for a new operation, Operation Reindeer, began', ' Reindeer was composed of three main actions; the airborne assault on Cassinga, a mechanised assault on the Chetaquera complex at  – that also involved SAAF defence-suppression strikes – and an assault on the Dombondola complex at  by a light infantry force', '  The planners for the operation were faced with a significant problem', ' While the Chetequera and Dombondola complexes were only around 35\xa0km from the border with South West Africa/Namibia (then under South African control), therefore making conventional assault possible, Cassinga was 260\xa0km from the border and deep inside Angola', "" This meant that any conventional assault force would have to fight its way in and out, and would almost certainly have given advance warning to the PLAN (People's Liberation Army of Namibia – SWAPO's armed wing) soldiers in Cassinga, allowing them and leaders like Jerobeum 'Dimo' Amaambo (the PLAN commander-in-chief, then resident in Cassinga) and Greenwell Matongo to escape"", ' Cassinga furthermore was located on a small hill, flanked by a river on its West side, and open fields in other directions, factors that combined to give any defenders the advantage', ""  However, South African Defence Force (SADF) intelligence reports had ascertained that SWAPO – and probably its advisers – was lulled into a false sense of security because of Cassinga's distance from the Namibian border to the south"", ' South African military intelligence briefings before the event indicated no awareness of any nearby supportive infantry or armoured units to support the base against a ground assault, and although SWAPO had been constructing a system of integrated defensive trenches and firing points for wheeled/tracked AFVs and AAA units, they were not then prepared for a joint-arms airborne attack', '  The SADF had not previously demonstrated any such capability, giving military analysts no reason to suspect that such an option was available to the SADF planners', '  The planners therefore believed that they could conduct a surprise attack on the base using only a lightly-armed airborne force', ' Earlier in that year, SAAF 12 Squadron had commenced training for a low-level strike role, utilising anti-personnel weapons such as cluster bombs', '  The South Africans knew about the success of Operation Eland and Operation Dingo, pre-emptive raids conducted in the previous two years by the Rhodesian Selous Scouts against guerilla forces based in Mozambique, and modeled their raid on many of the same principles', '  Though a risky plan it was decided that the element of surprise would outweigh the disadvantage of not having supporting armour on the ground', '  The SADF decided to mount a large airborne assault on Cassinga (by now code-named ""Alpha""), supported by South African Air Force (SAAF) fighter-bombers and a fleet of 17 medium-transport helicopters', ' Using an exercise already underway called Exercise Kwiksilver as a cover story, the army initiated a call up of the Citizen Force (reserve units similar to the US National Guard) parachute units', ' The paratroopers conducted refresher training at the base of 1 Parachute Battalion (1 Bn) in Bloemfontein and then field training in the area surrounding the derelict Rheinholdtskop farm on the De Brug Training Area', '  A top secret document prepared by General Magnus Malan for the then Minister of Defence, P', ' W', ' Botha, refers to Cassinga as ""a large SWAPO base located 260\xa0km north of the border', 'The border referred to here is the Namibian–Angolan border', ' It is the operational military headquarters of SWAPO from where all operations against SWA are planned and their execution co-ordinated', ' From this base all supplies and armaments are provided to the bases further forward', '  Here training also takes place', '  In short, it is probably the most important SWAPO base in Angola', '  The nearest Cuban base is 15\xa0km South of Alpha', '""  The South African cabinet was hesitant to authorise the operation, fearing an international backlash, but on 2 May 1978 the Prime Minister, John Vorster, finally approved the operation', '  The date of 4 May was specifically chosen as it was after the United Nations Security Council debate on South West Africa ended so as to ""avoid making lives difficult for those countries favourable to South Africa""', '  Composition of forces  South Africa right|300px|thumb|Airborne forces committed to the battle Because of the secrecy involved in the operation, and the commitment of most of the professional ""permanent force"" troops and ""national servicemen"" conscripts of 1 Bn in other operations, it was decided to use 2 and 3 Parachute Battalions (2 Bn & 3 Bn), both reserve or ""Citizen Force"" units, in the operation', ' However, the need for secrecy meant not enough Citizen Force soldiers could be called up to fill both Parachute Battalions', ' As a result, all three were temporarily merged into a single composite Parachute Battalion, which was commanded by Colonel Jan Breytenbach', ' The final composition of forces for the attack on Cassinga was therefore the following:   The entire operation was run by Major General Ian Gleeson, who commanded the SWA Tactical HQ (set up specially for Operation Reindeer)', '   Overall control of the airborne forces was given to Brigadier M', 'J', ' du Plessis, who commanded the Parachute Brigade HQ', ' The units under his command were the Composite Parachute Battalion under Colonel Breytenbach that was composed of A, B, C and D companies (all under-strength), an independent rifle platoon, a mortar platoon and an anti-tank platoon;   The Helicopter Administration Area (HAA) protection force under Major James Hills, consisting of two Hawk Groups (10-man sections of rapid-reaction paratroopers) from 1 Bn;   An Airborne Reserve under Captain Wesley de Beer, consisting of a company from 2 Bn airborne in a C', '160 to be used in the event of reinforcements being required, and the Mobile Air Operations Team (MAOT) under Commandant James Kriel, which consisted of five SAAF personnel to set up and run the HAA', ' All the paratroopers were equipped with a folding stock version of the R1 7', '62\xa0mm assault rifle', '  The South African Air Force contribution consisted of four C-130 Hercules and five C', '160 Transall transport aircraft', ' The helicopter component of the operation consisted of 13 Pumas and six Super Frelons', '  The air attack component provided by the SAAF consisted of four Canberra B-12 bombers, each carrying 300 Alpha anti-personnel bombs; five Buccaneers carrying eight  bombs each, as well as a sixth carrying seventy-two 68\xa0mm rockets, and lastly four Mirage III fighter aircraft, armed only with Sidewinder air-to-air missiles and their 30\xa0mm cannons fitted with high-explosive fragmentation shells', '  One crew from the Canberra squadron was tasked with acquiring further photo-reconnaissance imagery, some to be used in the preparation of photo-strip maps for the Tactical Low Flying (TLF) legs that the various aircraft types would undertake – there being inadequate conventional mapping of much of the region – and additional and up-to-date detailed imagery of the Cassinga environs for the Parabat drop zone and Buccaneer target planning purposes', ' Particular attention was paid to identifying units of AAA deployed in/near the target complex', ' It was during this phase that a serious error was made, with potentially disastrous consequences', '  Air-photo interpreters put the wrong scale on some of the maps that were used in the planning, despite the altimeter readings being clearly visible in the original reconnaissance photographs', "" Consequently, the air force planners overestimated the size of the DZ, believing it was long and wide enough to drop the paratroopers, when in fact it wasn't"", "" This 'scale error' also mispositioned the 'Warning' and 'Drop' points on the run-in to drop"", "" Compounding this error, the pilot of the lead aircraft was momentarily distracted by the effects of the bombing, and issued the 'jump' signal a few seconds late"", ' The net effect was that many paratroopers overshot their intended DZs, many landing beyond the river – and some in it', '  Playing a supporting role was a single Cessna C-185, which flew in the target area and acted as an observation post as well as a radio relay aircraft', ' In addition there was a single DC-4 Strikemaster fitted out as an EW and ELINT aircraft flying over the SWA/Namibia border with Angola', ' The purpose of this latter aircraft was to both intercept all Angolan, Cuban and SWAPO radio transmissions, before jamming their communications networks at the appropriate time', ' The successful jamming of the SWAPO, Angolan and Cuban communications network is one of the reasons for the late reaction by either of the latter two in responding to the attack', '  PLAN PLAN, the armed wing of SWAPO, was a guerrilla army and therefore did not have a traditional command and control structure', ' As such, it is impossible to determine a composition of units inside Cassinga', ' According to TRC findings, a self-defence unit posted at Cassinga consisted of approximately 300 male and female PLAN cadres (other source: approximately 300 to 600)', ' The military section of Cassinga was easily partitioned from the non-military sections', ' The overall commander of PLAN in town was Dimo Amaambo, who responsible for the co-ordination of all PLAN actions in Southern Angola, including incursions into South West Africa/Namibia', ' A headquarters such as Cassinga was second in importance only to Lubango, which was the overall SWAPO military headquarters in Angola', ' Aside from the system of trenches and bunkers, defensive equipment included two ZPU-4 14', '5\xa0mm anti-aircraft guns, one ZU-23-2 23\xa0mm gun, and around one or two ZSU 12', '7\xa0mm guns', ' These were capable of being used in a ground attack role', '  Cuba The nearest Cuban military presence was 15\xa0km south of Cassinga, at the village of Techamutete, located at ', ' It consisted of a reinforced mechanised battalion of at least four T-34 tanks, 17 BTR-152 armoured personnel carriers, seven trucks and four anti-aircraft guns, accompanied by around 400 troops', ' This unit was known to SADF intelligence, who had intercepted their radio traffic, and were also aware of their anti-UNITA operations', ' Their strength was estimated at 144 in October 1977, and was a major contributing factor in the choice of air rather than a ground assault', "" In briefing the strike aircrew, the SAAF Chief of Staff Intelligence was specific that there was no known military formation within 80 miles, except for a detachment of 'African police' with one truck"", "" In debriefs, when questioned by commanders and aircrew of the 2 strike components, Canberras and Buccaneers, he insisted that the Cuban formation being just some 15\xa0km to the south at Tetchamutete was 'a complete surprise and must have been deployed there in recent days'"", ' Certainly, no photo reconnaissance over that village/road junction was ordered, but could easily have been included in the later Canberra PR overflights of Cassinga', '  Attack  04h00 – 09h00  Air movements thumb|right|SAAF Canberra bomber The first to move on the morning of the attack were the paratroopers of the Composite Para Bn, who got up at 04h00 and began fitting their weapons, equipment and parachutes', '  At 05h19, the four Buccaneers bombers took off from AFB Waterkloof, followed at 05h43 by the faster Canberra', "" The heavily laden 'Buccs' could fly only at medium altitude, so their true airspeed (TAS) was considerably lower than that of the 'Cans', flying over  higher"", ' One of the Buccaneers went to an air force base nearer to the Angolan border in order to refuel and act as a close air support (CAS) aircraft, while the fifth aircraft of the Buccaneer strike force was delayed due to a brake problem, leaving four Buccaneers available for the initial strike', '  At 06h00 the eight transport aircraft carrying the paratroopers became airborne', ' Two of the Transall C-160s, carrying the reserve company of 116 paratroopers, peeled off and entered a holding pattern just south of the border so as to be available to drop reinforcements during the battle', ' The remaining six transports continued on towards a holding point some miles east of Cassinga', '  At about 06h30, the ELINT/EW Douglas DC-4 became airborne and settled into a holding pattern just south of the border', "" At the same time, a flight of two Puma helicopters, under the command of Major John Church, took off from 'a jungle night-stop' to fly to a clearing 22\xa0km east of Cassinga in order to set up a Helicopter Administration Area (HAA), where the helicopters used in the operation could refuel"", "" On board the two helicopters were Commandant James Kriel, the commander of the South African Air Force's Mobile Air Operations Team (MAOT) and his signaller, as well as Major James Hills, commander of Bravo Company, 1 Bn, along with one ten-man section from the two Hawk Groups he would be using to protect the HAA"", ' Also in the two helicopters were six 200-litre drums of helicopter fuel, and, to the consternation of Hills, the Chief of the South African Army, Lieutenant-General Constand Viljoen', '  The MAOT set up their radios and navigational beacons at the HAA, by now code-named Whisky-Three, and signalled the all-clear for the rest of the force, consisting of the rest of the Hawk Group protection element (31 paratroopers), six medical personnel, two more members of the MAOT and eighty-six 200-litre drums of helicopter fuel, all on board a fleet of five Super Frelon and ten Puma helicopters', ' The HAA was then completed, and the 17 helicopters refuelled and waited for the call to extract the paratroopers after the completion of the attack', '  Also at around 07h00 the solitary Cessna C-185 took off and began flying towards Cassinga', ' Its role in the operation was to be an airborne observation post, giving the all-clear for the paratrooper drop, as well as being a radio-relay aircraft (known as ""Telstar duty"" in the SAAF)', ' It would later be forced to withdraw due to sustained anti-aircraft fire', ' At around 07h50 two Mirage III fighter aircraft took off, heading straight for Cassinga', '  Bombing runs The defence-suppression bombing attack by the Canberras was two minutes late, occurring at 08h02 instead of 08h00 as originally planned, because the lead navigator failing to maintain effective timing-adjustment during the  low-level approach phase', ' This made no difference to the intended effect', "" As the bombing had been timed to coincide with SWAPO's daily roll call on the parade ground, most of the people in the camp were assembled in the open when the Canberras initiated their low-level fragmentation bomb attack from the north"", ' Each of the four Canberras – flying in loose \'line abreast\' at  and 300 knots – dropped 300 Rhodesian-designed ""Alpha"" fragmentation bombs, which were small  finless bombs like \'10-Pin Bowling\' balls, designed to bounce up to  into the air before detonating', "" A zone of some 800 metres by 500 metres was carpeted, each aircraft having its own 'bomb line'"", ' The weapons were devastatingly effective against the assembled groupings below, causing most of SWAPO\'s casualties on the day, and also destroying vehicles, POL (""Petroleum Oil Lubricants"", military acronym for flammable liquids) storage tanks and soft buildings', '  Immediately after the Canberras came the Buccaneers, from the west, who flew their dive-bombing runs along a generally east–west axis', ' Photography from the cockpit of one of the aircraft showed the graphic lines of the preceding ""Alpha"" bomb strikes, was released to the SA press the following day', "" Of the total of thirty-two 1000\xa0lb (450\xa0kg) conventional bombs dropped by the four Buccaneers on the identified 'hard points', 24 scored direct hits, causing an immense amount of damage"", ' Finally, the two Mirage IIIs conducted a strafing run on the target, using their 30\xa0mm DEFA cannons', ' All the aircraft except for the solitary Buccaneer on CAS duty then flew back to air bases in South West Africa (Namibia) to refuel and re-arm to provide close air support if required – the Mirages to Ondangwa air force base, the Canberras, Buccaneers and C-130/C-160s to Grootfontein air force base, where their support teams and material had been ferried up from Pretoria during the morning', ' The Canberras and Buccaneers were used for a later strike on the Chetequera complex', '  Parachute drop After the attack aircraft had finished their bombing runs the six transports, which had been holding in wait to the east, commenced their formation run towards Cassinga at an altitude of 200 feet (60 m)', ' Shortly before reaching the base, the six aircraft climbed to , the drop height, and lined up for the drop', "" However, required visual 'tracking and distance' co-ordination markers were obscured by smoke from the bombing run, the drop zone (DZ) box scaling and drop point distances were incorrect – due to the reconnaissance scaling errors – and the drop was a shambles with nearly all the paratroopers being dropped off-target, some on the West side of the river and some into tall maize where they had problems linking up"", "" The resultant confusion caused numerous delays, ruining the schedule of the 'drop-to-contact' plan, and much of the advantage of surprise"", ' The disastrous drop also meant that it would be nearly an hour before C-Company was able to move into position on the eastern side of the camp and seal off the escape routes and as a result a number of top PLAN commanders, including Dimo Amaambo and Greenwell Matongo (two principal targets of the attack) escaped (with Amaambo later becoming the first head of the Namibian Defence Force in 1990)', '  The two independent rifle platoons, No', '9 and No', '11, were dropped quite accurately to the north', ' They immediately went into action, moving through a tented camp to the north-west of Cassinga, beyond the bombed areas', ' Resistance was fierce but short-lived, and a total of 54 bodies were counted by the platoons before they took up their position along the northern end of the base to seal off that escape route', '  Of the four main paratrooper companies, D-Company had experienced the most accurate drop, though they were still 500 m from their intended drop zone', ' Regrouping quickly, they moved to attack structures which had been identified in the aerial reconnaissance photos as engineering buildings', ' However, during the assault on these buildings several of them exploded, perhaps due to ammunition stores within, injuring several paratroopers', ' There was also a brief blue-on-blue engagement as D-Company paratroopers were mistakenly fired upon by their fellow soldiers from B-Company, which by then had reached the base, but there were no casualties', ' After completing the assault of the engineer complex, D-Company moved south to set up a stop-line and prevent any guerrillas from escaping via that route', ' It also dispatched the anti-tank platoon to lay a tank ambush on the road to Techamutete', '  09h00 – 12h00 By 09h00, A and B Companies had regrouped and were ready to commence the main assault on Cassinga', ' Instead of attacking eastwards as initially planned, the two companies attacked the base in a northerly direction', ' Initially, they encountered very little resistance, though this changed dramatically once the paratroopers neared the centre of the base', ' Heavy sniper fire was directed at the paratroopers from a number of trees inside the base, they were subjected to B-10 recoilless rifle fire, and some SWAPO guerrillas had regrouped, using houses as cover from which to fire at the paratroopers, critically wounding two paratroopers', '  thumb|ZPU-2 anti-aircraft gun However, the paratroopers faced their greatest challenge when they were fired upon by a number of ZPU-2 14', '5\u2009mm multi-barrel anti-aircraft guns used in the ground role', ' This brought both companies to a complete halt, as they were unable to move under the accurate, and close, fire of the guns, and the Buccaneer on CAS duty could not conduct a strike on the guns for fear of hitting the paratroopers close by', '  In the end, Colonel Breytenbach ordered the commander of D-Company to take some men and work up towards the guns by attacking the trenches to the west of Cassinga', ' He also ordered the mortar platoon to begin attacking the guns', '  Upon entering the trenches, the men from D-Company were surprised to find a number of civilians, whom they later asserted were being used as human shields by the guerrillas hiding inside', '  The guerrillas opened fire on the paratroopers, leading the paratroopers to enter what they described later as a mode of ""kill or be killed"", in which preventing the deaths of the civilians in the trenches was allegedly impossible', "" Though a number of civilians were killed in those trenches, as the paratroopers moved forward encountered less and less civilians until nearer the guns all those in the trenches, male and female, were wearing SWAPO's Cuban-style uniforms"", ' In the meantime, 9 Platoon had entered the trenches from the north, though were making slow progress as they came under the attention of the gunners', '  After a combination of the attack through the trenches and the mortar fire, the guns were silenced', ' The toll was an acceptable one for the South Africans; there were at least 95 SWAPO fighters dead inside the trenches and around the guns', ' Three paratroopers had been killed', '  After the fall of the guns, all major resistance in Cassinga ended', ' The odd sniper and corners of light resistance were all that remained, and the mopping up process was soon finished', ' The paratroopers immediately set up the Bn HQ and Regimental Aid-Post (RAP) next to the SWAPO hospital, and began treating the worst of the injured', ' Overall, three paratroopers had been killed, and eleven wounded, two of them critically', ' In addition, a fourth paratrooper was found to be missing, presumed killed', ' It was later assumed that he had drowned after being dropped in the river during the parachute jump, or that his parachute had malfunctioned', '  By now the attack was two hours behind schedule, with the first helicopter extractions having been planned for 10h00', '  12h00 – 15h00 Brigadier Du Plessis at this time informed Colonel Breytenbach of a radio interception, indicating that the Cuban force at Techamutete was deploying', '  The SADF had been given explicit operational instructions to avoid conflict with the Cubans, but delays on the part of SADF now made that a distinct possibility', ' Brigadier Du Plessis insisted on extracting all the troops immediately, however Colonel Breytenbach wanted to secure the LZ first', ' A compromise was agreed whereby half the paratroopers would move to the LZ where 12 Puma helicopters would extract them, while the remainder would continue clearing operations, as well as to collect any and all documents of intelligence value', '  At around 13h00, Colonel Breytenbach was informed by one of the Buccaneers on CAS duty that the Cuban mechanised battalion was moving up the road from Techamutete to Cassinga', '  The Buccaneer had spotted an advancing column of around 30 assorted AFVs, APCs, T-34 tanks and other vehicles advancing slowly up the road from Techamutete', ' It immediately opened fire on the column, destroying three BTR-152 armoured personnel carriers in the process, but then had to return to Grootfontein air force base to re-arm and refuel, leaving about 200 of the remaining paratroopers temporarily unprotected', ' All that stood between them and the advancing armoured column were the 22 men of the anti-tank platoon, armed only with 10 RPG-7 rocket launchers and five anti-tank mines which they had planted in the road', ""  At this time however, there was a serious breakdown in the South Africans' command and control, and a number of fundamental errors were made"", ' The shuttle of helicopters to and from Whiskey-Three, the HAA, as well as the order in which paratroopers were embarked, was improvised and initially uncoordinated and disorganised', "" It wasn't made initially clear to the commander of the helicopter extraction force quite what the problem – and the sudden urgency – was"", ' Furthermore, two engineers, whose role was to destroy enemy equipment, departed in the first wave with all the demolition fuses before all the equipment had been disabled', '  Meanwhile, the Cuban column advanced directly into the ambush that the paratroopers had set for them', '  The lead T-34 tank was destroyed by one of the anti-tank mines, while the paratroopers destroyed four of the BTR-152s using their RPG-7s', "" They also killed approximately 40 of the Cuban troops before making their 'fighting retreat' back along the road towards the Helicopter Landing Zone (HLZ) east of Cassinga where Breytenbach was organising the remaining paratroopers for final extraction"", ' In the face of the oncoming armoured column, Breytenbach ordered a thin defensive line, but realised the lightly armed paratroopers stood little chance against the armoured vehicles and prepared to fall-back into the bush to an emergency LZ while calling urgently for air support', '  The initial success of the SADF assault now looked like turning into a disaster with the imminent prospect of being overrun by Cuban armoured forces,  into enemy territory', ' General Viljoen, who until this time had been wearing his rank and beret, removed and hid them', '  At 14h20, when the Cuban AFVs were already in sight of the beleaguered paratroopers, a Buccaneer and two Mirage IIIs arrived overhead', ' An experienced Forward Air Controller (FAC) amongst the paratroopers began to direct the three aircraft in strikes against the advancing Cuban armour', ' The Mirage IIIs, with their 30\xa0mm cannons, destroyed 10 BTR-152s before running low on fuel and returning to Ondangwa air force base', "" The Mirages' cannons were unable to destroy any tanks, but the sole Buccaneer destroyed at least two tanks, an anti-aircraft position and a number of other vehicles with its 68\xa0mm SNEB air-to-ground rockets"", ' The rockets had been omitted from the original Operation Order, but the Buccaneer Squadron Commander had fortuitously chosen to include them in the ordnance that was ferried to the Grootfontein forward air force base by C-130 Hercules, with his ground crews and maintenance spares', ' The Buccaneer pilot was being fired on continually by a towed 14', '5\xa0mm anti-aircraft gun, at which he had to make two passes before he was able to destroy it with rockets', '  The Buccaneer ran out of ammunition at this point, but this coincided with the arrival of the 17 helicopters to extract the remaining paratroopers in the second wave', "" The helicopters' arrival betrayed the position of the LZ to the remaining Cuban forces, who began to advance on the area"", ' While unable to see the armoured vehicles, the paratroopers could hear their engines and gunfire, and could see trees being flattened in their path barely  away', "" In a desperate attempt to prevent the Cuban tanks from firing at the vulnerable helicopters and the assembling SA troops waiting to be picked up, the Buccaneer pilot dived his aircraft dangerously low, nearly hitting trees as he flew close over the top of the tanks in mock attacks, disorienting the crews and forcing them to break off their developing attack on the Parabats' positions"", ' There were several holes in the airframe, including one on the armoured front visor glass, needing swift patching by groundcrew after landing, refuelling and re-arming', '  Because of the disorganisation with the first wave of helicopters, there was nearly not enough space for all the remaining paratroopers and prisoners on the second wave', ' In the ensuing chaos and panic to scramble aboard the helicopters, 40\xa0SWAPO prisoners, intended to be taken back to South West Africa for interrogation, had to be released to lighten the aircraft', ' Some excess equipment and ammunition was also dumped from the overloaded helicopters', ' A final barrage of fire from the paratroopers stalled the closing Cuban armour just sufficiently long enough to complete the extraction of the assembled paratroops', '  However ten minutes after taking off, two of the Puma helicopters were directed to return to Cassinga, as it was feared that some of the paratroopers might have been left behind', ' They spotted a group of people huddled together, but closer inspection revealed that they were the prisoners who had been left behind', ' The helicopters flew a total of four low passes looking for paratroopers, when one of the helicopter pilots spotted a Cuban tank appearing from the bushes', ' He warned the other Puma pilot, who was able to bank away just in time so that the tank round missed the aircraft', ' No paratroopers were found and the two Pumas returned to the HAA', ' The dismantling of the HAA continued throughout the rest of the day', '  15h00 – 18h00 At 15h00, one of the Mirage IIIs returned to Cassinga, and once again strafed the Cuban vehicles that were still on the road, setting at least one of them alight', ' It was replaced at 15h30 by another aircraft and a Buccaneer which proceeded to destroy more of the vehicles and a building', ' About a kilometre south of Cassinga, the Buccaneer attacked another column of vehicles, coming under heavy anti-aircraft fire in the process', '  Another Buccaneer arrived at 16h45, surprised some Cubans moving through the ruins and destroyed a T-34 tank and some anti-aircraft guns in the process, while further Mirage and Buccaneer strikes at 17h10 and 18h35 destroyed another tank and other equipment', ""  The result was that by nightfall nearly the entire Cuban battalion had been destroyed, killing around 150 Cuban soldiers, accounting for that country's biggest single-day casualty rate during its military involvement in Angola"", '  A complete Angolan tank brigade relief force, arriving at dusk, was too late to have any impact and found only scenes of destruction at what had once been Cassinga', '  Aftermath According to an Angolan government white paper, the official toll of the Cassinga Raid was a total of 624 dead and 611 injured civilians as well as combatants', ' Among the dead were 167 women and 298 teenagers and children', ' Since many of the combatants were female or teenagers and many combatants did not wear uniforms, the exact number of civilians among the dead could not be established', '  A secret report to the SWAPO Central Committee listed 582 dead and 400 wounded', '  The South Africans declared the attack on Cassinga to be a great military success, even though disaster was so closely averted by the intervention of the SAAF, and in the face of a SWAPO propaganda campaign that labelled the event a massacre', '  Despite inflicting heavy casualties, the SADF did not kill or capture Dimo Amaambo or any other senior SWAPO leaders', '  The SADF casualties were low for such an attack, an important factor in South Africa where the public was intolerant of high casualty rates: Three soldiers were killed, one was missing in action presumed dead (landed in river, failed to emerge), and eleven were wounded', '  According to General Constand Viljoen, Cassinga set the strategy for the SADF for the next ten years, i', 'e', ' that of launching pre-emptive strikes at SWAPO inside Angola, even though subsequent actions would be armoured rather than air assaults', '  SWAPO launched Operation Revenge, a retaliatory bombardment of Katima Mulilo in the Caprivi Strip on 23 August 1978, during which 10 soldiers were killed and 10 injured as a result of a direct hit on their barracks by an 82\xa0mm mortar bomb', '  Sixteen guerrillas were killed in a SADF follow-up operation  into Zambia', '  Political consequences thumb|One of the mass graves at Cassinga  According to General Geldenhuys the raid was a ""jewel of military craftmanship"", but politically it was a disaster for the apartheid regime', ' A media campaign had been carefully prepared well in advance of the operation and media releases managed in order to create an impression that SADF intervention was at the request of the SWA administration, and to counter negative reports on South African military actions and claims of killing innocent civilians', ' This campaign included the fabrication and distortion of SWAPO actions', ' One of the parachute battalions was specifically tasked to take photographs and instructed to focus on images supporting the South African cause; bodies were only to be photographed with weapons by their side', ' Negative images, such as suffering victims, were to be avoided', ' Nevertheless, in spite of these instructions, pictures of bodies without weapons and of dead SADF paratroopers were taken', 'SADF photographs by Mike McWilliams included pictures of bodies without weapons, and pictures of dead SADF paratroopers', '  The Angolans were first to publish details of the attack, followed shortly thereafter by SWAPO press statements that supported and elaborated on the Angolan account', '  They described the base as a refugee camp and claimed the SADF had slaughtered 600 defenceless refugees', ' The bodies were buried in two mass graves at Cassinga; pictures of one of the mass graves was used extensively for propaganda purposes, and for many people therefore became the imagery that they associated with the event', '  The debate over whether Cassinga was a military camp or a refugee camp (or both) continues to rage', '  Weapons and military installations were present and documented at the camp', ' In 1998 the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission also concluded that  The United Nations invited SWAPO-leader Sam Nujoma to address the council before issuing United Nations Security Council Resolution 428 on 6 May condemning South Africa for ""the armed invasion of Angola carried out on 4 May 1978""', ' The Council condemned apartheid and the continued occupation of Southwest Africa and commended Angola for its support of the Namibian people', '  After independence, the new government of Namibia declared 4 May as ""Cassinga Day"", a public holiday to commemorate the loss of life during the raid', ' In 2007, the names of the Cuban soldiers who were killed were carved into the wall of Freedom Park in South Africa', '  Official celebration of this event by the SANDF ended only in 1996, two years after Nelson Mandela was elected president', ' Veterans of the various South African parachute battalions

last serious attempt by ELNA forces to seize Luanda, the Angolan capital', ' It occurred on the last day of Portuguese colonial rule in the country, which formally received independence only hours after the fighting', '  After defeating a FAPLA garrison at the nearby town of Caxito, an army of ELNA militants led personally by Holden Roberto began advancing southwards towards Luanda', ""

launchers"", ""  Following a poorly coordinated artillery bombardment and an ineffectual South African air strike, ELNA light and motorised infantry attacked the bridge early on the morning on 10 November, but became trapped in the open while crossing an elevated roadway and shelled by the defenders' rockets"", ' The ELNA advance stalled, and the attackers were unable to regain their initiative', ' Roberto committed his reserves, but by noon his entire force had been routed with heavy casualties and nearly all their vehicles destroyed', ' The ELNA forces broke into a disorderly retreat and could only be re-mustered that evening', ' Realising the battle was lost, the South African and Zairean troops withdrew to the nearby port of Ambriz and were later evacuated by their respective governments', '  While the battle was taking place, Portugal renounced its claims to Angolan sovereignty and withdrew the remainder of its colonial administrative and military personnel from Luanda', "" On the morning of 11 November, the MPLA proclaimed the People's Republic of Angola, which was immediately recognised by Cuba, the Soviet Union, Brazil, and several sympathetic African states"", ' ELNA had suffered such a catastrophic defeat at Quifangondo that Roberto was unable to launch another major offensive; over the next two months his forces were gradually scattered and destroyed by FAPLA and its Cuban allies', '  Background  Since the late fifteenth century, Portugal had administered Angola as part of a vast African empire which included Mozambique and Portuguese Guinea (modern day Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau)', ' Following the loss of Brazil and the erosion of its influence in the Americas during the early nineteenth century, Portugal increasingly refocused on the consolidation of its African colonies', "" As the largest, most developed, and most heavily populated colony in the Portuguese Empire, Angola came to replace Brazil as Lisbon's most valuable overseas possession"", ' Angolan nationalists, led by the nascent Angolan Communist Party, periodically challenged colonial rule, to little avail', ' The trend towards global decolonisation during the late 1940s and 1950s delivered an unprecedented boost to nationalist confidence and ambitions, and in January 1961 the Angolan War of Independence broke out when radicalised peasants launched the Baixa de Cassanje revolt', ""  Between 1961 and 1964, three major nationalist movements rose to prominence in the fighting between the Portuguese security forces and local anti-colonial militants supported to varying degrees by the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and several newly independent African states"", ' The National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA) was led by Holden Roberto and recruited mostly from the Bakongo population of northern Angola and the Cabinda exclave, an area traditionally dominated by the Kingdom of Kongo', ' In the central highlands and southern Angola, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) was formed by Jonas Savimbi and drew its recruits from Ovimbundu farm labourers and itinerant peasants', ' A third movement, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), was formed by the Angolan Communist Party and targeted the embryonic upper working class of public sector workers in Luanda', ' Most of its senior leaders, namely Agostinho Neto, were professionals and intellectuals educated in European universities', ' It was in this educated elite that the combination of anti-colonial resentment and exposure to international political theory came to be most articulated; for example, the MPLA invested heavily in lobbying campaigns overseas which won it support and recognition among political leaders in Africa and the Middle East', ' Its use of Marxist political language and open criticism of the United States in particular proved effective at winning support with the Soviet Union and leftist governments elsewhere', ""  thumb|left|FNLA leader Holden Roberto All three movements quickly formed militant wings to coordinate their insurgent campaigns against the Portuguese: the FNLA formed the National Liberation Army of Angola (ELNA), UNITA formed the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FALA), and the MPLA formed the People's Armed Forces of Liberation of Angola (FAPLA)"", ' The creation of three separate insurgent armies provoked internecine strife which doomed any attempt to present a united front against the Portuguese and limited their effectiveness on the battlefield', ' Until the formation of the militant wings, disputes between the movements had been largely confined to political theory', ' However, beginning in late 1961 there were a number of clashes between ELNA and FAPLA that became central to the rivalry between the FNLA and MPLA, and evolved into outright hostility', ' It was not uncommon for ELNA to intercept and kill FAPLA personnel who strayed into its area of operations', ' Hamstrung by violent divisions, the insurgents aggravated the colonial administration but did not threaten its control of the territory', ""  In late April 1974, Portugal's authoritarian Estado Novo government was toppled by the Carnation Revolution, which sounded the death knell for that country's pretensions as a colonial empire"", ' Angolan nationalists perceived the political upheaval in Lisbon as an opportunity to upend the colonial order; the MPLA, FNLA, and UNITA rejected ceasefire requests and all demanded the Portuguese affirm an unconditional right to independence', ' General António de Spínola, head of the Portuguese provisional government, was initially in favour of retaining the colonies as semi-autonomous federal subjects, but found little support for this measure in the progressive atmosphere which dominated local politics after the revolution', ' On 27 July 1974, he bowed to pressure and announced that the colonies were to be granted independence, unconditionally', '  By November 1974 the authority and morale of the Portuguese security forces in Angola had been seriously undermined; meanwhile, the three nationalist movements were attempting to exploit the developing power vacuum by amassing troops and stockpiling arms', "" The nationalists' political and military wings rushed to establish authority on the ground, moving rapidly to take over key towns left unguarded by the withdrawing Portuguese"", ' Massive shipments of foreign arms from their various allies made the movements increasingly more lethal as tensions grew', ' The insurgents also seized large quantities of Portuguese weapons from the arsenals of disbanding colonial units', ' As long as their administrative structures were not attacked, the Portuguese made no attempt to enforce internal security, and the nationalists were able to continue their troop and weapons buildup unopposed', ""  Prelude ELNA expelled from Luanda

advantage of the situation to begin airlifting ELNA troops into Luanda from their training camps in neighbouring Zaire', ' With each movement extending its influence over the local population, the uneasy peace soon broke down and within a month the capital had erupted into bloody street battles', "" On 3 January 1975, at the behest of Organisation of African Unity, Neto, Roberto, and UNITA's Savimbi signed an accord in which they agreed to a permanent truce and promised to terminate mutually hostile propaganda"", ' The nationalists then participated in a multi-party conference in Alvor, Portugal, which formed a coalition government of MPLA, FNLA, UNITA, and Portuguese representatives to govern Angola during the interim period', ' The coalition government would draft a constitution, to be followed by democratic elections', "" Angola's independence date was set for 11 November 1975, the four hundredth anniversary of the founding of Luanda"", ""  Fighting almost immediately broke out in Luanda again when Neto took advantage of the ceasefire to launch a purge of Chipenda's supporters"", ' The Chipenda faction was largely annihilated, leaving ELNA as the only remaining obstacle to FAPLA control of the city', ' Chipenda and 2,000 of his surviving troops defected to ELNA around February, which further heightened tensions', "" ELNA had the largest number of personnel inside Angola at the time, and was further strengthened by over 400 tonnes of weaponry donated by the People's Republic of China and channelled through a sympathetic Zaire"", ' ELNA also benefited from covert financial aid supplied by the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)', "" Roberto was pressed by his field commanders to destroy Neto's forces while he held an indisputable advantage in manpower and logistics over his opponent"", ' On 23 March, ELNA began attacking FAPLA bases in Luanda', ' A week later, a motorised column of 500 ELNA troops drove into the capital to join the fighting, unopposed by the Portuguese troops on duty', "" The threat posed by ELNA's troop buildup was proving far more formidable than Neto had anticipated, and near the end of March he appealed to the Soviet Union and Cuba for military backing"", '  As an ELNA victory in Luanda had become more apparent, Soviet policymakers grew increasingly anxious about Angola', "" They believed that Angola's fate carried heavy implications for the global strategic and diplomatic momentum gained by the Soviet sphere after the end of the Vietnam War"", ' They saw Roberto as an agent of Bakongo tribalism rather than a true revolutionary and assumed that his success would serve the interests of Beijing and Washington', ' The coincidence of Chinese and American patronage of Roberto was especially alarming, as it seemed to indicate the possibility of a future Sino-American alliance dominating Angola, to the detriment of Soviet interests', "" The result was approval of Neto's request for a massive increase in Soviet military aid to FAPLA"", ' During March 1975 alone, Soviet pilots flew thirty planeloads of weapons into Brazzaville, where they were unloaded and transported by rail, truck, and ship to waiting FAPLA units around Luanda', "" In the span of three months, the Soviet Union had airlifted thirty million dollars' worth of weaponry to FAPLA"", ' Neto had received enough new arms to equip an additional 20,000 troops, and this proved instrumental in turning the tide against Roberto', ' Additionally, a Soviet military delegation offered to provide training instructors and logistics staff during well-publicised talks with the MPLA leadership on 25 April', ' For its part, Cuba deployed a contingent of 230 military advisers and technicians to Angola to assemble Soviet hardware and train an influx of new FAPLA recruits', ' The first Cuban advisers began arriving in May', '  The infusion of Soviet arms helped fuel increasingly heavier confrontations in Luanda and provided the raw material for a major conventional FAPLA counteroffensive', ' In late May FAPLA violated a short-lived ceasefire by attacking and defeating several ELNA garrisons in the Cuanza Norte, Malanje, and Uíge provinces', ' Buoyed by these victories, the MPLA Politburo authorised a counteroffensive with the objective of isolating and destroying ELNA in Luanda', ' Between 3 June and 5 June, FAPLA eliminated the ELNA presence in the Cabinda exclave', ' The Portuguese succeeded in imposing a ceasefire on 7 June, but this was short-lived: the ELNA units stationed in Luanda had been sapped by the fighting in late May and the FAPLA general staff, detecting weakness, was eager to finish them off', "" On 9 July, FAPLA and the MPLA's popular militia resumed their counteroffensive, bringing the full weight of their Soviet-supplied weapons, including mortars and T-34-85 tanks, to bear against the lightly armed ELNA infantry"", ' After several days of street battles, FAPLA was in full possession of Luanda, having driven ELNA out of the capital and its outlying suburbs', ' ELNA released a press statement accusing Cuban advisers of having played a major role in the FAPLA counteroffensive', ' Placing emphasis on the fact that FAPLA had violated the most recent ceasefire, Roberto announced he was no longer prepared to negotiate peace with Neto', ' The MPLA responded that it would likewise no longer negotiate peace and would pursue the war until the FNLA and ELNA were permanently defeated', '  Zaire and South Africa intervene  Following its expulsion from Luanda, ELNA withdrew to the nearby port of Ambriz, where it established its new military headquarters and began planning a counteroffensive on Luanda', ' Roberto, who had hitherto directed the war effort from Kinshasa, immediately made preparations to return to Angola and manage all ELNA operations personally', ' He claimed he would capture Luanda before Angolan independence', ' For the time being,

ammunition, and training', ' South African military advisers under Commandant Jan Breytenbach subsequently entered Angola to begin providing basic training and technical instruction on the weapons provided', "" South Africa's decision to throw aid behind ELNA and FALA marked the first definitive step toward its own deep embroilment in the Angolan war, the beginning of a series of escalations which would lead to the commitment of regular ground forces on 23 October"", ""  Of all ELNA's external benefactors, Roberto looked optimistically to his personal ally, Zairean president Mobutu Sese

ELNA with thousands of obsolete rifles from its own reserve stocks, as well as Panhard AML armoured cars which were airlifted directly to Ambriz', ' Zairean army regulars—two battalions of paratroops, numbering about 1,200 men—began crossing into Angola on 18 May', ' Neto complained that Angola was being subject to a ""silent invasion by soldiers from Zaire"", prompting the Portuguese to lodge an official protest with Mobutu at the end of May', '  Emboldened by arms deliveries and commitments of additional support, Roberto ordered his troops to seize the strategic crossroads town of Caxito,

it announced that Caxito as well as the highway leading south towards Luanda would be renamed in honour of Roberto', ' However, within a week ELNA advances south of Caxito had been checked by stiff FAPLA resistance', ' On 30 August, ELNA resumed its offensive and progressed as far as Quifangondo before being halted again by FAPLA', ' FAPLA launched a counteroffensive with its conventional 9th

inexperienced', ' A sizeable majority were recent recruits enrolled with little training; few had been under hostile fire', ' Also in the ELNA force were 120 veterans of the Portuguese Army who

transferred to ELNA, and they were supplied without crews or tank transporters to move them', ' The tanks arrived too late to be used in the fighting at Quifangondo', ' At the beginning of November, the only comparable armour ELNA possessed were nine antiquated Panhard AML-60 and AML-90 armoured cars, all of which were in decrepit condition due to age and poor maintenance', ' It also had at least one Panhard M3 VTT armoured personnel carrier, likely one of several abandoned in Angola by the withdrawing Portuguese', '  The ELNA infantry was equipped with a miscellaneous array of Western, Chinese, and Soviet small arms', ' The increased flow of foreign material and financial aid beginning in August had done little to improve this situation due to logistics woes and corruption in the Zairean Armed Forces, which had diverted the most modern CIA-supplied weapons bound for ELNA to its own arsenals', "" The small arms ELNA did receive intact from the CIA and Zaire were all obsolete or approaching obsolescence, and hopelessly outclassed by FAPLA's sophisticated Soviet weaponry"", ' For fire support, ELNA had six 120 mm mortars of American origin', ' These had been part of a larger

the bulk of the FAPLA garrison was made of new recruits evacuated from a training camp in Vila Salazar', ' In late October, FAPLA had closed the camp and abandoned Vila Salazar to refocus on defending Luanda', ' The Vila Salazar recruits were hastily thrown into battle during the unsuccessful attack on Morro do Cal, and had been driven back to Quifangondo by a combined ELNA-Zairean force along with

Soviet Union donated another 10 T-34-85s to FAPLA, promising to have them delivered to Luanda before 10 November', ' While not very formidable from a conventional standpoint, the presence of the

the ELNA troops to withdraw', ' On 8 November, ELNA and Zairean troops made a second attempt to approach the village, but were again subject to withering artillery fire and forced to abandon their advance', ' These experiences had the effect of persuading Roberto he needed more guns of his own to suppress the FAPLA battery', "" South Africa's subsequent delivery of three medium guns and

endorsed a withdrawal from the Quifangondo front in favour of a broad encircling movement from the east"", ' Roberto rejected their counsel', ' This was his last chance to destroy FAPLA before Angolan independence was bestowed; furthermore, he thought it desirable to strike before FAPLA was further strengthened by its Cuban and Soviet allies', '  The South Africans reluctantly resigned themselves to supporting the attack, gambling on the likelihood that if their guns could drive the defenders underground into their bunkers, then an immediate and well-coordinated infantry assault might break through', '  Colonel e Castro, who supported a direct frontal assault on Quifangondo, was responsible for most of the operational planning for the attack', ' However, some of the other Portuguese volunteers were more skeptical', ' The dissenters insisted that Roberto should consider a flanking movement through the swamps as his main avenue of approach', ' Alternatively, flanking attacks could be made through the swamps to support the main advance along the highway', ' This option had already been discussed between Roberto and his South African advisers and rejected for several reasons: the swampy terrain east of the highway was impassable to the wheeled vehicles, possessed inadequate cover to bestow an advantage in concealment, and the ELNA infantry had flatly refused to cross it on

AO-2015-7#-00000388,"[""The Battle of Cassinga also known as the Cassinga Raid or Kassinga Massacre was a controversial South African airborne attack on a South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) military camp at the town of Cassinga, Angola on 4 May 1978"", "" Conducted as one of the three major actions of Operation Reindeer during the South African Border War, it was the South African Army's first major air assault operation"", '  Despite investigations with evidence to the contrary such as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), claims continue that Cassinga was a refugee camp, rather than a military camp, and that consequently the raid was a massacre of civilians rather than a military operation', ""  While there are extensive records covering the SADF's planning and actions around the operation (declassified since the change of government in 1994), no SWAPO records other than photographic evidence of the mass grave exist"", '  Background  Starting in 1976, SWAPO PLAN combatants regularly travelled south by road from Huambo through Cassinga, an abandoned Angolan mining town that was located about halfway to the battlefront at the Namibian border', ' The town had about twenty buildings that previously served the local iron-ore mine as warehouses, accommodation and offices', '  A group of PLAN guerrillas led by Dimo Hamaambo occupied Cassinga some weeks after they began using it as a stopover point; according to both Charles ""Ho Chi Minh"" Namoloh and Mwetufa ""Cabral"" Mupopiwa, who accompanied Hamaambo when the village was first occupied, the first Namibian inhabitants of Cassinga consisted entirely of trained PLAN combatants', '  Not long after the establishment of the PLAN camp at Cassinga, it began to function also as a transit camp for Namibian exiles', '  The Angolan government allocated the abandoned village to SWAPO in 1976 to cope with the influx of thousands of refugees from South West Africa, estimated in May 1978 to total 3,000 to 4,000 people', '  Two days before the South African raid, UNICEF reported of a ""well-run and well-organized"" camp but ""ill-equipped"" to cope with the rapid refugee increase in early 1978', ' The Cubans, who set up a base at nearby Techamutete when they intervened in the war in 1975, provided logistical support to the SWAPO administration at Cassinga', '  \t\t  According to SADF intelligence, ""Logistic planning and the provision of supplies, weapons and ammunition to insurgents operating in central and eastern Ovamboland were undertaken from Cassinga"", which they learned from PLAN POWs was codenamed ""Moscow""', '  Medical treatment of the seriously wounded as well as the repair of equipment and the assembly of newly trained insurgents on their way to bases in the East and West Cunene Provinces all took place in Cassinga', '""  South African planning  By the beginning of 1978 SWAPO had improved its organisation and gained strength in Owambo and the Eastern Caprivi, UNITA was under pressure from the MPLA, and it became increasingly difficult for the SADF to operate in Southern Angola', ' South Africa also feared the disruption of elections it planned to hold in South West Africa excluding SWAPO', '  The attack on Cassinga grew out of the plan for Operation Bruilof, wherein the SADF envisaged attacking six SWAPO targets around the town of Chetequera', "" During the intelligence-gathering portion of the planning for Operation Bruilof, the SADF concluded that the small town of Cassinga was the principal medical, training and control centre for the guerrillas in the region, and one of SWAPO's two regional HQ's (the other being further north at Lubango)"", '  The SAAF still held air superiority over Angola at the time, allowing 12 Squadron to conduct aerial photo-reconnaissance with Canberra B12s in spring of 1978', ""  These photos showed newly built military infrastructure including concreted 'drive-in' bunkers for armoured fighting vehicles covering approach roads, zigzag trenches surrounding the base, foxholes for machine guns/mortar crews – and the highly characteristic 'star-shaped' concreted base structure for a SAM-3 missile battery and its radar/command vehicle"", ' Also identifiable from the imagery was a civilian single-decker bus', '   PLAN combatants at Cassinga were aware of the overflights, and in a letter dated 10 April 1978, the camp\'s commander Hamaambo expressed concerns to his superiors about an ""imminent invasion intention of our enemy of our camp in Southern Angola""', '  In response to the reconnaissance flights, defenses were improved through the creation of a secondary camp north of the main camp, the addition of more trenches and the digging of holes for the protection of food provisions', '  The SADF shelved the plan for Operation Bruilof and planning for a new operation, Operation Reindeer, began', ' Reindeer was composed of three main actions; the airborne assault on Cassinga, a mechanised assault on the Chetaquera complex at  – that also involved SAAF defence-suppression strikes – and an assault on the Dombondola complex at  by a light infantry force', '  The planners for the operation were faced with a significant problem', ' While the Chetequera and Dombondola complexes were only around 35\xa0km from the border with South West Africa/Namibia (then under South African control), therefore making conventional assault possible, Cassinga was 260\xa0km from the border and deep inside Angola', "" This meant that any conventional assault force would have to fight its way in and out, and would almost certainly have given advance warning to the PLAN (People's Liberation Army of Namibia – SWAPO's armed wing) soldiers in Cassinga, allowing them and leaders like Jerobeum 'Dimo' Amaambo (the PLAN commander-in-chief, then resident in Cassinga) and Greenwell Matongo to escape"", ' Cassinga furthermore was located on a small hill, flanked by a river on its West side, and open fields in other directions, factors that combined to give any defenders the advantage', ""  However, South African Defence Force (SADF) intelligence reports had ascertained that SWAPO – and probably its advisers – was lulled into a false sense of security because of Cassinga's distance from the Namibian border to the south"", ' South African military intelligence briefings before the event indicated no awareness of any nearby supportive infantry or armoured units to support the base against a ground assault, and although SWAPO had been constructing a system of integrated defensive trenches and firing points for wheeled/tracked AFVs and AAA units, they were not then prepared for a joint-arms airborne attack', '  The SADF had not previously demonstrated any such capability, giving military analysts no reason to suspect that such an option was available to the SADF planners', '  The planners therefore believed that they could conduct a surprise attack on the base using only a lightly-armed airborne force', ' Earlier in that year, SAAF 12 Squadron had commenced training for a low-level strike role, utilising anti-personnel weapons such as cluster bombs', '  The South Africans knew about the success of Operation Eland and Operation Dingo, pre-emptive raids conducted in the previous two years by the Rhodesian Selous Scouts against guerilla forces based in Mozambique, and modeled their raid on many of the same principles', '  Though a risky plan it was decided that the element of surprise would outweigh the disadvantage of not having supporting armour on the ground', '  The SADF decided to mount a large airborne assault on Cassinga (by now code-named ""Alpha""), supported by South African Air Force (SAAF) fighter-bombers and a fleet of 17 medium-transport helicopters', ' Using an exercise already underway called Exercise Kwiksilver as a cover story, the army initiated a call up of the Citizen Force (reserve units similar to the US National Guard) parachute units', ' The paratroopers conducted refresher training at the base of 1 Parachute Battalion (1 Bn) in Bloemfontein and then field training in the area surrounding the derelict Rheinholdtskop farm on the De Brug Training Area', '  A top secret document prepared by General Magnus Malan for the then Minister of Defence, P', ' W', ' Botha, refers to Cassinga as ""a large SWAPO base located 260\xa0km north of the border', 'The border referred to here is the Namibian–Angolan border', ' It is the operational military headquarters of SWAPO from where all operations against SWA are planned and their execution co-ordinated', ' From this base all supplies and armaments are provided to the bases further forward', '  Here training also takes place', '  In short, it is probably the most important SWAPO base in Angola', '  The nearest Cuban base is 15\xa0km South of Alpha', '""  The South African cabinet was hesitant to authorise the operation, fearing an international backlash, but on 2 May 1978 the Prime Minister, John Vorster, finally approved the operation', '  The date of 4 May was specifically chosen as it was after the United Nations Security Council debate on South West Africa ended so as to ""avoid making lives difficult for those countries favourable to South Africa""', '  Composition of forces  South Africa right|300px|thumb|Airborne forces committed to the battle Because of the secrecy involved in the operation, and the commitment of most of the professional ""permanent force"" troops and ""national servicemen"" conscripts of 1 Bn in other operations, it was decided to use 2 and 3 Parachute Battalions (2 Bn & 3 Bn), both reserve or ""Citizen Force"" units, in the operation', ' However, the need for secrecy meant not enough Citizen Force soldiers could be called up to fill both Parachute Battalions', ' As a result, all three were temporarily merged into a single composite Parachute Battalion, which was commanded by Colonel Jan Breytenbach', ' The final composition of forces for the attack on Cassinga was therefore the following:   The entire operation was run by Major General Ian Gleeson, who commanded the SWA Tactical HQ (set up specially for Operation Reindeer)', '   Overall control of the airborne forces was given to Brigadier M', 'J', ' du Plessis, who commanded the Parachute Brigade HQ', ' The units under his command were the Composite Parachute Battalion under Colonel Breytenbach that was composed of A, B, C and D companies (all under-strength), an independent rifle platoon, a mortar platoon and an anti-tank platoon;   The Helicopter Administration Area (HAA) protection force under Major James Hills, consisting of two Hawk Groups (10-man sections of rapid-reaction paratroopers) from 1 Bn;   An Airborne Reserve under Captain Wesley de Beer, consisting of a company from 2 Bn airborne in a C', '160 to be used in the event of reinforcements being required, and the Mobile Air Operations Team (MAOT) under Commandant James Kriel, which consisted of five SAAF personnel to set up and run the HAA', ' All the paratroopers were equipped with a folding stock version of the R1 7', '62\xa0mm assault rifle', '  The South African Air Force contribution consisted of four C-130 Hercules and five C', '160 Transall transport aircraft', ' The helicopter component of the operation consisted of 13 Pumas and six Super Frelons', '  The air attack component provided by the SAAF consisted of four Canberra B-12 bombers, each carrying 300 Alpha anti-personnel bombs; five Buccaneers carrying eight  bombs each, as well as a sixth carrying seventy-two 68\xa0mm rockets, and lastly four Mirage III fighter aircraft, armed only with Sidewinder air-to-air missiles and their 30\xa0mm cannons fitted with high-explosive fragmentation shells', '  One crew from the Canberra squadron was tasked with acquiring further photo-reconnaissance imagery, some to be used in the preparation of photo-strip maps for the Tactical Low Flying (TLF) legs that the various aircraft types would undertake – there being inadequate conventional mapping of much of the region – and additional and up-to-date detailed imagery of the Cassinga environs for the Parabat drop zone and Buccaneer target planning purposes', ' Particular attention was paid to identifying units of AAA deployed in/near the target complex', ' It was during this phase that a serious error was made, with potentially disastrous consequences', '  Air-photo interpreters put the wrong scale on some of the maps that were used in the planning, despite the altimeter readings being clearly visible in the original reconnaissance photographs', "" Consequently, the air force planners overestimated the size of the DZ, believing it was long and wide enough to drop the paratroopers, when in fact it wasn't"", "" This 'scale error' also mispositioned the 'Warning' and 'Drop' points on the run-in to drop"", "" Compounding this error, the pilot of the lead aircraft was momentarily distracted by the effects of the bombing, and issued the 'jump' signal a few seconds late"", ' The net effect was that many paratroopers overshot their intended DZs, many landing beyond the river – and some in it', '  Playing a supporting role was a single Cessna C-185, which flew in the target area and acted as an observation post as well as a radio relay aircraft', ' In addition there was a single DC-4 Strikemaster fitted out as an EW and ELINT aircraft flying over the SWA/Namibia border with Angola', ' The purpose of this latter aircraft was to both intercept all Angolan, Cuban and SWAPO radio transmissions, before jamming their communications networks at the appropriate time', ' The successful jamming of the SWAPO, Angolan and Cuban communications network is one of the reasons for the late reaction by either of the latter two in responding to the attack', '  PLAN PLAN, the armed wing of SWAPO, was a guerrilla army and therefore did not have a traditional command and control structure', ' As such, it is impossible to determine a composition of units inside Cassinga', ' According to TRC findings, a self-defence unit posted at Cassinga consisted of approximately 300 male and female PLAN cadres (other source: approximately 300 to 600)', ' The military section of Cassinga was easily partitioned from the non-military sections', ' The overall commander of PLAN in town was Dimo Amaambo, who responsible for the co-ordination of all PLAN actions in Southern Angola, including incursions into South West Africa/Namibia', ' A headquarters such as Cassinga was second in importance only to Lubango, which was the overall SWAPO military headquarters in Angola', ' Aside from the system of trenches and bunkers, defensive equipment included two ZPU-4 14', '5\xa0mm anti-aircraft guns, one ZU-23-2 23\xa0mm gun, and around one or two ZSU 12', '7\xa0mm guns', ' These were capable of being used in a ground attack role', '  Cuba The nearest Cuban military presence was 15\xa0km south of Cassinga, at the village of Techamutete, located at ', ' It consisted of a reinforced mechanised battalion of at least four T-34 tanks, 17 BTR-152 armoured personnel carriers, seven trucks and four anti-aircraft guns, accompanied by around 400 troops', ' This unit was known to SADF intelligence, who had intercepted their radio traffic, and were also aware of their anti-UNITA operations', ' Their strength was estimated at 144 in October 1977, and was a major contributing factor in the choice of air rather than a ground assault', "" In briefing the strike aircrew, the SAAF Chief of Staff Intelligence was specific that there was no known military formation within 80 miles, except for a detachment of 'African police' with one truck"", "" In debriefs, when questioned by commanders and aircrew of the 2 strike components, Canberras and Buccaneers, he insisted that the Cuban formation being just some 15\xa0km to the south at Tetchamutete was 'a complete surprise and must have been deployed there in recent days'"", ' Certainly, no photo reconnaissance over that village/road junction was ordered, but could easily have been included in the later Canberra PR overflights of Cassinga', '  Attack  04h00 – 09h00  Air movements thumb|right|SAAF Canberra bomber The first to move on the morning of the attack were the paratroopers of the Composite Para Bn, who got up at 04h00 and began fitting their weapons, equipment and parachutes', '  At 05h19, the four Buccaneers bombers took off from AFB Waterkloof, followed at 05h43 by the faster Canberra', "" The heavily laden 'Buccs' could fly only at medium altitude, so their true airspeed (TAS) was considerably lower than that of the 'Cans', flying over  higher"", ' One of the Buccaneers went to an air force base nearer to the Angolan border in order to refuel and act as a close air support (CAS) aircraft, while the fifth aircraft of the Buccaneer strike force was delayed due to a brake problem, leaving four Buccaneers available for the initial strike', '  At 06h00 the eight transport aircraft carrying the paratroopers became airborne', ' Two of the Transall C-160s, carrying the reserve company of 116 paratroopers, peeled off and entered a holding pattern just south of the border so as to be available to drop reinforcements during the battle', ' The remaining six transports continued on towards a holding point some miles east of Cassinga', '  At about 06h30, the ELINT/EW Douglas DC-4 became airborne and settled into a holding pattern just south of the border', "" At the same time, a flight of two Puma helicopters, under the command of Major John Church, took off from 'a jungle night-stop' to fly to a clearing 22\xa0km east of Cassinga in order to set up a Helicopter Administration Area (HAA), where the helicopters used in the operation could refuel"", "" On board the two helicopters were Commandant James Kriel, the commander of the South African Air Force's Mobile Air Operations Team (MAOT) and his signaller, as well as Major James Hills, commander of Bravo Company, 1 Bn, along with one ten-man section from the two Hawk Groups he would be using to protect the HAA"", ' Also in the two helicopters were six 200-litre drums of helicopter fuel, and, to the consternation of Hills, the Chief of the South African Army, Lieutenant-General Constand Viljoen', '  The MAOT set up their radios and navigational beacons at the HAA, by now code-named Whisky-Three, and signalled the all-clear for the rest of the force, consisting of the rest of the Hawk Group protection element (31 paratroopers), six medical personnel, two more members of the MAOT and eighty-six 200-litre drums of helicopter fuel, all on board a fleet of five Super Frelon and ten Puma helicopters', ' The HAA was then completed, and the 17 helicopters refuelled and waited for the call to extract the paratroopers after the completion of the attack', '  Also at around 07h00 the solitary Cessna C-185 took off and began flying towards Cassinga', ' Its role in the operation was to be an airborne observation post, giving the all-clear for the paratrooper drop, as well as being a radio-relay aircraft (known as ""Telstar duty"" in the SAAF)', ' It would later be forced to withdraw due to sustained anti-aircraft fire', ' At around 07h50 two Mirage III fighter aircraft took off, heading straight for Cassinga', '  Bombing runs The defence-suppression bombing attack by the Canberras was two minutes late, occurring at 08h02 instead of 08h00 as originally planned, because the lead navigator failing to maintain effective timing-adjustment during the  low-level approach phase', ' This made no difference to the intended effect', "" As the bombing had been timed to coincide with SWAPO's daily roll call on the parade ground, most of the people in the camp were assembled in the open when the Canberras initiated their low-level fragmentation bomb attack from the north"", ' Each of the four Canberras – flying in loose \'line abreast\' at  and 300 knots – dropped 300 Rhodesian-designed ""Alpha"" fragmentation bombs, which were small  finless bombs like \'10-Pin Bowling\' balls, designed to bounce up to  into the air before detonating', "" A zone of some 800 metres by 500 metres was carpeted, each aircraft having its own 'bomb line'"", ' The weapons were devastatingly effective against the assembled groupings below, causing most of SWAPO\'s casualties on the day, and also destroying vehicles, POL (""Petroleum Oil Lubricants"", military acronym for flammable liquids) storage tanks and soft buildings', '  Immediately after the Canberras came the Buccaneers, from the west, who flew their dive-bombing runs along a generally east–west axis', ' Photography from the cockpit of one of the aircraft showed the graphic lines of the preceding ""Alpha"" bomb strikes, was released to the SA press the following day', "" Of the total of thirty-two 1000\xa0lb (450\xa0kg) conventional bombs dropped by the four Buccaneers on the identified 'hard points', 24 scored direct hits, causing an immense amount of damage"", ' Finally, the two Mirage IIIs conducted a strafing run on the target, using their 30\xa0mm DEFA cannons', ' All the aircraft except for the solitary Buccaneer on CAS duty then flew back to air bases in South West Africa (Namibia) to refuel and re-arm to provide close air support if required – the Mirages to Ondangwa air force base, the Canberras, Buccaneers and C-130/C-160s to Grootfontein air force base, where their support teams and material had been ferried up from Pretoria during the morning', ' The Canberras and Buccaneers were used for a later strike on the Chetequera complex', '  Parachute drop After the attack aircraft had finished their bombing runs the six transports, which had been holding in wait to the east, commenced their formation run towards Cassinga at an altitude of 200 feet (60 m)', ' Shortly before reaching the base, the six aircraft climbed to , the drop height, and lined up for the drop', "" However, required visual 'tracking and distance' co-ordination markers were obscured by smoke from the bombing run, the drop zone (DZ) box scaling and drop point distances were incorrect – due to the reconnaissance scaling errors – and the drop was a shambles with nearly all the paratroopers being dropped off-target, some on the West side of the river and some into tall maize where they had problems linking up"", "" The resultant confusion caused numerous delays, ruining the schedule of the 'drop-to-contact' plan, and much of the advantage of surprise"", ' The disastrous drop also meant that it would be nearly an hour before C-Company was able to move into position on the eastern side of the camp and seal off the escape routes and as a result a number of top PLAN commanders, including Dimo Amaambo and Greenwell Matongo (two principal targets of the attack) escaped (with Amaambo later becoming the first head of the Namibian Defence Force in 1990)', '  The two independent rifle platoons, No', '9 and No', '11, were dropped quite accurately to the north', ' They immediately went into action, moving through a tented camp to the north-west of Cassinga, beyond the bombed areas', ' Resistance was fierce but short-lived, and a total of 54 bodies were counted by the platoons before they took up their position along the northern end of the base to seal off that escape route', '  Of the four main paratrooper companies, D-Company had experienced the most accurate drop, though they were still 500 m from their intended drop zone', ' Regrouping quickly, they moved to attack structures which had been identified in the aerial reconnaissance photos as engineering buildings', ' However, during the assault on these buildings several of them exploded, perhaps due to ammunition stores within, injuring several paratroopers', ' There was also a brief blue-on-blue engagement as D-Company paratroopers were mistakenly fired upon by their fellow soldiers from B-Company, which by then had reached the base, but there were no casualties', ' After completing the assault of the engineer complex, D-Company moved south to set up a stop-line and prevent any guerrillas from escaping via that route', ' It also dispatched the anti-tank platoon to lay a tank ambush on the road to Techamutete', '  09h00 – 12h00 By 09h00, A and B Companies had regrouped and were ready to commence the main assault on Cassinga', ' Instead of attacking eastwards as initially planned, the two companies attacked the base in a northerly direction', ' Initially, they encountered very little resistance, though this changed dramatically once the paratroopers neared the centre of the base', ' Heavy sniper fire was directed at the paratroopers from a number of trees inside the base, they were subjected to B-10 recoilless rifle fire, and some SWAPO guerrillas had regrouped, using houses as cover from which to fire at the paratroopers, critically wounding two paratroopers', '  thumb|ZPU-2 anti-aircraft gun However, the paratroopers faced their greatest challenge when they were fired upon by a number of ZPU-2 14', '5\u2009mm multi-barrel anti-aircraft guns used in the ground role', ' This brought both companies to a complete halt, as they were unable to move under the accurate, and close, fire of the guns, and the Buccaneer on CAS duty could not conduct a strike on the guns for fear of hitting the paratroopers close by', '  In the end, Colonel Breytenbach ordered the commander of D-Company to take some men and work up towards the guns by attacking the trenches to the west of Cassinga', ' He also ordered the mortar platoon to begin attacking the guns', '  Upon entering the trenches, the men from D-Company were surprised to find a number of civilians, whom they later asserted were being used as human shields by the guerrillas hiding inside', '  The guerrillas opened fire on the paratroopers, leading the paratroopers to enter what they described later as a mode of ""kill or be killed"", in which preventing the deaths of the civilians in the trenches was allegedly impossible', "" Though a number of civilians were killed in those trenches, as the paratroopers moved forward encountered less and less civilians until nearer the guns all those in the trenches, male and female, were wearing SWAPO's Cuban-style uniforms"", ' In the meantime, 9 Platoon had entered the trenches from the north, though were making slow progress as they came under the attention of the gunners', '  After a combination of the attack through the trenches and the mortar fire, the guns were silenced', ' The toll was an acceptable one for the South Africans; there were at least 95 SWAPO fighters dead inside the trenches and around the guns', ' Three paratroopers had been killed', '  After the fall of the guns, all major resistance in Cassinga ended', ' The odd sniper and corners of light resistance were all that remained, and the mopping up process was soon finished', ' The paratroopers immediately set up the Bn HQ and Regimental Aid-Post (RAP) next to the SWAPO hospital, and began treating the worst of the injured', ' Overall, three paratroopers had been killed, and eleven wounded, two of them critically', ' In addition, a fourth paratrooper was found to be missing, presumed killed', ' It was later assumed that he had drowned after being dropped in the river during the parachute jump, or that his parachute had malfunctioned', '  By now the attack was two hours behind schedule, with the first helicopter extractions having been planned for 10h00', '  12h00 – 15h00 Brigadier Du Plessis at this time informed Colonel Breytenbach of a radio interception, indicating that the Cuban force at Techamutete was deploying', '  The SADF had been given explicit operational instructions to avoid conflict with the Cubans, but delays on the part of SADF now made that a distinct possibility', ' Brigadier Du Plessis insisted on extracting all the troops immediately, however Colonel Breytenbach wanted to secure the LZ first', ' A compromise was agreed whereby half the paratroopers would move to the LZ where 12 Puma helicopters would extract them, while the remainder would continue clearing operations, as well as to collect any and all documents of intelligence value', '  At around 13h00, Colonel Breytenbach was informed by one of the Buccaneers on CAS duty that the Cuban mechanised battalion was moving up the road from Techamutete to Cassinga', '  The Buccaneer had spotted an advancing column of around 30 assorted AFVs, APCs, T-34 tanks and other vehicles advancing slowly up the road from Techamutete', ' It immediately opened fire on the column, destroying three BTR-152 armoured personnel carriers in the process, but then had to return to Grootfontein air force base to re-arm and refuel, leaving about 200 of the remaining paratroopers temporarily unprotected', ' All that stood between them and the advancing armoured column were the 22 men of the anti-tank platoon, armed only with 10 RPG-7 rocket launchers and five anti-tank mines which they had planted in the road', ""  At this time however, there was a serious breakdown in the South Africans' command and control, and a number of fundamental errors were made"", ' The shuttle of helicopters to and from Whiskey-Three, the HAA, as well as the order in which paratroopers were embarked, was improvised and initially uncoordinated and disorganised', "" It wasn't made initially clear to the commander of the helicopter extraction force quite what the problem – and the sudden urgency – was"", ' Furthermore, two engineers, whose role was to destroy enemy equipment, departed in the first wave with all the demolition fuses before all the equipment had been disabled', '  Meanwhile, the Cuban column advanced directly into the ambush that the paratroopers had set for them', '  The lead T-34 tank was destroyed by one of the anti-tank mines, while the paratroopers destroyed four of the BTR-152s using their RPG-7s', "" They also killed approximately 40 of the Cuban troops before making their 'fighting retreat' back along the road towards the Helicopter Landing Zone (HLZ) east of Cassinga where Breytenbach was organising the remaining paratroopers for final extraction"", ' In the face of the oncoming armoured column, Breytenbach ordered a thin defensive line, but realised the lightly armed paratroopers stood little chance against the armoured vehicles and prepared to fall-back into the bush to an emergency LZ while calling urgently for air support', '  The initial success of the SADF assault now looked like turning into a disaster with the imminent prospect of being overrun by Cuban armoured forces,  into enemy territory', ' General Viljoen, who until this time had been wearing his rank and beret, removed and hid them', '  At 14h20, when the Cuban AFVs were already in sight of the beleaguered paratroopers, a Buccaneer and two Mirage IIIs arrived overhead', ' An experienced Forward Air Controller (FAC) amongst the paratroopers began to direct the three aircraft in strikes against the advancing Cuban armour', ' The Mirage IIIs, with their 30\xa0mm cannons, destroyed 10 BTR-152s before running low on fuel and returning to Ondangwa air force base', "" The Mirages' cannons were unable to destroy any tanks, but the sole Buccaneer destroyed at least two tanks, an anti-aircraft position and a number of other vehicles with its 68\xa0mm SNEB air-to-ground rockets"", ' The rockets had been omitted from the original Operation Order, but the Buccaneer Squadron Commander had fortuitously chosen to include them in the ordnance that was ferried to the Grootfontein forward air force base by C-130 Hercules, with his ground crews and maintenance spares', ' The Buccaneer pilot was being fired on continually by a towed 14', '5\xa0mm anti-aircraft gun, at which he had to make two passes before he was able to destroy it with rockets', '  The Buccaneer ran out of ammunition at this point, but this coincided with the arrival of the 17 helicopters to extract the remaining paratroopers in the second wave', "" The helicopters' arrival betrayed the position of the LZ to the remaining Cuban forces, who began to advance on the area"", ' While unable to see the armoured vehicles, the paratroopers could hear their engines and gunfire, and could see trees being flattened in their path barely  away', "" In a desperate attempt to prevent the Cuban tanks from firing at the vulnerable helicopters and the assembling SA troops waiting to be picked up, the Buccaneer pilot dived his aircraft dangerously low, nearly hitting trees as he flew close over the top of the tanks in mock attacks, disorienting the crews and forcing them to break off their developing attack on the Parabats' positions"", ' There were several holes in the airframe, including one on the armoured front visor glass, needing swift patching by groundcrew after landing, refuelling and re-arming', '  Because of the disorganisation with the first wave of helicopters, there was nearly not enough space for all the remaining paratroopers and prisoners on the second wave', ' In the ensuing chaos and panic to scramble aboard the helicopters, 40\xa0SWAPO prisoners, intended to be taken back to South West Africa for interrogation, had to be released to lighten the aircraft', ' Some excess equipment and ammunition was also dumped from the overloaded helicopters', ' A final barrage of fire from the paratroopers stalled the closing Cuban armour just sufficiently long enough to complete the extraction of the assembled paratroops', '  However ten minutes after taking off, two of the Puma helicopters were directed to return to Cassinga, as it was feared that some of the paratroopers might have been left behind', ' They spotted a group of people huddled together, but closer inspection revealed that they were the prisoners who had been left behind', ' The helicopters flew a total of four low passes looking for paratroopers, when one of the helicopter pilots spotted a Cuban tank appearing from the bushes', ' He warned the other Puma pilot, who was able to bank away just in time so that the tank round missed the aircraft', ' No paratroopers were found and the two Pumas returned to the HAA', ' The dismantling of the HAA continued throughout the rest of the day', '  15h00 – 18h00 At 15h00, one of the Mirage IIIs returned to Cassinga, and once again strafed the Cuban vehicles that were still on the road, setting at least one of them alight', ' It was replaced at 15h30 by another aircraft and a Buccaneer which proceeded to destroy more of the vehicles and a building', ' About a kilometre south of Cassinga, the Buccaneer attacked another column of vehicles, coming under heavy anti-aircraft fire in the process', '  Another Buccaneer arrived at 16h45, surprised some Cubans moving through the ruins and destroyed a T-34 tank and some anti-aircraft guns in the process, while further Mirage and Buccaneer strikes at 17h10 and 18h35 destroyed another tank and other equipment', ""  The result was that by nightfall nearly the entire Cuban battalion had been destroyed, killing around 150 Cuban soldiers, accounting for that country's biggest single-day casualty rate during its military involvement in Angola"", '  A complete Angolan tank brigade relief force, arriving at dusk, was too late to have any impact and found only scenes of destruction at what had once been Cassinga', '  Aftermath According to an Angolan government white paper, the official toll of the Cassinga Raid was a total of 624 dead and 611 injured civilians as well as combatants', ' Among the dead were 167 women and 298 teenagers and children', ' Since many of the combatants were female or teenagers and many combatants did not wear uniforms, the exact number of civilians among the dead could not be established', '  A secret report to the SWAPO Central Committee listed 582 dead and 400 wounded', '  The South Africans declared the attack on Cassinga to be a great military success, even though disaster was so closely averted by the intervention of the SAAF, and in the face of a SWAPO propaganda campaign that labelled the event a massacre', '  Despite inflicting heavy casualties, the SADF did not kill or capture Dimo Amaambo or any other senior SWAPO leaders', '  The SADF casualties were low for such an attack, an important factor in South Africa where the public was intolerant of high casualty rates: Three soldiers were killed, one was missing in action presumed dead (landed in river, failed to emerge), and eleven were wounded', '  According to General Constand Viljoen, Cassinga set the strategy for the SADF for the next ten years, i', 'e', ' that of launching pre-emptive strikes at SWAPO inside Angola, even though subsequent actions would be armoured rather than air assaults', '  SWAPO launched Operation Revenge, a retaliatory bombardment of Katima Mulilo in the Caprivi Strip on 23 August 1978, during which 10 soldiers were killed and 10 injured as a result of a direct hit on their barracks by an 82\xa0mm mortar bomb', '  Sixteen guerrillas were killed in a SADF follow-up operation  into Zambia', '

regime', ' A media campaign had been carefully prepared well in advance of the operation and media releases managed in order to create an impression that SADF intervention was at the request of the SWA administration, and to counter negative reports on South African military actions and claims of killing innocent civilians', ' This campaign included the fabrication and distortion of SWAPO actions', ' One of the parachute battalions was specifically tasked to take photographs and instructed to focus on images supporting the South African cause; bodies were only to be photographed with weapons by their side', ' Negative images, such as suffering victims, were to be avoided', ' Nevertheless, in spite of these instructions, pictures of bodies without weapons and of dead SADF paratroopers were taken', 'SADF photographs by Mike McWilliams included pictures of bodies without weapons, and pictures of dead SADF paratroopers', '  The Angolans were first to publish details of the attack, followed shortly thereafter by SWAPO press statements that supported and elaborated on the Angolan account', '  They described the base as a refugee camp and claimed the SADF had slaughtered 600 defenceless refugees', ' The bodies were buried in two mass graves at Cassinga; pictures of one of the mass graves was used extensively for propaganda purposes, and for many people therefore became the imagery that they associated with the event', '  The debate over whether Cassinga was a military camp or a refugee camp (or both) continues to rage', '  Weapons and military installations were present and documented at the camp', ' In 1998 the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission also concluded that  The United Nations invited SWAPO-leader Sam Nujoma to address the council before issuing United Nations Security Council Resolution 428 on 6 May condemning South Africa for ""the armed invasion of Angola carried out on 4 May 1978""', ' The Council condemned apartheid and the continued occupation of Southwest Africa and commended Angola for its support of the Namibian people', '  After independence, the new government of Namibia declared 4 May as ""Cassinga Day"", a public holiday to commemorate the loss of life during the raid', ' In 2007, the names of the Cuban soldiers who were killed were carved into the wall of Freedom Park in South

destroyed by FAPLA and its Cuban allies', '  Background  Since the late fifteenth century, Portugal had administered Angola as part of a vast African empire which included Mozambique and Portuguese Guinea (modern day Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau)', ' Following the loss of Brazil and the erosion of its influence in the Americas during the early nineteenth century, Portugal increasingly refocused

southern Angola, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) was formed by Jonas Savimbi and drew its recruits from Ovimbundu farm labourers and itinerant peasants', ' A third movement, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), was formed by the Angolan Communist Party and targeted the embryonic upper working class of public sector workers in Luanda', ' Most of its senior leaders, namely Agostinho Neto, were professionals and intellectuals educated in European universities', ' It was in this educated elite that the combination of anti-colonial resentment and exposure to international political theory came to be most articulated; for example, the MPLA invested heavily in lobbying campaigns overseas which won it support and recognition among political leaders in Africa and the Middle East', ' Its use of Marxist political language and open criticism of the United States in particular proved effective at winning support with the Soviet Union and leftist governments elsewhere', ""  thumb|left|FNLA leader Holden Roberto All three movements quickly formed militant wings to coordinate their insurgent campaigns against the Portuguese: the FNLA

(FAPLA)"", ' The creation of three separate insurgent armies provoked internecine strife which doomed any attempt to present a united front against the Portuguese and limited their effectiveness on the battlefield', ' Until the formation of the militant wings, disputes between the movements had been largely confined to political theory', ' However, beginning in late 1961 there were a number of clashes between ELNA and FAPLA that became central to the rivalry between the FNLA and MPLA, and evolved into outright hostility', ' It was not uncommon for ELNA to intercept and kill FAPLA personnel who strayed into its area of operations', ' Hamstrung by violent divisions, the insurgents aggravated the colonial administration but did not threaten its control of the territory', ""  In late April 1974, Portugal's authoritarian Estado Novo government was toppled by the Carnation Revolution, which sounded the death knell for that country's pretensions as a colonial empire"", ' Angolan nationalists perceived the political upheaval in Lisbon as an opportunity to upend the colonial order; the MPLA, FNLA, and UNITA rejected ceasefire requests and all demanded the Portuguese affirm an unconditional right to independence', ' General António de Spínola, head of the Portuguese provisional government, was initially in favour of retaining the colonies as semi-autonomous federal subjects, but found little support for this measure in the progressive atmosphere which dominated local politics after the revolution', ' On 27 July 1974, he bowed to pressure and announced that the colonies were to be granted independence, unconditionally', '  By November 1974 the authority and morale of the Portuguese security forces in Angola had been seriously undermined; meanwhile, the three nationalist movements were attempting to exploit the developing power vacuum by amassing troops and stockpiling arms', "" The nationalists' political and military wings rushed to establish authority on the ground, moving rapidly to take over key towns left unguarded by the withdrawing Portuguese"", ' Massive shipments of foreign arms from their various allies made the movements increasingly more lethal as tensions grew', ' The insurgents also seized large quantities of Portuguese weapons from the arsenals of disbanding colonial units', ' As long as their administrative structures were not

advantage of the situation to begin airlifting ELNA troops into Luanda from their training camps in neighbouring Zaire', ' With each movement extending its influence over the local population, the uneasy peace soon broke down and within a month the capital had erupted into bloody street battles', "" On 3 January 1975, at the behest of Organisation of African Unity, Neto, Roberto, and UNITA's

and fled after the first rocket salvo', ' Others sought cover in the swampy terrain adjacent to the road', ' At length the defenders also began to shell the demoralised infantry column with mortars',

its crew', ' The South African guns remained operational, but they lacked the range to neutralise the Grad-Ps and could not match their rate of fire', ' A member of one of the artillery crews was wounded by a shell fragment; he was the only South African casualty at Quifangondo', '  Accounts on the volume of FAPLA artillery fire and the degree to which Cuban BM-21s may have participated in the battle remain contradictory', ' John Stockwell estimated that ""two thousand rockets rained on the task force as it broke and fled in panic', '"" Stockwell also claimed that truck-mounted BM-21s played an active role during the battle at Quifangondo, enabling their crews to quickly displace whenever they came under counter-battery fire from the South African guns', ' Monteiro was adamant that

AO-2015-7#-00000388,"[""The Battle of Cassinga also known as the Cassinga Raid or Kassinga Massacre was a controversial South African airborne attack on a South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) military camp at the town of Cassinga, Angola on 4 May 1978"", "" Conducted as one of the three major actions of Operation Reindeer during the South African Border War, it was the South African Army's first major air assault operation"", '  Despite investigations with evidence to the contrary such as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), claims continue that Cassinga was a refugee camp, rather than a military camp, and that consequently the raid was a massacre of civilians rather than a military operation', ""  While there are extensive records covering the SADF's planning and actions around the operation (declassified since the change of government in 1994), no SWAPO records other than photographic evidence of the mass grave exist"", '  Background  Starting in 1976, SWAPO PLAN combatants regularly travelled south by road from Huambo through Cassinga, an abandoned Angolan mining town that was located about halfway to the battlefront at the Namibian border', ' The town had about twenty buildings that previously served the local iron-ore mine as warehouses, accommodation and offices', '  A group of PLAN guerrillas led by Dimo Hamaambo occupied Cassinga some weeks after they began using it as a stopover point; according to both Charles ""Ho Chi Minh"" Namoloh and Mwetufa ""Cabral"" Mupopiwa, who accompanied Hamaambo when the village was first occupied, the first Namibian inhabitants of Cassinga consisted entirely of trained PLAN combatants', '  Not long after the establishment of the PLAN camp at Cassinga, it began to function also as a transit camp for Namibian exiles', '  The Angolan government allocated the abandoned village to SWAPO in 1976 to cope with the influx of thousands of refugees from South West Africa, estimated in May 1978 to total 3,000 to 4,000 people', '  Two days before the South African raid, UNICEF reported of a ""well-run and well-organized"" camp but ""ill-equipped"" to cope with the rapid refugee increase in early 1978', ' The Cubans, who set up a base at nearby Techamutete when they intervened in the war in 1975, provided logistical support to the SWAPO administration at Cassinga', '  \t\t  According to SADF intelligence, ""Logistic planning and the provision of supplies, weapons and ammunition to insurgents operating in central and eastern Ovamboland were undertaken from Cassinga"", which they learned from PLAN POWs was codenamed ""Moscow""', '  Medical treatment of the seriously wounded as well as the repair of equipment and the assembly of newly trained insurgents on their way to bases in the East and West Cunene Provinces all took place in Cassinga', '""  South African planning  By the beginning of 1978 SWAPO had improved its organisation and gained strength in Owambo and the Eastern Caprivi, UNITA was under pressure from the MPLA, and it became increasingly difficult for the SADF to operate in Southern Angola', ' South Africa also feared the disruption of elections it planned to hold in South West Africa excluding SWAPO', '  The attack on Cassinga grew out of the plan for Operation Bruilof, wherein the SADF envisaged attacking six SWAPO targets around the town of Chetequera', "" During the intelligence-gathering portion of the planning for Operation Bruilof, the SADF concluded that the small town of Cassinga was the principal medical, training and control centre for the guerrillas in the region, and one of SWAPO's two regional HQ's (the other being further north at Lubango)"", '  The SAAF still held air superiority over Angola at the time, allowing 12 Squadron to conduct aerial photo-reconnaissance with Canberra B12s in spring of 1978', ""  These photos showed newly built military infrastructure including concreted 'drive-in' bunkers for armoured fighting vehicles covering approach roads, zigzag trenches surrounding the base, foxholes for machine guns/mortar crews – and the highly characteristic 'star-shaped' concreted base structure for a SAM-3 missile battery and its radar/command vehicle"", ' Also identifiable from the imagery was a civilian single-decker bus', '   PLAN combatants at Cassinga were aware of the overflights, and in a letter dated 10 April 1978, the camp\'s commander Hamaambo expressed concerns to his superiors about an ""imminent invasion intention of our enemy of our camp in Southern Angola""', '  In response to the reconnaissance flights, defenses were improved through the creation of a secondary camp north of the main camp, the addition of more trenches and the digging of holes for the protection of food provisions', '  The SADF shelved the plan for Operation Bruilof and planning for a new operation, Operation Reindeer, began', ' Reindeer was composed of three main actions; the airborne assault on Cassinga, a mechanised assault on the Chetaquera complex at  – that also involved SAAF defence-suppression strikes – and an assault on the Dombondola complex at  by a light infantry force', '  The planners for the operation were faced with a significant problem', ' While the Chetequera and Dombondola complexes were only around 35\xa0km from the border with South West Africa/Namibia (then under South African control), therefore making conventional assault possible, Cassinga was 260\xa0km from the border and deep inside Angola', "" This meant that any conventional assault force would have to fight its way in and out, and would almost certainly have given advance warning to the PLAN (People's Liberation Army of Namibia – SWAPO's armed wing) soldiers in Cassinga, allowing them and leaders like Jerobeum 'Dimo' Amaambo (the PLAN commander-in-chief, then resident in Cassinga) and Greenwell Matongo to escape"", ' Cassinga furthermore was located on a small hill, flanked by a river on its West side, and open fields in other directions, factors that combined to give any defenders the advantage', ""  However, South African Defence Force (SADF) intelligence reports had ascertained that SWAPO – and probably its advisers – was lulled into a false sense of security because of Cassinga's distance from the Namibian border to the south"", ' South African military intelligence briefings before the event indicated no awareness of any nearby supportive infantry or armoured units to support the base against a ground assault, and although SWAPO had been constructing a system of integrated defensive trenches and firing points for wheeled/tracked AFVs and AAA units, they were not then prepared for a joint-arms airborne attack', '  The SADF had not previously demonstrated any such capability, giving military analysts no reason to suspect that such an option was available to the SADF planners', '  The planners therefore believed that they could conduct a surprise attack on the base using only a lightly-armed airborne force', ' Earlier in that year, SAAF 12 Squadron had commenced training for a low-level strike role, utilising anti-personnel weapons such as cluster bombs', '  The South Africans knew about the success of Operation Eland and Operation Dingo, pre-emptive raids conducted in the previous two years by the Rhodesian Selous Scouts against guerilla forces based in Mozambique, and modeled their raid on many of the same principles', '  Though a risky plan it was decided that the element of surprise would outweigh the disadvantage of not having supporting armour on the ground', '  The SADF decided to mount a large airborne assault on Cassinga (by now code-named ""Alpha""), supported by South African Air Force (SAAF) fighter-bombers and a fleet of 17 medium-transport helicopters', ' Using an exercise already underway called Exercise Kwiksilver as a cover story, the army initiated a call up of the Citizen Force (reserve units similar to the US National Guard) parachute units', ' The paratroopers conducted refresher training at the base of 1 Parachute Battalion (1 Bn) in Bloemfontein and then field training in the area surrounding the derelict Rheinholdtskop farm on the De Brug Training Area', '  A top secret document prepared by General Magnus Malan for the then Minister of Defence, P', ' W', ' Botha, refers to Cassinga as ""a large SWAPO base located 260\xa0km north of the border', 'The border referred to here is the Namibian–Angolan border', ' It is the operational military headquarters of SWAPO from where all operations against SWA are planned and their execution co-ordinated', ' From this base all supplies and armaments are provided to the bases further forward', '  Here training also takes place', '  In short, it is probably the most important SWAPO base in Angola', '  The nearest Cuban base is 15\xa0km South of Alpha', '""  The South African cabinet was hesitant to authorise the operation, fearing an international backlash, but on 2 May 1978 the Prime Minister, John Vorster, finally approved the operation', '  The date of 4 May was specifically chosen as it was after the United Nations Security Council debate on South West Africa ended so as to ""avoid making lives difficult for those countries favourable to South Africa""', '  Composition of forces  South Africa right|300px|thumb|Airborne forces committed to the battle Because of the secrecy involved in the operation, and the commitment of most of the professional ""permanent force"" troops and ""national servicemen"" conscripts of 1 Bn in other operations, it was decided to use 2 and 3 Parachute Battalions (2 Bn & 3 Bn), both reserve or ""Citizen Force"" units, in the operation', ' However, the need for secrecy meant not enough Citizen Force soldiers could be called up to fill both Parachute Battalions', ' As a result, all three were temporarily merged into a single composite Parachute Battalion, which was commanded by Colonel Jan Breytenbach', ' The final composition of forces for the attack on Cassinga was therefore the following:   The entire operation was run by Major General Ian Gleeson, who commanded the SWA Tactical HQ (set up specially for Operation Reindeer)', '   Overall control of the airborne forces was given to Brigadier M', 'J', ' du Plessis, who commanded the Parachute Brigade HQ', ' The units under his command were the Composite Parachute Battalion under Colonel Breytenbach that was composed of A, B, C and D companies (all under-strength), an independent rifle platoon, a mortar platoon and an anti-tank platoon;   The Helicopter Administration Area (HAA) protection force under Major James Hills, consisting of two Hawk Groups (10-man sections of rapid-reaction paratroopers) from 1 Bn;   An Airborne Reserve under Captain Wesley de Beer, consisting of a company from 2 Bn airborne in a C', '160 to be used in the event of reinforcements being required, and the Mobile Air Operations Team (MAOT) under Commandant James Kriel, which consisted of five SAAF personnel to set up and run the HAA', ' All the paratroopers were equipped with a folding stock version of the R1 7', '62\xa0mm assault rifle', '  The South African Air Force contribution consisted of four C-130 Hercules and five C', '160 Transall transport aircraft', ' The helicopter component of the operation consisted of 13 Pumas and six Super Frelons', '  The air attack component provided by the SAAF consisted of four Canberra B-12 bombers, each carrying 300 Alpha anti-personnel bombs; five Buccaneers carrying eight  bombs each, as well as a sixth carrying seventy-two 68\xa0mm rockets, and lastly four Mirage III fighter aircraft, armed only with Sidewinder air-to-air missiles and their 30\xa0mm cannons fitted with high-explosive fragmentation shells', '  One crew from the Canberra squadron was tasked with acquiring further photo-reconnaissance imagery, some to be used in the preparation of photo-strip maps for the Tactical Low Flying (TLF) legs that the various aircraft types would undertake – there being inadequate conventional mapping of much of the region – and additional and up-to-date detailed imagery of the Cassinga environs for the Parabat drop zone and Buccaneer target planning purposes', ' Particular attention was paid to identifying units of AAA deployed in/near the target complex', ' It was during this phase that a serious error was made, with potentially disastrous consequences', '  Air-photo interpreters put the wrong scale on some of the maps that were used in the planning, despite the altimeter readings being clearly visible in the original reconnaissance photographs', "" Consequently, the air force planners overestimated the size of the DZ, believing it was long and wide enough to drop the paratroopers, when in fact it wasn't"", "" This 'scale error' also mispositioned the 'Warning' and 'Drop' points on the run-in to drop"", "" Compounding this error, the pilot of the lead aircraft was momentarily distracted by the effects of the bombing, and issued the 'jump' signal a few seconds late"", ' The net effect was that many paratroopers overshot their intended DZs, many landing beyond the river – and some in it', '  Playing a supporting role was a single Cessna C-185, which flew in the target area and acted as an observation post as well as a radio relay aircraft', ' In addition there was a single DC-4 Strikemaster fitted out as an EW and ELINT aircraft flying over the SWA/Namibia border with Angola', ' The purpose of this latter aircraft was to both intercept all Angolan, Cuban and SWAPO radio transmissions, before jamming their communications networks at the appropriate time', ' The successful jamming of the SWAPO, Angolan and Cuban communications network is one of the reasons for the late reaction by either of the latter two in responding to the attack', '  PLAN PLAN, the armed wing of SWAPO, was a guerrilla army and therefore did not have a traditional command and control structure', ' As such, it is impossible to determine a composition of units inside Cassinga', ' According to TRC findings, a self-defence unit posted at Cassinga consisted of approximately 300 male and female PLAN cadres (other source: approximately 300 to 600)', ' The military section of Cassinga was easily partitioned from the non-military sections', ' The overall commander of PLAN in town was Dimo Amaambo, who responsible for the co-ordination of all PLAN actions in Southern Angola, including incursions into South West Africa/Namibia', ' A headquarters such as Cassinga was second in importance only to Lubango, which was the overall SWAPO military headquarters in Angola', ' Aside from the system of trenches and bunkers, defensive equipment included two ZPU-4

aware of their anti-UNITA operations', ' Their strength was estimated at 144 in October 1977, and was a major contributing factor in the choice of air rather than a ground assault', "" In briefing the strike aircrew, the SAAF Chief of Staff Intelligence was specific that there was no known military formation within 80 miles, except for a detachment of 'African police' with one truck"", "" In debriefs, when questioned by commanders and aircrew of the 2 strike components, Canberras and Buccaneers, he insisted that the Cuban formation being just some 15\xa0km to the south at Tetchamutete was 'a complete surprise and must have been deployed there in recent days'"", ' Certainly, no photo reconnaissance over that village/road junction was ordered, but could easily have been included in the later Canberra PR overflights of Cassinga', '  Attack  04h00 – 09h00  Air movements thumb|right|SAAF Canberra bomber The first to move on the morning of the attack were the paratroopers of the

Puma helicopters', ' The HAA was then completed, and the 17 helicopters refuelled and waited for the call to extract the paratroopers after the completion of the attack', '  Also at around 07h00 the solitary Cessna C-185 took off and began flying towards Cassinga', ' Its role in the operation was to be an airborne observation post, giving the all-clear for the paratrooper drop, as well as being a radio-relay aircraft (known as ""Telstar duty"" in the SAAF)', ' It would later be forced to withdraw due to sustained anti-aircraft fire', ' At around 07h50 two Mirage III fighter aircraft took off, heading straight for Cassinga', '  Bombing runs The defence-suppression bombing attack by the Canberras was two minutes late, occurring at 08h02 instead of 08h00 as originally planned, because the lead navigator failing to maintain effective timing-adjustment during the  low-level approach phase', ' This made no difference to the intended effect', "" As the bombing had been timed to coincide with SWAPO's daily roll call on the parade ground, most of the people in the camp were assembled in the open when the Canberras initiated their low-level fragmentation bomb attack from the north"", ' Each of the four Canberras – flying in loose \'line abreast\' at  and 300 knots – dropped 300 Rhodesian-designed ""Alpha"" fragmentation bombs, which were small  finless bombs like \'10-Pin Bowling\' balls, designed to bounce up to  into the air before detonating', "" A zone of some 800 metres by 500 metres was carpeted, each aircraft having its own 'bomb line'"", ' The weapons were devastatingly effective against the assembled groupings below, causing most of SWAPO\'s casualties on the day, and also destroying vehicles, POL (""Petroleum Oil Lubricants"", military acronym for flammable liquids) storage tanks and soft buildings', '  Immediately after the Canberras came the Buccaneers, from the west, who flew their dive-bombing runs along a generally east–west axis', ' Photography from the cockpit of one of the aircraft showed the graphic lines of the preceding ""Alpha"" bomb strikes, was released to the SA press the following day', "" Of the total of thirty-two 1000\xa0lb (450\xa0kg) conventional bombs dropped by the four Buccaneers on the identified 'hard points', 24 scored direct hits, causing an immense amount of damage"", ' Finally, the two Mirage IIIs conducted a strafing run on the target, using their 30\xa0mm DEFA cannons', ' All the aircraft except for the solitary Buccaneer on CAS duty then flew back to air bases in South West Africa (Namibia) to refuel and re-arm to provide close air support if required – the Mirages to Ondangwa air force base, the Canberras, Buccaneers and C-130/C-160s to Grootfontein air force base, where their support teams and material had been ferried up from Pretoria during the morning', ' The Canberras and Buccaneers were used for a later strike on the Chetequera complex', '  Parachute drop After the attack aircraft had finished their bombing runs the six transports, which had been holding in wait to the east, commenced their formation run towards Cassinga at an altitude of 200 feet (60 m)', ' Shortly before reaching the base, the six aircraft climbed to , the drop height, and lined up for the drop', "" However, required visual 'tracking and distance' co-ordination markers were obscured by smoke from the bombing run, the drop zone (DZ) box scaling and drop point distances were incorrect – due to the reconnaissance scaling errors – and the drop was a shambles with nearly all the paratroopers being dropped off-target, some on the West side of the river and some into tall maize where they had problems linking up"", "" The resultant confusion caused numerous delays, ruining the schedule of the 'drop-to-contact' plan, and much of the advantage of surprise"", ' The disastrous drop also meant that it would be nearly an hour before C-Company was able to move into position on the eastern side of the camp and seal off the escape routes and as a result a number of top PLAN commanders, including Dimo Amaambo and Greenwell Matongo (two principal targets of the attack) escaped (with Amaambo later becoming the first head of the Namibian Defence Force in 1990)', '  The two independent rifle platoons, No', '9 and No', '11, were dropped quite accurately to the north', ' They immediately went into action, moving through a tented camp to the north-west of Cassinga, beyond the bombed areas', ' Resistance was fierce but short-lived, and a total of 54 bodies were counted by the platoons before they took up their position along the northern end of the base to seal off that escape route', '  Of the four main paratrooper companies, D-Company had experienced the most accurate drop, though they were still 500 m from their intended drop zone', ' Regrouping quickly, they moved to attack structures which had been identified in the aerial reconnaissance photos as engineering buildings', ' However, during the assault on these buildings several of them exploded, perhaps due to ammunition stores within, injuring several paratroopers', ' There was also a brief blue-on-blue engagement as D-Company paratroopers were mistakenly fired upon by their fellow soldiers from B-Company, which by then had reached the base, but there were no casualties', ' After completing the assault of the engineer complex, D-Company moved south to set up a stop-line and prevent any guerrillas from escaping via that route', ' It also dispatched the anti-tank platoon to lay a tank ambush on the road to Techamutete', '  09h00 – 12h00 By 09h00, A and B Companies had regrouped and were ready to commence the main assault on Cassinga', ' Instead of attacking eastwards as initially planned, the two companies attacked the base in a northerly direction', ' Initially, they encountered very little resistance, though this changed dramatically once the paratroopers neared the centre of the base', ' Heavy sniper fire was directed at the paratroopers from a number of trees inside the base, they were subjected to B-10 recoilless rifle fire, and some SWAPO guerrillas had regrouped, using houses as cover from which to fire at the paratroopers, critically wounding two paratroopers', '  thumb|ZPU-2 anti-aircraft gun However, the paratroopers faced their greatest challenge when they were fired upon by a number of ZPU-2 14', '5\u2009mm multi-barrel anti-aircraft guns used in the ground role', ' This brought both companies to a complete halt, as they were unable to move under the accurate, and close, fire of the guns, and the Buccaneer on CAS duty could not conduct a strike on the guns for fear of hitting the paratroopers close by', '  In the end, Colonel Breytenbach ordered the commander of D-Company to take some men and work up towards the guns by attacking the trenches to the west of Cassinga', ' He also ordered the mortar platoon to begin attacking the guns', '  Upon entering the trenches, the men from D-Company were surprised to find a number of civilians, whom they later asserted were being used as human shields by the guerrillas hiding inside', '  The guerrillas opened fire on the paratroopers, leading the paratroopers to enter what they described later as a mode of ""kill or be killed"", in which preventing the deaths of the civilians in the trenches was allegedly impossible', "" Though a number of civilians were killed in those trenches, as the paratroopers moved forward encountered less and less civilians until nearer the guns all those in the trenches, male and female, were wearing SWAPO's Cuban-style uniforms"", ' In the meantime, 9 Platoon had entered the trenches from the north, though were making slow progress as they came under the attention of the gunners', '  After a combination of the attack through the trenches and the mortar fire, the guns were silenced', ' The toll was an acceptable one for the South Africans; there were at least 95 SWAPO fighters dead inside the trenches and around the guns', ' Three paratroopers had been killed', '  After the fall of the guns, all major resistance in Cassinga ended', ' The odd sniper and corners of light resistance were all that remained, and the mopping up process was soon finished', ' The paratroopers immediately set up the Bn HQ and Regimental Aid-Post (RAP) next to the SWAPO hospital, and began treating the worst of the injured', ' Overall, three paratroopers had been killed, and eleven wounded, two of them critically', ' In addition, a fourth paratrooper was found to be missing, presumed killed', ' It was later assumed that he had drowned after being dropped in the river during the parachute jump, or that his parachute had malfunctioned', '  By now the attack was two hours behind schedule, with the first helicopter extractions having been planned for 10h00', '  12h00 – 15h00 Brigadier Du Plessis at this time informed Colonel Breytenbach of a radio interception, indicating that the Cuban force at Techamutete was deploying', '  The SADF had been given explicit operational instructions to avoid conflict with the Cubans, but delays on the part of SADF now made that a distinct possibility', ' Brigadier Du Plessis insisted on extracting all the troops immediately, however Colonel Breytenbach wanted to secure the LZ first', ' A compromise was agreed whereby half the paratroopers would move to the LZ where 12 Puma helicopters would extract them, while the remainder would continue clearing operations, as well as to collect any and all documents of intelligence value', '  At around 13h00, Colonel Breytenbach was informed by one of the Buccaneers on CAS duty that the Cuban mechanised battalion was moving up the road from Techamutete to Cassinga', '  The Buccaneer had spotted an advancing column of around 30 assorted AFVs, APCs, T-34 tanks and other vehicles advancing slowly up the road from Techamutete', ' It immediately opened fire on the column, destroying three BTR-152 armoured personnel carriers in the process, but then had to return to Grootfontein air force base to re-arm and refuel, leaving about 200 of the remaining paratroopers temporarily unprotected', ' All that stood between them and the advancing armoured column were the 22 men of the anti-tank platoon, armed only with 10 RPG-7 rocket launchers and five anti-tank mines which they had planted in the road', ""  At this time however, there was a serious breakdown in the South Africans' command and control, and a number of fundamental errors were made"", ' The shuttle of helicopters to and from Whiskey-Three, the HAA, as well as the order in which paratroopers were embarked, was improvised and initially uncoordinated and disorganised', "" It wasn't made initially clear to the commander of the helicopter extraction force quite what the problem – and the sudden urgency – was"", ' Furthermore, two engineers, whose role was to destroy enemy equipment, departed in the first wave with all the demolition fuses before all the equipment had been disabled', '  Meanwhile, the Cuban column advanced directly into the ambush that the paratroopers had set for them', '  The lead T-34 tank was destroyed by one of the anti-tank mines, while the paratroopers destroyed four of the BTR-152s using their RPG-7s', "" They also killed approximately 40 of the Cuban troops before making their 'fighting retreat' back along the road towards the Helicopter Landing Zone (HLZ) east of Cassinga where Breytenbach was organising the remaining paratroopers for final extraction"", ' In the face of the oncoming armoured column, Breytenbach ordered a thin defensive line, but realised the lightly armed paratroopers stood little chance against the armoured vehicles and prepared to fall-back into the bush to an emergency LZ while calling urgently for air support', '  The initial success of the SADF assault now looked like turning into a disaster with the imminent prospect of being overrun by Cuban armoured forces,  into enemy territory', ' General Viljoen, who until this time had been wearing his rank and beret, removed and hid them', '  At 14h20, when the Cuban AFVs were already in sight of the beleaguered paratroopers, a Buccaneer and two Mirage IIIs arrived overhead', ' An experienced Forward Air Controller (FAC) amongst the paratroopers began to direct the three aircraft in strikes against the advancing Cuban armour', ' The Mirage IIIs, with their 30\xa0mm cannons, destroyed 10 BTR-152s before running low on fuel and returning to Ondangwa air force base', "" The Mirages' cannons were unable to destroy any tanks, but the sole Buccaneer destroyed at least two tanks, an anti-aircraft position and a number of other vehicles with its 68\xa0mm SNEB air-to-ground rockets"", ' The rockets had been omitted from the original Operation Order, but the Buccaneer Squadron Commander had fortuitously chosen to include them in the ordnance that was ferried to the Grootfontein forward air force base by C-130 Hercules, with his ground crews and maintenance spares', ' The Buccaneer pilot was being fired on continually by a towed 14', '5\xa0mm anti-aircraft gun, at which he had to make two passes before he was able to destroy it with rockets', '  The Buccaneer ran out of ammunition at this point, but this coincided with the arrival of the 17 helicopters to extract the remaining paratroopers in the second wave', "" The helicopters' arrival betrayed the position of the LZ to the remaining Cuban forces, who began to advance on the area"", ' While unable to see the armoured vehicles, the paratroopers could hear their engines and gunfire, and could see trees being flattened in their path barely  away', "" In a desperate attempt to prevent the Cuban tanks from firing at the vulnerable helicopters and the assembling SA troops waiting to be picked up, the Buccaneer pilot dived his aircraft dangerously low, nearly hitting trees as he flew close over the top of the tanks in mock attacks, disorienting the crews and forcing them to break off their developing attack on the Parabats' positions"", ' There were several holes in the airframe, including one on the armoured front visor glass, needing swift patching by groundcrew after landing, refuelling and re-arming', '  Because of the disorganisation with the first wave of helicopters, there was nearly not enough space for all the remaining paratroopers and prisoners on the second wave', ' In the ensuing chaos and panic to scramble aboard the helicopters, 40\xa0SWAPO prisoners, intended to be taken back to South West Africa for interrogation, had to be released to lighten the aircraft', ' Some excess equipment and ammunition was also dumped from the overloaded helicopters', ' A final barrage of fire from the paratroopers stalled the closing Cuban armour just sufficiently long enough to complete the extraction of the assembled paratroops', '  However ten minutes after taking off, two of the Puma helicopters were directed to return to Cassinga, as it was feared that some of the paratroopers might have been left behind', ' They spotted a group of people huddled together, but closer inspection revealed that they were the prisoners who had been left behind', ' The helicopters flew a total of four low passes looking for paratroopers, when one of the helicopter pilots spotted a Cuban tank appearing from the bushes', ' He warned the other Puma pilot, who was able to bank away just in time so that the tank round missed the aircraft', ' No paratroopers were found and the two Pumas returned to the HAA', ' The dismantling of the HAA continued throughout the rest of the day', '  15h00 – 18h00 At 15h00, one of the Mirage IIIs returned to Cassinga, and once again strafed the Cuban vehicles that were still on the road, setting at least one of them alight', ' It was replaced at 15h30 by another aircraft and a Buccaneer which proceeded to destroy more of the vehicles and a building', ' About a kilometre south of Cassinga, the Buccaneer attacked another column of vehicles, coming under heavy anti-aircraft fire in the process', '  Another Buccaneer arrived at 16h45, surprised some Cubans moving through the ruins and destroyed a T-34 tank and some anti-aircraft guns in the process, while further Mirage and Buccaneer strikes at 17h10 and 18h35 destroyed another tank and other equipment', ""  The result was that by nightfall nearly the entire Cuban battalion had been destroyed, killing around 150 Cuban soldiers, accounting for that country's biggest single-day casualty rate during its military involvement in Angola"", '  A complete Angolan tank brigade relief force, arriving at dusk, was too late to have any impact and found only scenes of destruction at what had once been Cassinga', '  Aftermath According to an Angolan government white paper, the official toll of the Cassinga Raid was a total of 624 dead and 611 injured civilians as well as combatants', ' Among the dead were 167 women and 298 teenagers and children', ' Since many of the combatants were female or teenagers and many combatants did not wear uniforms, the exact number of civilians among the dead could not be established', '  A secret report to the SWAPO Central Committee listed 582 dead and 400 wounded', '  The South Africans declared the attack on Cassinga to be a great military success, even though disaster was so closely averted by the intervention of the SAAF, and in the face of a SWAPO propaganda campaign that labelled the event a massacre', '  Despite inflicting heavy casualties, the SADF did not kill or capture Dimo Amaambo or any other senior SWAPO leaders', '  The SADF casualties were low for such an attack, an important factor in South Africa where the public was intolerant of high casualty rates: Three soldiers were killed, one was missing in action presumed dead (landed in river, failed to emerge), and eleven were wounded', '  According to General Constand Viljoen, Cassinga set the strategy for the SADF for the next ten years, i', 'e', ' that of launching pre-emptive strikes at SWAPO inside Angola, even though subsequent actions would be armoured rather than air assaults', '  SWAPO launched Operation Revenge, a retaliatory bombardment of Katima Mulilo in the Caprivi Strip on 23 August 1978, during which 10 soldiers were killed and 10 injured as a result of a direct hit on their barracks by an 82\xa0mm mortar bomb', '  Sixteen guerrillas were killed in a SADF follow-up operation  into Zambia', '  Political consequences thumb|One of the mass graves at Cassinga  According to General Geldenhuys the raid was a ""jewel of military craftmanship"", but politically it was a disaster for the apartheid regime', ' A media campaign had been carefully prepared well in advance of the operation and media releases managed in order to create an impression that SADF intervention was at the request of the SWA administration, and to counter negative reports on South African military actions and claims of killing innocent civilians', ' This campaign included the fabrication and distortion of SWAPO actions', ' One of the parachute battalions was specifically tasked to take photographs and instructed to focus on images supporting the South African cause; bodies were only to be photographed with weapons by their side', ' Negative images, such as suffering victims, were to be avoided', ' Nevertheless, in spite of these instructions, pictures of bodies without weapons and of dead SADF paratroopers were taken', 'SADF photographs by Mike McWilliams included pictures of bodies without weapons, and pictures of dead SADF paratroopers', '  The Angolans were first to publish details of the attack, followed shortly thereafter by SWAPO press statements that supported and elaborated on the Angolan account', '  They described the base as a refugee camp and claimed the SADF had slaughtered 600 defenceless refugees', ' The bodies were buried in two mass graves at Cassinga; pictures of one of the mass graves was used extensively for propaganda purposes, and for many people therefore became the imagery that they associated with the event', '  The debate over whether Cassinga was a military camp or a refugee camp (or both) continues to rage', '  Weapons and military installations were present and documented at the camp', ' In 1998 the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission also concluded that  The United Nations invited SWAPO-leader Sam Nujoma to address the council before issuing United Nations Security Council Resolution 428 on 6 May condemning South Africa for ""the armed invasion of Angola carried out on 4 May 1978""', ' The Council condemned apartheid and the continued occupation of Southwest Africa and commended Angola for its support of the Namibian people', '  After independence, the new government of Namibia declared 4 May as ""Cassinga Day"", a public holiday to commemorate the loss of life during the raid', ' In 2007, the names of the Cuban soldiers who were killed were carved into the wall of Freedom Park in South Africa', '  Official celebration of this event by the SANDF ended only in 1996, two years after Nelson Mandela was elected president', ' Veterans of the various South African parachute battalions

after the fighting', '  After defeating a FAPLA garrison at the nearby town of Caxito, an army of ELNA militants led personally by Holden Roberto began advancing southwards towards Luanda', ""

launchers"", ""  Following a poorly coordinated artillery bombardment and an ineffectual South African air strike, ELNA light and motorised infantry attacked the bridge early on the morning on 10 November, but became trapped in the open while crossing an elevated roadway and shelled by the defenders' rockets"", ' The ELNA advance stalled, and the attackers were unable to regain their initiative', ' Roberto committed his reserves, but by noon his entire force had been routed with heavy casualties and nearly all their vehicles destroyed', ' The ELNA forces broke into a disorderly retreat and could only be re-mustered that evening', ' Realising the battle was lost, the South African and Zairean troops withdrew to the nearby port of Ambriz and were later evacuated by their respective governments', '  While the battle was taking place, Portugal renounced its claims to Angolan sovereignty and withdrew the remainder of its colonial administrative and military personnel from Luanda', "" On the morning of 11 November, the MPLA proclaimed the People's Republic of Angola, which was immediately recognised by Cuba, the Soviet Union, Brazil, and several sympathetic African states"", ' ELNA had suffered such a catastrophic defeat at Quifangondo that Roberto was unable to launch another major offensive; over the next two months his forces were gradually scattered and destroyed by FAPLA and its Cuban allies', '  Background  Since the late fifteenth century, Portugal had administered Angola as part of a vast African empire which included Mozambique and Portuguese Guinea (modern day Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau)', ' Following the loss of Brazil and the erosion of its influence in the Americas during the early nineteenth century, Portugal increasingly refocused on the consolidation of its African colonies', "" As the largest, most developed, and most heavily populated colony in the Portuguese Empire, Angola came to replace Brazil as Lisbon's most valuable

late 1940s and 1950s delivered an unprecedented boost to nationalist confidence and ambitions, and in January 1961 the Angolan War of Independence broke out when radicalised peasants launched the Baixa de Cassanje revolt', ""  Between 1961 and 1964, three major nationalist movements rose to prominence in the fighting between the Portuguese security forces and local anti-colonial militants supported to varying degrees by the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and several newly independent African states"", ' The National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA) was led by Holden Roberto and recruited mostly from the Bakongo population of northern Angola and the Cabinda exclave, an area traditionally dominated by the Kingdom of Kongo', ' In the central highlands and southern Angola, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) was formed by Jonas Savimbi and drew its recruits from Ovimbundu farm labourers and itinerant peasants', ' A third movement, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), was formed by the Angolan Communist Party and targeted the embryonic upper working class of public sector workers in Luanda', ' Most of its senior leaders, namely Agostinho Neto, were professionals and intellectuals educated in European universities', ' It was in this educated elite that the combination of anti-colonial resentment and exposure to international political theory came to be most articulated; for example, the MPLA invested heavily in lobbying campaigns overseas which won it support and recognition among political leaders in Africa and the Middle East', ' Its use of Marxist political language and open criticism of the United States in particular proved effective at winning support with the Soviet Union and leftist governments elsewhere', ""  thumb|left|FNLA leader Holden Roberto All three movements quickly formed militant wings to coordinate their insurgent campaigns against the Portuguese: the FNLA formed the National Liberation Army of Angola (ELNA), UNITA formed the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FALA), and the MPLA formed the People's Armed Forces of Liberation of Angola (FAPLA)"", ' The creation of three separate insurgent armies provoked internecine strife which doomed any attempt to present a united front against the Portuguese and limited their effectiveness on the battlefield', ' Until the formation of the militant wings, disputes between the movements had been largely confined to political theory', ' However, beginning in late 1961 there were a number of clashes between ELNA and FAPLA that became central to the rivalry between the FNLA and MPLA, and evolved into outright hostility', ' It was not uncommon for ELNA to intercept and kill FAPLA personnel who strayed into its area of operations', ' Hamstrung by violent divisions, the insurgents aggravated the colonial administration but did not threaten its control of the territory', ""  In late April 1974, Portugal's authoritarian Estado Novo government was toppled by the Carnation Revolution, which sounded the death knell for that country's pretensions as a colonial empire"", ' Angolan nationalists perceived the political upheaval in Lisbon as an opportunity to upend the colonial order; the MPLA, FNLA, and UNITA rejected ceasefire requests and all demanded the Portuguese affirm an unconditional right to independence', ' General António de Spínola, head of the Portuguese provisional government, was initially in favour of retaining the colonies as semi-autonomous federal subjects, but found little support for this measure in the progressive atmosphere which dominated local politics after the revolution', ' On 27 July 1974, he bowed to pressure and announced that the colonies were to be granted independence, unconditionally', '  By November 1974 the authority and morale of the Portuguese security forces in Angola had been seriously undermined; meanwhile, the three nationalist movements were attempting to exploit the developing power vacuum by amassing troops and stockpiling arms', "" The nationalists' political and military wings rushed to establish authority on the ground, moving rapidly to take over key towns left unguarded by the withdrawing Portuguese"", ' Massive shipments of foreign arms from their various allies made the movements increasingly more lethal as tensions grew', ' The insurgents also seized large quantities of Portuguese weapons from the arsenals of disbanding colonial units', ' As long as their administrative structures were not attacked, the Portuguese made no attempt to enforce internal security, and the nationalists were able to continue their troop and weapons buildup unopposed', ""  Prelude ELNA expelled from Luanda

advantage of the situation to begin airlifting ELNA troops into Luanda from their training camps in neighbouring Zaire', ' With each movement extending its influence over the local population, the uneasy peace soon broke down and within a month the capital had erupted into bloody street battles', "" On 3 January 1975, at the behest of Organisation of African Unity, Neto, Roberto, and UNITA's

(ELNA), armed wing of the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA)"", ' The engagement was notable for marking the first major deployment of rocket artillery in the Angolan Civil War, as well as the last serious attempt by ELNA forces to seize Luanda, the Angolan capital', ' It occurred on the last day of Portuguese colonial rule in the country, which formally received independence only hours after the fighting', '  After defeating a FAPLA garrison at the nearby town of Caxito, an army of ELNA militants led personally by Holden Roberto began advancing southwards towards Luanda', ""

launchers"", ""  Following a poorly coordinated artillery bombardment and an ineffectual South African air strike, ELNA light and motorised infantry attacked the bridge early on the morning on 10

movement, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), was formed by the Angolan Communist Party and targeted the embryonic upper working class of public sector workers in Luanda', ' Most of its senior leaders, namely Agostinho Neto, were professionals and intellectuals educated in European universities', ' It was in this educated elite that the combination of anti-colonial resentment and exposure to international political theory came to be most articulated; for example, the MPLA invested heavily in lobbying campaigns overseas which won it support and recognition among political

to supporting the attack, gambling on the likelihood that if their guns could drive the defenders underground into their bunkers, then an immediate and well-coordinated infantry assault might break through', '  Colonel e Castro, who supported a direct frontal assault on Quifangondo, was responsible for most of the operational planning for the attack', ' However, some of the other Portuguese

be made through the swamps to support the main advance along the highway', ' This option had already been discussed between Roberto and his South African advisers and rejected for several reasons: the swampy terrain east of the highway was impassable to the wheeled vehicles, possessed inadequate cover to bestow an advantage in concealment, and the ELNA infantry had flatly refused to cross it on

African Army's first major air assault operation"", '  Despite investigations with evidence to the contrary such as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), claims continue that Cassinga was a refugee camp, rather than a military camp, and that consequently the raid was a massacre of civilians rather than a military operation', ""  While there are extensive records covering the SADF's planning and actions around the operation (declassified since the change of government in 1994), no SWAPO records other than photographic evidence of the mass grave exist"", '  Background  Starting in 1976, SWAPO PLAN combatants regularly travelled south by road from Huambo through Cassinga, an abandoned Angolan mining town that was located about halfway to the battlefront at the Namibian border', ' The town had about twenty buildings that previously served the local iron-ore mine as warehouses, accommodation and offices', '  A group of PLAN guerrillas led by Dimo Hamaambo occupied Cassinga some weeks after they began using it as a stopover point; according to both Charles ""Ho Chi Minh"" Namoloh and Mwetufa ""Cabral"" Mupopiwa, who accompanied Hamaambo when the village was first occupied, the first Namibian inhabitants of Cassinga consisted entirely of trained PLAN combatants', '  Not long after the establishment of the PLAN camp at Cassinga, it began to function also as a transit camp for Namibian exiles', '  The Angolan government allocated the abandoned village to SWAPO in 1976 to cope with the influx of thousands of refugees from South West Africa, estimated in May 1978 to total 3,000 to 4,000 people', '  Two days before the South African raid, UNICEF reported of a ""well-run and well-organized"" camp but ""ill-equipped"" to cope with the rapid refugee increase in early 1978', ' The Cubans, who set up a base at nearby Techamutete when they intervened in the war in 1975, provided logistical support to the SWAPO administration at Cassinga', '  \t\t  According to SADF intelligence, ""Logistic planning and the provision of supplies, weapons and ammunition to insurgents operating in central and eastern Ovamboland were undertaken from Cassinga"", which they learned from PLAN POWs was codenamed ""Moscow""', '  Medical treatment of the seriously wounded as well as the repair of equipment and the assembly of newly trained insurgents on their way to bases in the East and West Cunene Provinces all took place in Cassinga', '""  South African planning  By the beginning of 1978 SWAPO had improved its organisation and gained strength in Owambo and the Eastern Caprivi, UNITA was under pressure from the MPLA, and it became increasingly difficult for the SADF to operate in Southern Angola', ' South Africa also feared the disruption of elections it planned to hold in South West Africa excluding SWAPO', '  The attack on Cassinga grew out of the plan for Operation Bruilof, wherein the SADF envisaged attacking six SWAPO targets around the town of Chetequera', "" During the intelligence-gathering portion of the planning for Operation Bruilof, the SADF concluded that the small town of Cassinga was the principal medical, training and control centre for the guerrillas in the region, and one of SWAPO's two regional HQ's (the other being further north at Lubango)"", '  The SAAF still held air superiority over Angola at the time, allowing 12 Squadron to conduct aerial photo-reconnaissance with Canberra B12s in spring of 1978', ""  These photos showed newly built military infrastructure including concreted 'drive-in' bunkers for armoured fighting vehicles covering approach roads, zigzag trenches surrounding the base, foxholes for machine guns/mortar crews – and the highly characteristic 'star-shaped' concreted base structure for a SAM-3 missile battery and its radar/command vehicle"", ' Also identifiable from the imagery was a civilian single-decker bus', '   PLAN combatants at Cassinga were aware of the overflights, and in a letter dated 10 April 1978, the camp\'s commander Hamaambo expressed concerns to his superiors about an ""imminent invasion intention of our enemy of our camp in Southern Angola""', '  In response to the reconnaissance flights, defenses were improved through the creation of a secondary camp north of the main camp, the addition of more trenches and the digging of holes for the protection of food provisions', '  The SADF shelved the plan for Operation Bruilof and planning for a new operation, Operation Reindeer, began', ' Reindeer was composed of three main actions; the airborne assault on Cassinga, a mechanised assault on the Chetaquera complex at  – that also involved SAAF defence-suppression strikes – and an assault on the Dombondola complex at  by a light infantry force', '  The planners for the operation were faced with a significant problem', ' While the Chetequera and Dombondola complexes were only around 35\xa0km from the border with South West Africa/Namibia (then under South African control), therefore making conventional assault possible, Cassinga was 260\xa0km from the border and deep inside Angola', "" This meant that any conventional assault force would have to fight its way in and out, and would almost certainly have given advance warning to the PLAN (People's Liberation Army of Namibia – SWAPO's armed wing) soldiers in Cassinga, allowing them and leaders like Jerobeum 'Dimo' Amaambo (the PLAN commander-in-chief, then resident in Cassinga) and Greenwell Matongo to escape"", ' Cassinga furthermore was located on a small hill, flanked by a river on its West side, and open fields in other directions, factors that combined to give any defenders the advantage', ""  However, South African Defence Force (SADF) intelligence reports had ascertained that SWAPO – and probably its advisers – was lulled into a false sense of security because of Cassinga's distance from the Namibian border to the south"", ' South African military intelligence briefings before the event indicated no awareness of any nearby supportive infantry or armoured units to support the base against a ground assault, and although SWAPO had been constructing a system of integrated defensive trenches and firing points for wheeled/tracked AFVs and AAA units, they were not then prepared for a joint-arms airborne attack', '  The SADF had not previously demonstrated any such capability, giving military analysts no reason to suspect that such an option was available to the SADF planners', '  The planners therefore believed that they could conduct a surprise attack on the base using only a lightly-armed airborne force', ' Earlier in that year, SAAF 12 Squadron had commenced training for a low-level strike role, utilising anti-personnel weapons such as cluster bombs', '  The South Africans knew about the success of Operation Eland and Operation Dingo, pre-emptive raids conducted in the previous two years by the Rhodesian Selous Scouts against guerilla forces based in Mozambique, and modeled their raid on many of the same principles', '  Though a risky plan it was decided that the element of surprise would outweigh the disadvantage of not having supporting armour on the ground', '  The SADF decided to mount a large airborne assault on Cassinga (by now code-named ""Alpha""), supported by South African Air Force (SAAF) fighter-bombers and a fleet of 17 medium-transport helicopters', ' Using an exercise already underway called Exercise Kwiksilver as a cover story, the army initiated a call up of the Citizen Force (reserve units similar to the US National Guard) parachute units', ' The paratroopers conducted refresher training at the base of 1 Parachute Battalion (1 Bn) in Bloemfontein and then field training in the area surrounding the derelict Rheinholdtskop farm on the De Brug Training Area', '  A top secret document prepared by General Magnus Malan for the then Minister of Defence, P', ' W', ' Botha, refers to Cassinga as ""a large SWAPO base located 260\xa0km north of the border', 'The border referred to here is the Namibian–Angolan border', ' It is the operational military headquarters of SWAPO from where all operations against SWA are planned and their execution co-ordinated', ' From this base all supplies and armaments are provided to the bases further forward', '  Here training also takes place', '  In short, it is probably the most important SWAPO base in Angola', '  The nearest Cuban base is 15\xa0km South of Alpha', '""  The South African cabinet was hesitant to authorise the operation, fearing an international backlash, but on 2 May 1978 the Prime Minister, John Vorster, finally approved the operation', '  The date of 4 May was specifically chosen as it was after the United Nations Security Council debate on South West Africa ended so as to ""avoid making lives difficult for those countries favourable to South Africa""', '  Composition of forces  South Africa right|300px|thumb|Airborne forces committed to the battle Because of the secrecy involved in the operation, and the commitment of most of the professional ""permanent force"" troops and ""national servicemen"" conscripts of 1 Bn in other operations, it was decided to use 2 and 3 Parachute Battalions (2 Bn & 3 Bn), both reserve or ""Citizen Force"" units, in the operation', ' However, the need for secrecy meant not enough Citizen Force soldiers could be called up to fill both Parachute Battalions', ' As a result, all three were temporarily merged into a single composite Parachute Battalion, which was commanded by Colonel Jan Breytenbach', ' The final composition of forces for the attack on Cassinga was therefore the following:   The entire operation was run by Major General Ian Gleeson, who commanded the SWA Tactical HQ (set up specially for Operation Reindeer)', '   Overall control of the airborne forces was given to Brigadier M', 'J', ' du Plessis, who commanded the Parachute Brigade HQ', ' The units under his command were the Composite Parachute Battalion under Colonel Breytenbach that was composed of A, B, C and D companies (all under-strength), an independent rifle platoon, a mortar platoon and an anti-tank platoon;   The Helicopter Administration Area (HAA) protection force under Major James Hills, consisting of two Hawk Groups (10-man sections of rapid-reaction paratroopers) from 1 Bn;   An Airborne Reserve under Captain Wesley de Beer, consisting of a company from 2 Bn airborne in a C', '160 to be used in the event of reinforcements being required, and the Mobile Air Operations Team (MAOT) under Commandant James Kriel, which consisted of five SAAF personnel to set up and run the HAA', ' All the paratroopers were equipped with a folding stock version of the R1 7', '62\xa0mm assault rifle', '  The South African Air Force contribution consisted of four C-130 Hercules and five C', '160 Transall transport aircraft', ' The helicopter component of the operation consisted of 13 Pumas and six Super Frelons', '  The air attack component provided by the SAAF consisted of four Canberra B-12 bombers, each carrying 300 Alpha anti-personnel bombs; five Buccaneers carrying eight  bombs each, as well as a sixth carrying seventy-two 68\xa0mm rockets, and lastly four Mirage III fighter aircraft, armed only with Sidewinder air-to-air missiles and their 30\xa0mm cannons fitted with high-explosive fragmentation shells', '  One crew from the Canberra squadron was tasked with acquiring further photo-reconnaissance imagery, some to be used in the preparation of photo-strip maps for the Tactical Low Flying (TLF) legs that the various aircraft types would undertake – there being inadequate conventional mapping of much of the region – and additional and up-to-date detailed imagery of the Cassinga environs for the Parabat drop zone and Buccaneer target planning purposes', ' Particular attention was paid to identifying units of AAA deployed in/near the target complex', ' It was during this phase that a serious error was made, with potentially disastrous consequences', '  Air-photo interpreters put the wrong scale on some of the maps that were used in the planning, despite the altimeter readings being clearly visible in the original reconnaissance photographs', "" Consequently, the air force planners overestimated the size of the DZ, believing it was long and wide enough to drop the paratroopers, when in fact it wasn't"", "" This 'scale error' also mispositioned the 'Warning' and 'Drop' points on the run-in to drop"", "" Compounding this error, the pilot of the lead aircraft was momentarily distracted by the effects of the bombing, and issued the 'jump' signal a few seconds late"", ' The net effect was that many paratroopers overshot their intended DZs, many landing beyond the river – and some in it', '  Playing a supporting role was a single Cessna C-185, which flew in the target area and acted as an observation post as well as a radio relay aircraft', ' In addition there was a single DC-4 Strikemaster fitted out as an EW and ELINT aircraft flying over the SWA/Namibia border with Angola', ' The purpose of this latter aircraft was to both intercept all Angolan, Cuban and SWAPO radio transmissions, before jamming their communications networks at the appropriate time', ' The successful jamming of the SWAPO, Angolan and Cuban communications network is one of the reasons for the late reaction by either of the latter two in responding to the attack', '  PLAN PLAN, the armed wing of SWAPO, was a guerrilla army and therefore did not have a traditional command and control structure', ' As such, it is impossible to determine a composition of units inside Cassinga', ' According to TRC findings, a self-defence unit posted at Cassinga consisted of approximately 300 male and female PLAN cadres (other source: approximately 300 to 600)', ' The military section of Cassinga was easily partitioned from the non-military sections', ' The overall commander of PLAN in town was Dimo Amaambo, who responsible for the co-ordination of all PLAN actions in Southern Angola, including incursions into South West Africa/Namibia', ' A headquarters such as

personnel carriers, seven trucks and four anti-aircraft guns, accompanied by around 400 troops', ' This unit was known to SADF intelligence, who had intercepted their radio traffic, and were also aware of their anti-UNITA operations', ' Their strength was estimated at 144 in October 1977, and was a major contributing factor in the choice of air rather than a ground assault', "" In briefing the strike aircrew, the SAAF Chief of Staff Intelligence was specific that there was no known military formation within 80 miles, except for a detachment of 'African police' with one truck"", "" In debriefs, when questioned by commanders and aircrew of the 2 strike components, Canberras and Buccaneers, he insisted that the Cuban formation being just some 15\xa0km to the south at Tetchamutete was 'a complete surprise and must have been deployed there in recent days'"", ' Certainly, no photo reconnaissance over that village/road junction was ordered, but could easily have been included in the later Canberra PR overflights of Cassinga', '  Attack  04h00 – 09h00  Air movements thumb|right|SAAF Canberra bomber The first to move on the morning of the attack were the paratroopers of the Composite Para Bn, who got up at 04h00 and began fitting their weapons, equipment and parachutes', '  At 05h19, the four Buccaneers bombers took off from AFB Waterkloof, followed at 05h43 by the faster Canberra', "" The heavily laden 'Buccs' could fly only at medium altitude, so their true airspeed (TAS) was considerably lower than that of the 'Cans', flying over  higher"", ' One of the Buccaneers went to an air force base nearer to the Angolan border in order to refuel and act as a close air support (CAS) aircraft, while the fifth aircraft of the Buccaneer strike force was delayed due to a brake problem, leaving four Buccaneers available for the initial strike', '  At 06h00 the eight transport aircraft carrying the paratroopers became airborne', ' Two of the Transall C-160s, carrying the reserve company of 116 paratroopers, peeled off and entered a holding pattern just south of the border so as to be available to drop reinforcements during the battle', ' The remaining six transports continued on towards a holding point some miles east of Cassinga', '  At about 06h30, the ELINT/EW Douglas DC-4 became airborne and settled into a holding pattern just south of the border', "" At the same time, a flight of two Puma helicopters, under the command of Major John Church, took off from 'a jungle night-stop' to fly to a clearing 22\xa0km east of Cassinga in order to set up a Helicopter Administration Area (HAA), where the helicopters used in the operation could refuel"", "" On board the two helicopters were Commandant James Kriel, the commander of the South African Air Force's Mobile Air Operations Team (MAOT) and his signaller, as well as Major James Hills, commander of Bravo Company, 1 Bn, along with one ten-man section from the two Hawk Groups he would be using to protect the HAA"", ' Also in the two helicopters were six 200-litre drums of helicopter fuel, and, to the consternation of Hills, the Chief of the South African Army, Lieutenant-General Constand Viljoen', '  The MAOT set up their radios and navigational beacons at the HAA, by now code-named Whisky-Three, and signalled the all-clear for the rest of the force, consisting of the rest of the Hawk Group protection element (31 paratroopers), six medical personnel, two more members of the MAOT and eighty-six 200-litre drums of helicopter fuel, all on board a fleet of five Super Frelon and ten Puma helicopters', ' The HAA was then completed, and the 17 helicopters refuelled and waited for the call to extract the paratroopers after the completion of the attack', '  Also at around 07h00 the solitary Cessna C-185 took off and began flying towards Cassinga', ' Its role in the operation was to be an airborne observation post, giving the all-clear for the paratrooper drop, as well as being a radio-relay aircraft (known as ""Telstar duty"" in the SAAF)', ' It would later be forced to withdraw due to sustained anti-aircraft fire', ' At around 07h50 two Mirage III fighter aircraft took off, heading straight for Cassinga', '  Bombing runs The defence-suppression bombing attack by the Canberras was two minutes late, occurring at 08h02 instead of 08h00 as originally planned, because the lead navigator failing to maintain effective timing-adjustment during the  low-level approach phase', ' This made no difference to the intended effect', "" As the bombing had been timed to coincide with SWAPO's daily roll call on the parade ground, most of the people in the camp were assembled in the open when the Canberras initiated their low-level fragmentation bomb attack from the north"", ' Each of the four Canberras – flying in loose \'line abreast\' at  and 300 knots – dropped 300 Rhodesian-designed ""Alpha"" fragmentation bombs, which were small  finless bombs like \'10-Pin Bowling\' balls, designed to bounce up to  into the air before detonating', "" A zone of some 800 metres by 500 metres was carpeted, each aircraft having its own 'bomb line'"", ' The weapons were devastatingly effective against the assembled groupings below, causing most of SWAPO\'s casualties on the day, and also destroying vehicles, POL (""Petroleum Oil Lubricants"", military acronym for flammable liquids) storage tanks and soft buildings', '  Immediately after the Canberras came the Buccaneers, from the west, who flew their dive-bombing runs along a generally east–west axis', ' Photography from the cockpit of one of the aircraft showed the graphic lines of the preceding ""Alpha"" bomb strikes, was released to the SA press the following day', "" Of the total of thirty-two 1000\xa0lb (450\xa0kg) conventional bombs dropped by the four Buccaneers on the identified 'hard points', 24 scored direct hits, causing an immense amount of damage"", ' Finally, the two Mirage IIIs conducted a strafing run on the target, using their 30\xa0mm DEFA cannons', ' All the aircraft except for the solitary Buccaneer on CAS duty then flew back to air bases in South West Africa (Namibia) to refuel and re-arm to provide close air support if required – the Mirages to Ondangwa air force base, the Canberras, Buccaneers and C-130/C-160s to Grootfontein air force base, where their support teams and material had been ferried up from Pretoria during the morning', ' The Canberras and Buccaneers were used for a later strike on the Chetequera complex', '  Parachute drop After the attack aircraft had finished their bombing runs the six transports, which had been holding in wait to the east, commenced their formation run towards Cassinga at an altitude of 200 feet (60 m)', ' Shortly before reaching the base, the six aircraft climbed to , the drop height, and lined up for the drop', "" However, required visual 'tracking and distance' co-ordination markers were obscured by smoke from the bombing run, the drop zone (DZ) box scaling and drop point distances were incorrect – due to the reconnaissance scaling errors – and the drop was a shambles with nearly all the paratroopers being dropped off-target, some on the West side of the river and some into tall maize where they had problems linking up"", "" The resultant confusion caused numerous delays, ruining the schedule of the 'drop-to-contact' plan, and much of the advantage of surprise"", ' The disastrous drop also meant that it would be nearly an hour before C-Company was able to move into position on the eastern side of the camp and seal off the escape routes and as a result a number of top PLAN commanders, including Dimo Amaambo and Greenwell Matongo (two principal targets of the attack) escaped (with Amaambo later becoming the first head of the Namibian Defence Force in 1990)', '  The two independent rifle platoons, No', '9 and No', '11, were dropped quite accurately to the north', ' They immediately went into action, moving through a tented camp to the north-west of Cassinga, beyond the bombed areas', ' Resistance was fierce but short-lived, and a total of 54 bodies were counted by the platoons before they took up their position along the northern end of the base to seal off that escape route', '  Of the four main paratrooper companies, D-Company had experienced the most accurate drop, though they were still 500 m from their intended drop zone', ' Regrouping quickly, they moved to attack structures which had been identified in the aerial reconnaissance photos as engineering buildings', ' However, during the assault on these buildings several of them exploded, perhaps due to ammunition stores within, injuring several paratroopers', ' There was also a brief blue-on-blue engagement as D-Company paratroopers were mistakenly fired upon by their fellow soldiers from B-Company, which by then had reached the base, but there were no casualties', ' After completing the assault of the engineer complex, D-Company moved south to set up a stop-line and prevent any guerrillas from escaping via that route', ' It also dispatched the anti-tank platoon to lay a tank ambush on the road to Techamutete', '  09h00 – 12h00 By 09h00, A and B Companies had regrouped and were ready to commence the main assault on Cassinga', ' Instead of attacking eastwards as initially planned, the two companies attacked the base in a northerly direction', ' Initially, they encountered very little resistance, though this changed dramatically once the paratroopers neared the centre of the base', ' Heavy sniper fire was directed at the paratroopers from a number of trees inside the base, they were subjected to B-10 recoilless rifle fire, and some SWAPO guerrillas had regrouped, using houses as cover from which to fire at the paratroopers, critically wounding two paratroopers', '  thumb|ZPU-2 anti-aircraft gun However, the paratroopers faced their greatest challenge when they were fired upon by a number of ZPU-2 14', '5\u2009mm multi-barrel anti-aircraft guns used in the ground role', ' This brought both companies to a complete halt, as they were unable to move under the accurate, and close, fire of the guns, and the Buccaneer on CAS duty could not conduct a strike on the guns for fear of hitting the paratroopers close by', '  In the end, Colonel Breytenbach ordered the commander of D-Company to take some men and work up towards the guns by attacking the trenches to the west of Cassinga', ' He also ordered the mortar platoon to begin attacking the guns', '  Upon entering the trenches, the men from D-Company were surprised to find a number of civilians, whom they later asserted were being used as human shields by the guerrillas hiding inside', '  The guerrillas opened fire on the paratroopers, leading the paratroopers to enter what they described later as a mode of ""kill or be killed"", in which preventing the deaths of the civilians in the trenches was allegedly impossible', "" Though a number of civilians were killed in those trenches, as the paratroopers moved forward encountered less and less civilians until nearer the guns all those in the trenches, male and female, were wearing SWAPO's Cuban-style uniforms"", ' In the meantime, 9 Platoon had entered the trenches from the north, though were making slow progress as they came under the attention of the gunners', '  After a combination of the attack through the trenches and the mortar fire, the guns were silenced', ' The toll was an acceptable one for the South Africans; there were at least 95 SWAPO fighters dead inside the trenches and around the guns', ' Three paratroopers had been killed', '  After the fall of the guns, all major resistance in Cassinga ended', ' The odd sniper and corners of light resistance were all that remained, and the mopping up process was soon finished', ' The paratroopers immediately set up the Bn HQ and Regimental Aid-Post (RAP) next to the SWAPO hospital, and began treating the worst of the injured', ' Overall, three paratroopers had been killed, and eleven wounded, two of them critically', ' In addition, a fourth paratrooper was found to be missing, presumed killed', ' It was later assumed that he had drowned after being dropped in the river during the parachute jump, or that his parachute had malfunctioned', '  By now the attack was two hours behind schedule, with the first helicopter extractions having been planned for 10h00', '  12h00 – 15h00 Brigadier Du Plessis at this time informed Colonel Breytenbach of a radio interception, indicating that the Cuban force at Techamutete was deploying', '  The SADF had been given explicit operational instructions to avoid conflict with the Cubans, but delays on the part of SADF now made that a distinct possibility', ' Brigadier Du Plessis insisted on extracting all the troops immediately, however Colonel Breytenbach wanted to secure the LZ first', ' A compromise was agreed whereby half the paratroopers would move to the LZ where 12 Puma helicopters would extract them, while the remainder would continue clearing operations, as well as to collect any and all documents of intelligence value', '  At around 13h00, Colonel Breytenbach was informed by one of the Buccaneers on CAS duty that the Cuban mechanised battalion was moving up the road from Techamutete to Cassinga', '  The Buccaneer had spotted an advancing column of around 30 assorted AFVs, APCs, T-34 tanks and other vehicles advancing slowly up the road from Techamutete', ' It immediately opened fire on the column, destroying three BTR-152 armoured personnel carriers in the process, but then had to return to Grootfontein air force base to re-arm and refuel, leaving about 200 of the remaining paratroopers temporarily unprotected', ' All that stood between them and the advancing armoured column were the 22 men of the anti-tank platoon, armed only with 10 RPG-7 rocket launchers and five anti-tank mines which they had planted in the road', ""  At this time however, there was a serious breakdown in the South Africans' command and control, and a number of fundamental errors were made"", ' The shuttle of helicopters to and from Whiskey-Three, the HAA, as well as the order in which paratroopers were embarked, was improvised and initially uncoordinated and disorganised', "" It wasn't made initially clear to the commander of the helicopter extraction force quite what the problem – and the sudden urgency – was"", ' Furthermore, two engineers, whose role was to destroy enemy equipment, departed in the first wave with all the demolition fuses before all the equipment had been disabled', '  Meanwhile, the Cuban column advanced directly into the ambush that the paratroopers had set for them', '  The lead T-34 tank was destroyed by one of the anti-tank mines, while the paratroopers destroyed four of the BTR-152s using their RPG-7s', "" They also killed approximately 40 of the Cuban troops before making their 'fighting retreat' back along the road towards the Helicopter Landing Zone (HLZ) east of Cassinga where Breytenbach was organising the remaining paratroopers for final extraction"", ' In the face of the oncoming armoured column, Breytenbach ordered a thin defensive line, but realised the lightly armed paratroopers stood little chance against the armoured vehicles and prepared to fall-back into the bush to an emergency LZ while calling urgently for air support', '  The initial success of the SADF assault now looked like turning into a disaster with the imminent prospect of being overrun by Cuban armoured forces,  into enemy territory', ' General Viljoen, who until this time had been wearing his rank and beret, removed and hid them', '  At 14h20, when the Cuban AFVs were already in sight of the beleaguered paratroopers, a Buccaneer and two Mirage IIIs arrived overhead', ' An experienced Forward Air Controller (FAC) amongst the paratroopers began to direct the three aircraft in strikes against the advancing Cuban armour', ' The Mirage IIIs, with their 30\xa0mm cannons, destroyed 10 BTR-152s before running low on fuel and returning to Ondangwa air force base', "" The Mirages' cannons were unable to destroy any tanks, but the sole Buccaneer destroyed at least two tanks, an anti-aircraft position and a number of other vehicles with its 68\xa0mm SNEB air-to-ground rockets"", ' The rockets had been omitted from the original Operation Order, but the Buccaneer Squadron Commander had fortuitously chosen to include them in the ordnance that was ferried to the Grootfontein forward air force base by C-130 Hercules, with his ground crews and maintenance spares', ' The Buccaneer pilot was being fired on continually by a towed 14', '5\xa0mm anti-aircraft gun, at which he had to make two passes before he was able to destroy it with rockets', '  The Buccaneer ran out of ammunition at this point, but this coincided with the arrival of the 17 helicopters to extract the remaining paratroopers in the second wave', "" The helicopters' arrival betrayed the position of the LZ to the remaining Cuban forces, who began to advance on the area"", ' While unable to see the armoured vehicles, the paratroopers could hear their engines and gunfire, and could see trees being flattened in their path barely  away', "" In a desperate attempt to prevent the Cuban tanks from firing at the vulnerable helicopters and the assembling SA troops waiting to be picked up, the Buccaneer pilot dived his aircraft dangerously low, nearly hitting trees as he flew close over the top of the tanks in mock attacks, disorienting the crews and forcing them to break off their developing attack on the Parabats' positions"", ' There were several holes in the airframe, including one on the armoured front visor glass, needing swift patching by groundcrew after landing, refuelling and re-arming', '  Because of the disorganisation with the first wave of helicopters, there was nearly not enough space for all the remaining paratroopers and prisoners on the second wave', ' In the ensuing chaos and panic to scramble aboard the helicopters, 40\xa0SWAPO prisoners, intended to be taken back to South West Africa for interrogation, had to be released to lighten the aircraft', ' Some excess equipment and ammunition was also dumped from the overloaded helicopters', ' A final barrage of fire from the paratroopers stalled the closing Cuban armour just sufficiently long enough to complete the extraction of the assembled paratroops', '  However ten minutes after taking off, two of the Puma helicopters were directed to return to Cassinga, as it was feared that some of the paratroopers might have been left behind', ' They spotted a group of people huddled together, but closer inspection revealed that they were the prisoners who had been left behind', ' The helicopters flew a total of four low passes looking for paratroopers, when one of the helicopter pilots spotted a Cuban tank appearing from the bushes', ' He warned the other Puma pilot, who was able to bank away just in time so that the tank round missed the aircraft', ' No paratroopers were found and the two Pumas returned to the HAA', ' The dismantling of the HAA continued throughout the rest of the day', '  15h00 – 18h00 At 15h00, one of the Mirage IIIs returned to Cassinga, and once again strafed the Cuban vehicles that were still on the road, setting at least one of them alight', ' It was replaced at 15h30 by another aircraft and a Buccaneer which proceeded to destroy more of the vehicles and a building', ' About a kilometre south of Cassinga, the Buccaneer attacked another column of vehicles, coming under heavy anti-aircraft fire in the process', '  Another Buccaneer arrived at 16h45, surprised some Cubans moving through the ruins and destroyed a T-34 tank and some anti-aircraft guns in the process, while further Mirage and Buccaneer strikes at 17h10 and 18h35 destroyed another tank and other equipment', ""  The result was that by nightfall nearly the entire Cuban battalion had been destroyed, killing around 150 Cuban soldiers, accounting for that country's biggest single-day casualty rate during its military involvement in Angola"", '  A complete Angolan tank brigade relief force, arriving at dusk, was too late to have any impact and found only scenes of destruction at what had once been Cassinga', '  Aftermath According to an Angolan government white paper, the official toll of the Cassinga Raid was a total of 624 dead and 611 injured civilians as well as combatants', ' Among the dead were 167 women and 298 teenagers and children', ' Since many of the combatants were female or teenagers and many combatants did not wear uniforms, the exact number of civilians among the dead could not be established', '  A secret report to the SWAPO Central Committee listed 582 dead and 400 wounded', '  The South Africans declared the attack on Cassinga to be a great military success, even though disaster was so closely averted by the intervention of the SAAF, and in the face of a SWAPO propaganda campaign that labelled the event a massacre', '  Despite inflicting heavy casualties, the SADF did not kill or capture Dimo Amaambo or any other senior SWAPO leaders', '  The SADF casualties were low for such an attack, an important factor in South Africa where the public was intolerant of high casualty rates: Three soldiers were killed, one was missing in action presumed dead (landed in river, failed to emerge), and eleven were wounded', '  According to General Constand Viljoen, Cassinga set the strategy for the SADF for the next ten years, i', 'e', ' that of launching pre-emptive strikes at SWAPO inside Angola, even though subsequent actions would be armoured rather than air assaults', '  SWAPO launched Operation Revenge, a retaliatory bombardment of Katima Mulilo in the Caprivi Strip on 23 August 1978, during which 10 soldiers were killed and 10 injured as a result of a direct hit on their barracks by an 82\xa0mm mortar bomb', '  Sixteen guerrillas were killed in a SADF follow-up operation  into Zambia', '  Political consequences thumb|One of the mass graves at Cassinga  According to General Geldenhuys the raid was a ""jewel of military craftmanship"", but politically it was a disaster for the apartheid regime', ' A media campaign had been carefully prepared well in advance of the operation and media releases managed in order to create an impression that SADF intervention was at the request of the SWA administration, and to counter negative reports on South African military actions and claims of killing innocent civilians', ' This campaign included the fabrication and distortion of SWAPO actions', ' One of the parachute battalions was specifically tasked to take photographs and instructed to focus on images supporting the South African cause; bodies were only to be photographed with weapons by their side', ' Negative images, such as suffering victims, were to be avoided', ' Nevertheless, in spite of these instructions, pictures of bodies without weapons and of dead SADF paratroopers were taken', 'SADF photographs by Mike McWilliams included pictures of bodies without weapons, and pictures of dead SADF paratroopers', '  The Angolans were first to publish details of the attack, followed shortly thereafter by SWAPO press statements that supported and elaborated on the Angolan account', '  They described the base as a refugee camp and claimed the SADF had slaughtered 600 defenceless refugees', ' The bodies were buried in two mass graves at Cassinga; pictures of one of the mass graves was used extensively for propaganda purposes, and for many people therefore became the imagery that they associated with the event', '  The debate over whether Cassinga was a military camp or a refugee camp (or both) continues to rage', '  Weapons and military installations were present and documented at the camp', ' In 1998 the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission also concluded that  The United Nations invited SWAPO-leader Sam Nujoma to

after the fighting', '  After defeating a FAPLA garrison at the nearby town of Caxito, an army of ELNA militants led personally by Holden Roberto began advancing southwards towards Luanda', ""

destroyed by FAPLA and its Cuban allies', '  Background  Since the late fifteenth century, Portugal had administered Angola as part of a vast African empire which included Mozambique and Portuguese Guinea (modern day Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau)', ' Following the loss of Brazil and the erosion of its influence in the Americas during the early nineteenth century, Portugal increasingly refocused

of its senior leaders, namely Agostinho Neto, were professionals and intellectuals educated in European universities', ' It was in this educated elite that the combination of anti-colonial resentment

to supporting the attack, gambling on the likelihood that if their guns could drive the defenders underground into their bunkers, then an immediate and well-coordinated infantry assault might break through', '  Colonel e Castro, who supported a direct frontal assault on Quifangondo, was responsible for most of the operational planning for the attack', ' However, some of the other Portuguese volunteers were more skeptical', ' The dissenters insisted that Roberto should consider a flanking movement through the swamps as his main avenue of approach', ' Alternatively, flanking attacks could be made through the swamps to support the main advance along the highway', ' This option had already been discussed between Roberto and his South African advisers and rejected for several reasons: the swampy terrain east of the highway was impassable to the wheeled vehicles, possessed inadequate cover to bestow an advantage in concealment, and the ELNA infantry had flatly refused to cross it on foot, citing the hazard posed by crocodiles and venomous snakes', '  Battle South African artillery and air bombardment On the evening of 9 November, the South African and Zairean artillery on Morro

advantage, and only followed ELNA's retreat with caution weeks after the battle"", ' In the words of South African historian Willem Steenkamp, ""the Cubans and FAPLA missed a marvelous opportunity to deal the FNLA a major knockout blow: a reasonably strong mechanised force could have taken full advantage of the general confusion and panic to thrust all the way to Ambriz', '""  Aftermath Casualties

commented that the morale of the FNLA\'s political wing had been just as badly shaken: ""we retreated [from Quifangondo]', ' However, in this defeat, the political party became much more defeated than

destroyed by FAPLA and its Cuban allies', '  Background  Since the late fifteenth century, Portugal had administered Angola as part of a vast African empire which included Mozambique and Portuguese

southern Angola, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) was formed by Jonas Savimbi and drew its recruits from Ovimbundu farm labourers and itinerant peasants', ' A third movement, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), was formed by the Angolan Communist Party and targeted the embryonic upper working class of public sector workers in Luanda', ' Most of its senior leaders, namely Agostinho Neto, were professionals and intellectuals educated in European universities', ' It was in this educated elite that the combination of anti-colonial resentment and exposure to international political theory came to be most articulated; for example, the MPLA invested heavily in lobbying campaigns overseas which won it support and recognition among political

the battlefield', ' Until the formation of the militant wings, disputes between the movements had been largely confined to political theory', ' However, beginning in late 1961 there were a number of clashes between ELNA and FAPLA that became central to the rivalry between the FNLA and MPLA, and evolved into outright hostility', ' It was not uncommon for ELNA to intercept and kill FAPLA personnel who strayed into its area of operations', ' Hamstrung by violent divisions, the insurgents aggravated the colonial administration but did not threaten its control of the territory', ""  In late April 1974, Portugal's authoritarian Estado Novo government was toppled by the Carnation Revolution, which sounded the death knell for that country's pretensions as a colonial empire"", ' Angolan

subjects, but found little support for this measure in the progressive atmosphere which dominated local politics after the revolution', ' On 27 July 1974, he bowed to pressure and announced that the colonies were to be granted independence, unconditionally', '  By November 1974 the authority and morale of the Portuguese security forces in Angola had been seriously undermined; meanwhile, the three

lethal as tensions grew', ' The insurgents also seized large quantities of Portuguese weapons from the arsenals of disbanding colonial units', ' As long as their administrative structures were not

the bulk of the FAPLA garrison was made of new recruits evacuated from a training camp in Vila Salazar', ' In late October, FAPLA had closed the camp and abandoned Vila Salazar to refocus on defending Luanda', ' The Vila Salazar recruits were hastily thrown into battle during the unsuccessful attack on Morro do Cal, and had been driven back to Quifangondo by a combined ELNA-Zairean force along with

Soviet Union donated another 10 T-34-85s to FAPLA, promising to have them delivered to Luanda before 10 November', ' While not very formidable from a conventional standpoint, the presence of the archaic T-34-85s was a decisive factor, since ELNA had no tanks of its own to counter them', "" As Roberto's troops neared Luanda in early November, the tanks were dug into the hills east of the

endorsed a withdrawal from the Quifangondo front in favour of a broad encircling movement from the east"", ' Roberto rejected their counsel', ' This was his last chance to destroy FAPLA before Angolan independence was bestowed; furthermore, he thought it desirable to strike before FAPLA was further strengthened by its Cuban and Soviet allies', '  The South Africans reluctantly resigned themselves to supporting the attack, gambling on the likelihood that if their guns could drive the defenders underground into their bunkers, then an immediate and well-coordinated infantry assault might break through', '  Colonel e Castro, who supported a direct frontal assault on Quifangondo, was responsible for most of the operational planning for the attack', ' However, some of the other Portuguese volunteers were more skeptical', ' The dissenters insisted that Roberto should consider a flanking movement through the swamps as his main avenue of approach', ' Alternatively, flanking attacks could be made through the swamps to support the main advance along the highway', ' This option had already been discussed between Roberto and his South African advisers and rejected for several reasons: the swampy terrain east of the highway was impassable to the wheeled vehicles, possessed inadequate cover to bestow an advantage in concealment, and the ELNA infantry had flatly refused to cross it on

after the fighting', '  After defeating a FAPLA garrison at the nearby town of Caxito, an army of ELNA militants led personally by Holden Roberto began advancing southwards towards Luanda', ""

dislodge FAPLA from the vital waterworks at Quifangondo and an adjoining bridge which spanned the Bengo River', ' Air cover for the ELNA offensive was provided by a squadron of South African English Electric Canberra bombers', "" The defenders consisted of FAPLA's 9th Brigade and just under a hundred Cuban military advisers, bolstered by a composite battery of ZiS-3 anti-tank guns and Grad rocket launchers"", ""  Following a poorly coordinated artillery bombardment and an ineffectual South African air strike, ELNA light and motorised infantry attacked the bridge early on the morning on 10 November, but became trapped in the open while crossing an elevated roadway and shelled by the defenders' rockets"", ' The ELNA advance stalled, and the attackers were unable to regain their initiative', ' Roberto committed his reserves, but by noon his entire force had been routed with heavy casualties and nearly all their vehicles destroyed', ' The ELNA forces broke into a disorderly retreat and could only be re-mustered that evening', ' Realising the battle was lost, the South African and Zairean troops withdrew to the nearby port of Ambriz and were later evacuated by their respective governments', '  While the battle was taking place, Portugal renounced its claims to Angolan sovereignty and withdrew the remainder of its colonial administrative and military personnel from Luanda', "" On the morning of 11 November, the MPLA proclaimed the People's Republic of Angola, which was immediately recognised by Cuba, the Soviet Union, Brazil, and several sympathetic African states"", ' ELNA had suffered such a catastrophic defeat at Quifangondo that Roberto was unable to launch another major offensive; over the next two months his forces were gradually scattered and destroyed by FAPLA and its Cuban allies', '  Background  Since the late fifteenth century, Portugal had administered Angola as part of a vast African empire which included Mozambique and Portuguese Guinea (modern day Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau)', ' Following the loss of Brazil and the erosion of its influence in the Americas during the early nineteenth century, Portugal increasingly refocused on the consolidation of its African colonies', "" As the largest, most developed, and most heavily populated colony in the Portuguese Empire, Angola came to replace Brazil as Lisbon's most valuable overseas possession"", ' Angolan nationalists, led by the nascent Angolan Communist Party, periodically challenged colonial rule, to little avail', ' The trend towards global decolonisation during the late 1940s and 1950s delivered an unprecedented boost to nationalist confidence and ambitions, and in January 1961 the Angolan War of Independence broke out when radicalised peasants launched the Baixa de Cassanje revolt', ""  Between 1961 and 1964, three major nationalist movements rose to prominence in the fighting between the Portuguese security forces and local anti-colonial militants supported to varying degrees by the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and several newly independent African states"", ' The National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA) was led by Holden Roberto and recruited mostly from the Bakongo population of northern Angola and the Cabinda exclave, an area traditionally dominated by the Kingdom of Kongo', ' In the central highlands and southern Angola, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) was formed by Jonas Savimbi and drew its recruits from Ovimbundu farm labourers and itinerant peasants', ' A third movement, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), was formed by the Angolan Communist Party and targeted the embryonic upper working class of public sector workers in Luanda', ' Most of its senior leaders, namely Agostinho Neto, were professionals and intellectuals educated in European universities', ' It was in this educated elite that the combination of anti-colonial resentment and exposure to international political theory came to be most articulated; for example, the MPLA invested heavily in lobbying campaigns overseas which won it support and recognition among political leaders in Africa and the Middle East', ' Its use of Marxist political language and open criticism of the United States in particular proved effective at winning support with the Soviet Union and leftist governments elsewhere', ""  thumb|left|FNLA leader Holden Roberto All three movements quickly formed militant wings to coordinate their insurgent campaigns against the Portuguese: the FNLA formed the National Liberation Army of Angola (ELNA), UNITA formed the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FALA), and the MPLA formed the People's Armed Forces of Liberation of Angola (FAPLA)"", ' The creation of three separate insurgent armies provoked internecine strife which doomed any attempt to present a united front against the Portuguese and limited their effectiveness on the battlefield', ' Until the formation of the militant wings, disputes between the movements had been largely confined to political theory', ' However, beginning in late 1961 there were a number of clashes between ELNA and FAPLA that became central to the rivalry between the FNLA and MPLA, and evolved into outright hostility', ' It was not uncommon for ELNA to intercept and kill FAPLA personnel who strayed into its area of operations', ' Hamstrung by violent divisions, the insurgents aggravated the colonial administration but did not threaten its control of the territory', ""  In late April 1974, Portugal's authoritarian Estado Novo government was toppled by the Carnation Revolution, which sounded the death knell for that country's pretensions as a colonial empire"", ' Angolan nationalists perceived the political upheaval in Lisbon as an opportunity to upend the colonial order; the MPLA, FNLA, and UNITA rejected ceasefire requests and all demanded the Portuguese affirm an unconditional right to independence', ' General António de Spínola, head of the Portuguese provisional government, was initially in favour of retaining the colonies as semi-autonomous federal subjects, but found little support for this measure in the progressive atmosphere which dominated local politics after the revolution', ' On 27 July 1974, he bowed to pressure and announced that the colonies were to be granted independence, unconditionally', '  By November 1974 the authority and morale of the Portuguese security forces in Angola had been seriously undermined; meanwhile, the three nationalist movements were attempting to exploit the developing power vacuum by amassing troops and stockpiling arms', "" The nationalists' political and military wings rushed to establish authority on the ground, moving rapidly to take over key towns left unguarded by the withdrawing Portuguese"", ' Massive shipments of foreign arms from their various allies made the movements increasingly more lethal as tensions grew', ' The insurgents also seized large quantities of Portuguese weapons from the arsenals of disbanding colonial units', ' As long as their administrative structures were not attacked, the Portuguese made no attempt to enforce internal security, and the nationalists were able to continue their troop and weapons buildup unopposed', ""  Prelude ELNA expelled from Luanda

capitals"", ' However, distracted by an internal power struggle between Agostinho Neto and Daniel Chipenda, it was unable to consolidate its control of Luanda', ' In October, Holden Roberto took advantage of the situation to begin airlifting ELNA troops into Luanda from their training camps in neighbouring Zaire', ' With each movement extending its influence over the local population, the uneasy peace soon broke down and within a month the capital had erupted into bloody street battles', "" On 3 January 1975, at the behest of Organisation of African Unity, Neto, Roberto, and UNITA's Savimbi signed an accord in which they agreed to a permanent truce and promised to terminate mutually hostile propaganda"", ' The nationalists then participated in a multi-party conference in Alvor, Portugal, which formed a coalition government of MPLA, FNLA, UNITA, and Portuguese representatives to govern Angola during the interim period', ' The coalition government would draft a constitution, to be followed by democratic elections', "" Angola's independence date was set for 11 November 1975, the four hundredth anniversary of the founding of Luanda"", ""  Fighting almost immediately broke out in Luanda again when Neto took advantage of the ceasefire to launch a purge of Chipenda's supporters"", ' The Chipenda faction was largely annihilated, leaving ELNA as the only remaining obstacle to FAPLA control of the city', ' Chipenda and 2,000 of his surviving troops defected to ELNA around February, which further heightened tensions', "" ELNA had the largest number of personnel inside Angola at the time, and was further strengthened by over 400 tonnes of weaponry donated by the People's Republic of China and channelled through a sympathetic Zaire"", ' ELNA also benefited from covert financial aid supplied by the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)', "" Roberto was pressed by his field commanders to destroy Neto's forces while he held an indisputable advantage in manpower and logistics over his opponent"", ' On 23 March, ELNA began attacking FAPLA bases in Luanda', ' A week later, a motorised column of 500 ELNA troops drove into the capital to join the fighting, unopposed by the Portuguese troops on duty', "" The threat posed by ELNA's troop buildup was proving far more formidable than Neto had anticipated, and near the end of March he appealed to the Soviet Union and Cuba for military backing"", '  As an ELNA victory in Luanda had become more apparent, Soviet policymakers grew increasingly anxious about Angola', "" They believed that Angola's fate carried heavy implications for the global strategic and diplomatic momentum gained by the Soviet sphere after the end of the Vietnam War"", ' They saw Roberto as an agent of Bakongo tribalism rather than a true revolutionary and assumed that his success would serve the interests of Beijing and Washington', ' The coincidence of Chinese and American patronage of Roberto was especially alarming, as it seemed to indicate the possibility of a future Sino-American alliance dominating Angola, to the detriment of Soviet interests', "" The result was approval of Neto's request for a massive increase in Soviet military aid to FAPLA"", ' During March 1975 alone, Soviet pilots flew thirty planeloads of weapons into Brazzaville, where they were unloaded and transported by rail, truck, and ship to waiting FAPLA units around Luanda', "" In the span of three months, the Soviet Union had airlifted thirty million dollars' worth of weaponry to FAPLA"", ' Neto had received enough new arms to equip an additional 20,000 troops, and this proved instrumental in turning the tide against Roberto', ' Additionally, a Soviet military delegation offered to provide training instructors and logistics staff during well-publicised talks with the MPLA leadership on 25 April', ' For its part, Cuba deployed a contingent of 230 military advisers and technicians to Angola to assemble Soviet hardware and train an influx of new FAPLA recruits', ' The first Cuban advisers began arriving in May', '  The infusion of Soviet arms helped fuel increasingly heavier confrontations in Luanda and provided the raw material for a major conventional FAPLA counteroffensive', ' In late May FAPLA violated a short-lived ceasefire by attacking and defeating several ELNA garrisons in the Cuanza Norte, Malanje, and Uíge provinces', ' Buoyed by these victories, the MPLA Politburo authorised a counteroffensive with the objective of isolating and destroying ELNA in Luanda', ' Between 3 June and 5 June, FAPLA eliminated the ELNA presence in the Cabinda exclave', ' The Portuguese succeeded in imposing a ceasefire on 7 June, but this was short-lived: the ELNA units stationed in Luanda had been sapped

occurred after the gun had been double loaded with propellant by its inexperienced crew, all of whom died in the blast', ' The second Zairean field gun was later disabled by a misfire, which injured

Morro de Cal, where Roberto reinforced them with his reserves', ' Attempts to reconstitute the assault group at the farm were severely hampered by two salvoes of enemy rocket fire, possibly from the

advantage, and only followed ELNA's retreat with caution weeks after the battle"", ' In the words of South African historian Willem Steenkamp, ""the Cubans and FAPLA missed a marvelous opportunity to deal the FNLA a major knockout blow: a reasonably strong mechanised force could have taken full advantage of the general confusion and panic to thrust all the way to Ambriz', '""  Aftermath Casualties Combined ELNA and Zairean military casualties at the Battle of Quifangondo were between 100 and 150 dead, and around 200 wounded', ' Roberto stated that ELNA alone had suffered 120 confirmed dead, and estimated the total number of wounded as probably being double that', ' According to American military analyst Spencer C', ' Tucker, an accurate count would be higher, with the number of ELNA and Zairean dead running into the multiple hundreds', '  South Africa suffered one wounded', ' The Portuguese volunteers suffered five dead', '  ELNA lost the vast majority of its vehicles at Quifangondo,

was evacuated to Ambriz', ' After the battle, a Zairean soldier was found alive in a wrecked armoured car and taken prisoner by FAPLA', '  FAPLA suffered one dead—a recruit who had disobeyed orders and left his trench when the fighting started; he was killed by ELNA machine gun fire', ' An additional three FAPLA personnel were wounded', ' Cuba suffered two wounded', '  Impact on ELNA The Battle of Quifangondo had enormous strategic implications for the course of the Angolan Civil War', "" It dashed Roberto's hopes of capturing Luanda before Angola's independence date, and all but assured

its colony to ""the Angolan people"" and departed Luanda by sea', ' He was followed shortly thereafter by the last of the Portuguese military personnel', "" At midnight, Neto proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of Angola"", ' The new state was immediately recognised by 30 sovereign nations, including the Soviet Union, Brazil, and Cuba', "" In response, Roberto and his

withdraw towards Ambriz with their leader"", ' Roberto had lost all but two companies—almost his entire army—along the Caxito-Ambriz front by 24 November', ' His foreign allies gradually evaporated, too', ' In the aftermath of the battle, Colonel Lama lost almost two-thirds of his command due to desertion', ' Brigadier Roos gave Roberto some parting advice on fighting delaying actions and arranged to have his logistics staff and artillery crews evacuated from Ambriz by a South African Navy frigate, the SAS President Steyn', "" On 17 November, the frigate's crew used a helicopter and several inflatable boats to extract all South African personnel from the Ambriz shoreline"", ' The 5', ""5-inch medium guns were initially towed to Zaire to prevent them from falling into FAPLA's hands"", ' All were returned to South Africa by plane shortly afterwards', '  In his book The Cuban Intervention in Angola, Edward George wrote that ""it is no exaggeration to say that the battle of Quifangondo destroyed the FNLA, even if fighting between them and the FAPLA–Cubans was to continue for another four months', '"" Tonta Afonso Castro, a member of the ELNA general staff, later commented that the morale of the FNLA\'s political wing had been just as badly shaken: ""we retreated [from Quifangondo]', ' However, in this defeat, the political party became much more defeated than the soldiers who were on the ground', '""  On 5 December, FAPLA finally launched a major counteroffensive northwards, recapturing Caxito', ' Roberto had little alternative but to abandon Ambriz and flee towards the Zairean border', ' The last Zairean paratroops withdrew from northern Angola around that time', ' Stockwell caustically wrote of the undisciplined Zairean withdrawal: ""Mobutu\'s finest', '', '', 'vented their frustration on the villages and towns in the path of their flight, in a tidal wave of terrorism, rape, and pillage, until the Kongo tribesmen of northern Angola prayed for the early arrival of the MPLA and Cuban liberators', '""  Deprived of its last remaining ally, ELNA was no match for the combined FAPLA and Cuban armies marshalled against it, and from January 1976 onwards the war in northern Angola became a virtually one-sided affair, with FAPLA advancing rapidly towards the Zairean border in the face of sporadic local resistance', ""  With most of his traditional areas of support under FAPLA occupation, and the final collapse of ELNA as a fighting force, Roberto's bid for political power in Angola was over"", ' He fled into exile in Zaire in

bridge which spanned the Bengo River.Prior to the civil war, the settlement was primarily known for being the location of a reservoir which supplied water to Luanda.Its defence had assumed increasing
