AO-2011-6#-00000156,"Calueque is a town next to a dam and pumping station of the same name on the Kunene River in the Kunene Province of southern Angola. The water project is linked to Ruacana, away in Namibia, where the Ruacana Power Station is. This dam is one of the last landmarks along the Kunene River, prior to the Kunene becoming a border feature between Angola and Namibia. A pipeline and canal extends across the border into Namibia, supplying towns as far away as Oshakati in Ovamboland with water. The dam was completed in 1976. The area to the north of the dam became the scene of bloody fighting which proved to be a turning point in the war. On 27 June 1988, the South Africans retreated across the dam to South-West Africa and the same day Cuban MiG-23 fighters attacked the facilities. The dam and pipelines were considerably damaged, rendering the scheme inoperable. Whilst the Calueque Dam and bridge were neglected since the bombing of 1988, the Angolan Government in April 2012 signed a US$225million contract for the rehabilitation of the dam wall, the construction of two hydro plants, a new channel and 21 irrigation pivots"

AO-2011-6#-00000156,"Calueque is a town next to a dam and pumping station of the same name on the Kunene River in the Kunene Province of southern Angola. The water project is linked to Ruacana, away in Namibia, where the Ruacana Power Station is. This dam is one of the last landmarks along the Kunene River, prior to the Kunene becoming a border feature between Angola and Namibia. A pipeline and canal extends across the border into Namibia, supplying towns as far away as Oshakati in Ovamboland with water. The dam was completed in 1976. The area to the north of the dam became the scene of bloody fighting which proved to be a turning point in the war. On 27 June 1988, the South Africans retreated across the dam to South-West Africa and the same day Cuban MiG-23 fighters attacked the facilities. The dam and pipelines were considerably damaged, rendering the scheme inoperable. Whilst the Calueque Dam and bridge were neglected since the bombing of 1988, the Angolan Government in April 2012 signed a US$225million contract for the rehabilitation of the dam wall, the construction of two hydro plants, a new channel and 21 irrigation pivots"
