PE-2009-5Z-00000419,1.0,"Subaqueous dunes can form from the action of water flow (fluvial processes) on sand or gravel beds of rivers, estuaries, and the sea-bed. The dynamic action of wind and water can sometimes cause dunes to drift, which can have serious consequences. The stability of the dunes was once attributed to the vegetative cover but recent research has pointed to water as the main source of parabolic dune stability. Models of coastal dunes suggest that their final equilibrium height is related to the distance between the water line and where vegetation can grow. These plants are well adapted to the harsh conditions of the foredune, typically having deep roots which reach the water table, root nodules that produce nitrogen compounds, and protected stoma, reducing transpiration. These too are adapted to the low soil water content and have small, prickly leaves which reduce transpiration. These include:  Little available soil moisture  Little available soil organic matter/nutrients/water  Harsh winds  Salt spray  Erosion/shifting and sometimes burial or exposure (from shifting)  Tidal influences There are many adaptations plants have evolved to cope with these pressures:  Deep taproot to reach water table (Pink Sand Verbena)  Shallow but extensive root systems Rhizomes  Prostrate growth form to avoid wind/salt spray (Abronia spp., Beach Primrose)  Krummholz growth form (Monterrey Cypress-not a dune plant but deals with similar pressures)  Thickened cuticle/Succulence to reduce moisture loss and reduce salt uptake (Ambrosia/Abronia spp., Calystegia soldanella)  Pale leaves to reduce insolation (Artemisia/Ambrosia spp.) Thorny/Spiky seeds to ensure establishment in vicinity of parent, reduces chances of being blown away or swept out to sea (Ambrosia chamissonis)  Gypsum dunes [[File:Aerial view of dunefield, White Sands National Park, New Mexico, United States.png|thumb|Gypsum dune fields, White Sands National Park, New Mexico, United States]] In deserts where large amounts of limestone mountains surround a closed basin, such as at White Sands National Park in south-central New Mexico, occasional storm runoff transports dissolved limestone and gypsum into a low-lying pan within the basin where the water evaporates, depositing the gypsum and forming crystals known as selenite. Sub-aqueous dunes  Sub-aqueous (underwater) dunes form on a bed of sand or gravel under the actions of water flow. Once in this form, water passing through the rock can carry and deposit minerals, which can alter the color of the rock. The sand is likely composed of hydrocarbon particles, possibly with some water ice mixed in.Peeking Through the Haze: Titan's Surface, part II—The Planetary Society Blog | The Planetary Society   Dunes are a popular theme in science fiction, featuring in depictions of dry Desert planets appearing as early as the 1956 film Forbidden Planet and Frank Herbert's 1965 novel Dune."

The dynamic action of wind and water can sometimes cause dunes to drift, which can have serious consequences. The stability of the dunes was once attributed to the vegetative cover but recent research has pointed to water as the main source of parabolic dune stability. Models of coastal dunes suggest that their final equilibrium height is related to the distance between the water line and where vegetation can grow. These plants are well adapted to the harsh conditions of the foredune, typically having deep roots which reach the water table, root nodules that produce nitrogen compounds, and protected stoma, reducing transpiration. These too are adapted to the low soil water content and have small, prickly leaves which reduce transpiration. These include:  Little available soil moisture  Little available soil organic matter/nutrients/water  Harsh winds  Salt spray  Erosion/shifting and sometimes burial or exposure (from shifting)  Tidal influences There are many adaptations plants have evolved to cope with these pressures:  Deep taproot to reach water table (Pink Sand Verbena)  Shallow but extensive root systems Rhizomes  Prostrate growth form to avoid wind/salt spray (Abronia spp., Beach Primrose)  Krummholz growth form (Monterrey Cypress-not a dune plant but deals with similar pressures)  Thickened cuticle/Succulence to reduce moisture loss and reduce salt uptake (Ambrosia/Abronia spp., Calystegia soldanella)  Pale leaves to reduce insolation (Artemisia/Ambrosia spp.) Thorny/Spiky seeds to ensure establishment in vicinity of parent, reduces chances of being blown away or swept out to sea (Ambrosia chamissonis)  Gypsum dunes [[File:Aerial view of dunefield, White Sands National Park, New Mexico, United States.png|thumb|Gypsum dune fields, White Sands National Park, New Mexico, United States]] In deserts where large amounts of limestone mountains surround a closed basin, such as at White Sands National Park in south-central New Mexico, occasional storm runoff transports dissolved limestone and gypsum into a low-lying pan within the basin where the water evaporates, depositing the gypsum and forming crystals known as selenite. Sub-aqueous dunes  Sub-aqueous (underwater) dunes form on a bed of sand or gravel under the actions of water flow. Once in this form, water passing through the rock can carry and deposit minerals, which can alter the color of the rock. The sand is likely composed of hydrocarbon particles, possibly with some water ice mixed in.Peeking Through the Haze: Titan's Surface, part II—The Planetary Society Blog | The Planetary Society   Dunes are a popular theme in science fiction, featuring in depictions of dry Desert planets appearing as early as the 1956 film Forbidden Planet and Frank Herbert's 1965 novel Dune."
