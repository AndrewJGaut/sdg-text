PE-2000-4#-00001343,1.0,"Like Everest, Chimborazo is also known for climbing; its climb demands skill and is often on black ice, so crampons and other high-tech climbing equipment are required. Glaciers thumb|290px|Chimborazo from the south The top of Chimborazo is completely covered by glaciers, with some north-eastern glacier arms flowing down to 4,600 m. Its glacier is the source of water for the population of the Bolivar and Chimborazo provinces of Ecuador. Chimborazo glacier's ice mass has decreased over the past decades, which is thought by some to be due to the combined influences of global warming, ash covers from recent volcanic activity of Tungurahua, and the El Niño phenomenon. As on other glaciated Ecuadorian mountains, Chimborazo's glacial ice is mined by locals (the so-called Hieleros from Spanish Hielo for Ice) to be sold in the markets of Guaranda and Riobamba. In earlier days, the people transported ice for cooling uses down to coastal towns such as Babahoyo or Vinces. It temporarily dammed the Río Chambo, causing an ephemeral lake. In many dialects of Quichua or Quechua, ""chimba"" means ""on the other side"" as in ""on the other side of the river"" or ""on the opposite bank."" Also, ""razu"" means ""ice"" or ""snow.""

The area of permanent ice cover shrank by about a third between the 1970s and 2006. The Cordillera Blanca is the most extensive tropical ice-covered mountain range in the world and has the largest concentration of ice in Peru. Most of the glaciers, 91% of the total, were classified as mountain glaciers (they are generally short and have extremely steep slopes); the rest were classified as valley glaciers, except for one ice cap. Lakes  Among the most important lakes in the range are the Llanganuco Lakes, which are located on the northern side of Huascarán, and are accessible from the town of Yungay; the deep-turquoise Lake Parón (the biggest lake in the Cordillera Blanca), located just north of Huandoy, accessible from the town of Caraz; Lakes Ichiccocha and Jatuncocha, which are near Artesonraju and Alpamayo and are accessible only by trekking or on horseback from Caraz.

This expedition was broken into three separate groups and the upper Amazon section was covered by ""The Flying Expedition"" tasked with exploring the upper third to Arequipa from the river's origin. Traditionally, explorers and geographers define the origin of a river system by tracking the longest tributaries while heading upstream, as volume can change dramatically from month to month. During their descent, they found melt water dropping into a fissure. They discovered that within the fissure, the water was deep enough to float a small craft, and realized that they were presented with an opportunity.

Its glacier is the source of water for the population of the Bolivar and Chimborazo provinces of Ecuador. Chimborazo glacier's ice mass has decreased over the past decades, which is thought by some to be due to the combined influences of global warming, ash covers from recent volcanic activity of Tungurahua, and the El Niño phenomenon. As on other glaciated Ecuadorian mountains, Chimborazo's glacial ice is mined by locals (the so-called Hieleros from Spanish Hielo for Ice) to be sold in the markets of Guaranda and Riobamba. In earlier days, the people transported ice for cooling uses down to coastal towns such as Babahoyo or Vinces. It temporarily dammed the Río Chambo, causing an ephemeral lake.
