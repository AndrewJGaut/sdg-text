horizon where the sun and other celestial bodies rose or set at the solstices', ' Many prehistoric indigenous cultures in the Americas and elsewhere constructed earthworks that combined such astronomical sighting with their religious cosmology, as did the late Mississippian culture at Cahokia and other sites in present-day United States', ' Another example is Stonehenge in England', '

Castro (1977) proposed a multi-functional interpretation of the geoglyphs', ' He classified them into three groups: the first appeared to be tracks connected to irrigation and field division, the second are lines that are axes connected with mounds and cairns, and the third was linked to astronomical interpretations', 'Rossel Castro, Albert (1977) Arqueología Sur del Perú, Lima: Editorial Universo  In 1985, archaeologist Johan Reinhard published archaeological, ethnographic, and historical data demonstrating that worship of mountains and other water sources predominated in Nazca

water, which directly related to the success and productivity of crops', ' He interpreted the lines as sacred paths leading to places where these deities could be worshiped', ' The figures were symbols representing animals and objects meant to invoke the aid of the deities in supplying water', ' The precise meanings of many of the individual geoglyphs remain unknown', '  Henri Stierlin, a Swiss art historian specializing in Egypt and the Middle East, published a book in 1983 linking the Nazca Lines to the production of ancient textiles that archeologists have found wrapping mummies of the Paracas culture', 'Stierlin (1983)  He contended that the people may have used the lines and trapezes as giant, primitive looms to fabricate the extremely long strings and wide pieces of textiles typical of the area', ' According to his theory, the figurative patterns (smaller and less common) were meant only for ritualistic purposes', ' This theory is not widely accepted, although scholars have noted similarities in patterns between the textiles and the Nazca Lines', ' They interpret these similarities as arising from the common culture', '  The first systematic field study of the geoglyphs was made by Markus Reindel and Johny Cuadrado Island', ' Since 1996, they have documented and excavated more than 650 sites', '  They compared the iconography of the lines to  ceramics of

Nicola Masini and Giuseppe Orefici have conducted research in Pampa de Atarco, about 10\xa0km (6\xa0mi) south of Pampa de Nasca, which they believe reveals a spatial, functional and religious

horizon where the sun and other celestial bodies rose or set at the solstices', ' Many prehistoric indigenous cultures in the Americas and elsewhere constructed earthworks that combined such astronomical sighting with their religious cosmology, as did the late Mississippian culture at Cahokia and other sites in present-day United States', ' Another example is Stonehenge in England', ' Newgrange in Ireland has tombs that are oriented to admit light at the winter solstice', '  Gerald Hawkins and Anthony Aveni, experts in archaeoastronomy, concluded in 1990 that the evidence was

Castro (1977) proposed a multi-functional interpretation of the geoglyphs', ' He classified them into three groups: the first appeared to be tracks connected to irrigation and field division, the second are lines that are axes connected with mounds and cairns, and the third was linked to astronomical interpretations', 'Rossel Castro, Albert (1977) Arqueología Sur del Perú, Lima: Editorial Universo  In 1985, archaeologist Johan Reinhard published archaeological, ethnographic, and historical data demonstrating that worship of mountains and other water sources predominated in Nazca religion and economy from ancient to recent times', ' He theorized that the lines and figures were part of religious practices involving the worship of deities associated with the availability of water, which directly related to the success and productivity of crops', ' He interpreted the lines as sacred paths leading to places where these deities could be worshiped', ' The figures were symbols representing animals and objects meant to invoke the aid of the deities in supplying water', ' The precise meanings of many of the individual geoglyphs remain unknown', '  Henri Stierlin, a Swiss art historian specializing in Egypt and the Middle East, published a book in 1983 linking the Nazca Lines to the production of ancient textiles that archeologists have found wrapping mummies of the Paracas culture', 'Stierlin (1983)  He contended that the people may have used the lines and trapezes as giant, primitive looms to fabricate the extremely long strings and wide pieces of textiles typical of the area', ' According to his theory, the figurative patterns (smaller and less common) were meant only for ritualistic purposes', ' This theory is not widely accepted, although scholars have noted similarities in patterns between the textiles and the Nazca Lines', ' They interpret these similarities as arising from the common culture', '  The first systematic field study of the geoglyphs was made by Markus Reindel and Johny Cuadrado Island', ' Since 1996, they have documented and excavated more than 650 sites', '  They compared the iconography of the lines to  ceramics of

geophysical investigations and the observation of geological faults, David Johnson argued that some geoglyphs followed the paths of aquifers from which aqueducts (or puquios) collected water', '  Nicola Masini and Giuseppe Orefici have conducted research in Pampa de Atarco, about 10\xa0km (6\xa0mi) south of Pampa de Nasca, which they believe reveals a spatial, functional and religious relationship between these geoglyphs and the temples of Cahuachi', '  In particular, using  remote sensing techniques (from satellite to drone based remote sensing), they investigated  and found ""five groups of geoglyphs, each of them characterized by a specific motif and shape, and associated with a distinct function', '"" They identified a ceremonial one, characterized by meandering motifs', ' Another is related to calendrical purpose, as proved by the presence of radial centers aligned along the directions of winter solstice and equinox sunset', '  As have earlier scholars, the two Italians believe that the geoglyphs were the venues of events linked to the agriculture calendar', ' These also served to strengthen social cohesion among various groups of pilgrims, sharing common ancestors and religious beliefs', '  A study of the lines using hydrogeology and tectonics shows that many of the lines are utilitarian features born out of the need to harness and manage

second are lines that are axes connected with mounds and cairns, and the third was linked to astronomical interpretations', 'Rossel Castro, Albert (1977) Arqueología Sur del Perú, Lima: Editorial Universo  In 1985, archaeologist Johan Reinhard published archaeological, ethnographic, and historical data demonstrating that worship of mountains and other water sources predominated in Nazca religion and economy from ancient to recent times', ' He theorized that the lines and figures were part of religious practices involving the worship of deities associated with the availability of water, which directly related to the success and productivity of crops', ' He interpreted the lines as sacred paths leading to places where these deities could be worshiped', ' The figures were symbols representing animals and objects meant to invoke the aid of the deities in supplying water', ' The precise meanings of many of the individual geoglyphs remain unknown', '  Henri Stierlin, a Swiss art historian specializing in Egypt and the Middle East, published a book in 1983 linking the Nazca Lines to the production of ancient textiles that archeologists have found wrapping mummies of the Paracas culture', 'Stierlin (1983)  He contended that the people may have used the lines and trapezes as giant, primitive looms to fabricate the extremely long strings and wide pieces of textiles typical of the area', ' According to his theory, the figurative patterns (smaller and less common) were meant only for ritualistic purposes', ' This theory is not widely accepted, although scholars have noted similarities in patterns between the textiles and the Nazca Lines', ' They interpret these similarities as arising from the common culture', '  The first systematic field study of the geoglyphs was made by Markus Reindel and Johny Cuadrado Island', ' Since 1996, they have documented and excavated more than 650 sites', '  They compared the iconography of the lines to  ceramics of the cultures', ' As archeologists, they believe that the figurative motifs of geoglyphs can be dated to having been made between 600 and 200 BCE', 'Reindel and Wagner, 2009   Based on the results of geophysical investigations and the observation of geological faults, David Johnson argued that some geoglyphs followed the paths of aquifers from which aqueducts (or puquios) collected water', '  Nicola Masini and Giuseppe Orefici have conducted research in Pampa de Atarco, about 10\xa0km (6\xa0mi) south of Pampa de Nasca, which they believe reveals a spatial, functional and religious relationship between these geoglyphs and the temples of Cahuachi', '  In particular, using  remote sensing techniques (from satellite to drone based remote sensing), they investigated  and found ""five groups of geoglyphs, each of them characterized by a specific motif and shape, and associated with a distinct function', '"" They identified a ceremonial one, characterized by meandering motifs', ' Another is related to calendrical purpose, as proved by the presence of radial centers aligned along the directions of winter solstice and equinox sunset', '  As have earlier scholars, the two Italians believe that the geoglyphs were the venues of events linked to the agriculture calendar', ' These also served to strengthen social cohesion among various groups of pilgrims, sharing common ancestors and religious beliefs', '  A study of the lines using hydrogeology and tectonics shows that many of the lines are utilitarian features born out of the need to harness and manage freshwater resources in a desert environment, and reflect the general movement of surface water downslope', 'http://impacttectonics', 'org/2020/2020%20Nazca%20Tectonics%20and%20Hydrogeology', 'html  Alternative explanations right|thumb|Satellite picture of an area containing lines: north is to the right (coordinates: ) Other theories were that the geometric lines could indicate water flow or irrigation schemes, or be a part of rituals to ""summon"" water', ' The spiders, birds, and plants may be fertility symbols', ' It also has been theorized that the lines could act as an astronomical calendar', '  Phyllis Pitluga, senior astronomer at the Adler Planetarium and a protégé of Reiche, performed computer-aided studies of star alignments', ' She asserted the giant spider figure is an anamorphic diagram of the constellation Orion', "" She further suggested that three of the straight lines leading to the figure were used to track the changing declinations of the three stars of Orion's Belt"", ' In a critique of her analysis, Dr', ' Anthony F', ' Aveni noted she did not account for the other 12 lines of the figure', '  He commented generally on her conclusions, saying: I really had trouble finding good evidence to back up what she contended', ' Pitluga never laid out the criteria for selecting the lines she chose to measure, nor did she pay much attention to the archaeological data Clarkson and Silverman had unearthed', "" Her case did little justice to other information about the coastal cultures, save applying, with subtle contortions, Urton's representations of constellations from the highlands"", ' As historian Jacquetta Hawkes might ask: was she getting the pampa she desired?Aveni, Anthony F', ' (2006)', ' Between the Lines: The Mystery

form of flight to observe the figures properly', ' Based on his study of available technology, he suggests a hot-air balloon was the only possible means of flight at the time of construction', ' To test this hypothesis, Woodmann made a hot-air balloon using materials and techniques he understood to have been available to the Nazca people', ' The balloon flew, after a fashion', ' Most scholars

characterized Nickell\'s work as ""remarkable in its exactness"" when compared to the existing lines', 'Nickell, Joe (2005)', ' Unsolved History: Investigating Mysteries of the Past, The University Press of Kentucky , pp', ' 13–16 With careful planning and simple technologies, Nickell proved that a small team of people could recreate even the largest figures within days, without any aerial assistance', '  Most of the lines are formed on the ground by a shallow trench, with a depth between ', ' Such trenches were made by removing for a portion of the design, the reddish-brown, iron oxide-coated pebbles that cover the surface of the Nazca Desert', ' When this gravel is removed, the light-colored clay earth exposed in the bottom of the trench contrasts sharply in color and tone with the surrounding land surface, producing visible lines', ' This sub-layer contains high amounts of lime', ' With moisture from morning mist, it hardens to form a protective layer that shields the lines from winds, thereby preventing erosion', '  The Nazca used this technique to ""draw"" several hundred simple, but huge, curvilinear animal and human figures', ' In total, the earthwork project is huge and complex: the area encompassing the lines is nearly , and the largest figures can span nearly 370 m (1,200\xa0ft)', ' Some figures have been measured: the hummingbird is  long, the condor is , the monkey is , and the spider is ', ' The extremely dry, windless, and constant climate of the Nazca region has preserved the lines well', ' This desert is one of the driest on Earth and maintains a temperature near  year round', ' The lack of wind has helped keep the lines uncovered and visible', '  The discovery of two new small figures was announced in early 2011 by a Japanese team from Yamagata University', ' One of these resembles a human head and is dated to the early period of Nazca culture or earlier', ' The other, undated, is an animal', ' The team has been conducting

culture to try to determine the purpose of the lines and figures', ' One hypothesis is that the Nazca people created them to be seen by deities in the sky', '  Paul Kosok and Maria Reiche advanced a purpose related to astronomy and cosmology, as has been common in monuments of other ancient cultures: the lines were intended to act as a kind of observatory, to point to the places on the distant horizon where the sun and other celestial bodies rose or set at the solstices', ' Many prehistoric indigenous cultures in the Americas and elsewhere constructed earthworks that combined such astronomical sighting with their religious cosmology, as did the late Mississippian culture at Cahokia and other sites in present-day United States', ' Another example is Stonehenge in England', ' Newgrange in Ireland has tombs that are oriented to admit light at the winter solstice', '  Gerald Hawkins and Anthony Aveni, experts in archaeoastronomy, concluded in 1990 that the evidence was insufficient to support such an astronomical explanation', '  Maria Reiche asserted that some or all of the figures represented constellations', ' By 1998, Phyllis B', ' Pitluga, a protégé of Reiche and senior astronomer at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, had concluded that the animal figures were ""representations of heavenly shapes', '"" According to The New York Times, Pitluga ""contends

Castro (1977) proposed a multi-functional interpretation of the geoglyphs', ' He classified them into three groups: the first appeared to be tracks connected to irrigation and field division, the second are lines that are axes connected with mounds and cairns, and the third was linked to astronomical interpretations', 'Rossel Castro, Albert (1977) Arqueología Sur del Perú, Lima: Editorial Universo  In 1985, archaeologist Johan Reinhard published archaeological, ethnographic, and historical data demonstrating that worship of mountains and other water sources predominated in Nazca religion and economy from ancient to recent times', ' He theorized that the lines and figures were part of religious practices involving the worship of deities associated with the availability of water, which directly related to the success and productivity of crops', ' He interpreted the lines as sacred paths leading to places where these deities could be worshiped', ' The figures were symbols representing animals and objects meant to invoke the aid of the deities in supplying water', ' The precise meanings of many of the individual geoglyphs remain unknown', '  Henri Stierlin, a Swiss art historian specializing in Egypt and the Middle East, published a book in 1983 linking the Nazca Lines to the production of ancient textiles that archeologists have found wrapping mummies of the Paracas culture', 'Stierlin (1983)  He contended that the people may have used the lines and trapezes as giant, primitive looms to fabricate the extremely long strings and wide pieces of textiles typical of the area', ' According to his theory, the figurative patterns (smaller and less common) were meant only for ritualistic purposes', ' This theory is not widely accepted, although scholars have noted similarities in patterns between the textiles and the Nazca Lines', ' They interpret these similarities as arising from the common culture', '  The first systematic field study of the geoglyphs was made by Markus Reindel and Johny Cuadrado Island', ' Since 1996, they have documented and excavated more than 650 sites', '  They compared the iconography of the lines to  ceramics of the cultures', ' As archeologists, they believe that the figurative motifs of geoglyphs can be dated to having been made between 600 and 200 BCE', 'Reindel and Wagner, 2009   Based on the results of geophysical investigations and the observation of geological faults, David Johnson argued that some geoglyphs followed the paths of aquifers from which aqueducts (or puquios) collected water', '  Nicola Masini and Giuseppe Orefici have conducted research in Pampa de Atarco, about 10\xa0km (6\xa0mi) south of Pampa de Nasca, which they believe reveals a spatial, functional and religious relationship between these geoglyphs and the temples of Cahuachi', '  In particular, using  remote sensing techniques (from satellite to drone based remote sensing), they investigated  and found ""five groups of geoglyphs, each of them characterized by a specific motif and shape, and associated with a distinct function', '"" They identified a ceremonial one, characterized by meandering motifs', ' Another is related to calendrical purpose, as proved by the presence of radial centers aligned along the directions of winter solstice and equinox sunset', '  As have earlier scholars, the two Italians believe that the geoglyphs were the venues of events linked to the agriculture calendar', ' These also served to strengthen social cohesion among various groups of pilgrims, sharing common ancestors and religious beliefs', '  A study of the lines using hydrogeology and tectonics shows that many of the lines are utilitarian features born out of the need to harness and manage

calendar', '  Phyllis Pitluga, senior astronomer at the Adler Planetarium and a protégé of Reiche, performed computer-aided studies of star alignments', ' She asserted the giant spider figure is an

wooden stakes in the ground at the end of some lines, which supports this theory', ' One such stake was carbon-dated and was the basis for establishing the age of the design complex', '  Joe Nickell, an American investigator of the paranormal, religious artifacts, and folk mysteries, reproduced the figures in the early 21st century by using the same tools and technology that would have been available to the Nazca people', ' In so doing, he refuted the 1969 hypothesis of Erich von Däniken, who suggested that ""ancient astronauts"" had constructed these works', ' Scientific American

oxide-coated pebbles that cover the surface of the Nazca Desert', ' When this gravel is removed, the light-colored clay earth exposed in the bottom of the trench contrasts sharply in color and tone with the surrounding land surface, producing visible lines', ' This sub-layer contains high amounts of lime', ' With moisture from morning mist, it hardens to form a protective layer that shields the lines from winds, thereby preventing erosion', '  The Nazca used this technique to ""draw"" several hundred simple, but huge, curvilinear animal and human figures', ' In total, the earthwork project is huge and complex: the area encompassing the lines is nearly , and the largest figures can span nearly 370 m (1,200\xa0ft)', ' Some figures have been measured: the hummingbird is  long, the condor

purpose related to astronomy and cosmology, as has been common in monuments of other ancient cultures: the lines were intended to act as a kind of observatory, to point to the places on the distant horizon where the sun and other celestial bodies rose or set at the solstices', ' Many prehistoric indigenous cultures in the Americas and elsewhere constructed earthworks that combined such astronomical sighting with their religious cosmology, as did the late Mississippian culture at Cahokia and other sites in present-day United States', ' Another example is Stonehenge in England', ' Newgrange in Ireland has tombs that are oriented to admit light at the winter solstice', '  Gerald Hawkins and Anthony Aveni, experts in archaeoastronomy, concluded in 1990 that the evidence was insufficient to support such an astronomical explanation', '  Maria Reiche asserted that some or all of the figures represented constellations', ' By 1998, Phyllis B', ' Pitluga, a protégé of Reiche

Castro (1977) proposed a multi-functional interpretation of the geoglyphs', ' He classified them into three groups: the first appeared to be tracks connected to irrigation and field division, the second are lines that are axes connected with mounds and cairns, and the third was linked to astronomical interpretations', 'Rossel Castro, Albert (1977) Arqueología Sur del Perú, Lima: Editorial Universo  In 1985, archaeologist Johan Reinhard published archaeological, ethnographic, and historical data demonstrating that worship of mountains and other water sources predominated in Nazca religion and economy from ancient to recent times', ' He theorized that the lines and figures were part of religious practices involving the worship of deities associated with the availability of water, which directly related to the success and productivity of crops', ' He interpreted the lines as sacred paths leading to places where these deities could be worshiped', ' The figures were symbols representing animals and objects meant to invoke the aid of the deities in supplying water', ' The precise meanings of many of the individual geoglyphs remain unknown', '  Henri Stierlin, a Swiss art historian specializing in Egypt and the Middle East, published a book in 1983 linking the Nazca Lines to the production of ancient textiles that archeologists have found wrapping mummies of the Paracas culture', 'Stierlin (1983)  He contended that the people may have used the lines and trapezes as giant, primitive looms to fabricate the extremely long strings and wide pieces of textiles typical of the area', ' According to his theory, the figurative patterns (smaller and less common) were meant only for ritualistic purposes', ' This theory is not widely accepted, although scholars have noted similarities in patterns between the textiles and the Nazca Lines', ' They interpret these similarities as arising from the common culture', '  The first systematic field study of the geoglyphs was made by Markus Reindel and Johny Cuadrado Island', ' Since 1996, they have documented and excavated more than 650 sites', '  They compared the iconography of the lines to  ceramics of the cultures', ' As archeologists, they believe that the figurative motifs of geoglyphs can be dated to having been made between 600 and 200 BCE', 'Reindel and Wagner, 2009   Based on the results of geophysical investigations and the observation of geological faults, David Johnson argued that some geoglyphs followed the paths of aquifers from which aqueducts (or puquios) collected water', '  Nicola Masini and Giuseppe Orefici have conducted research in Pampa de Atarco, about 10\xa0km (6\xa0mi) south of Pampa de Nasca, which they believe reveals a spatial, functional and religious relationship between these geoglyphs and the temples of Cahuachi', '  In particular, using  remote sensing techniques (from satellite to drone based remote sensing), they investigated  and found ""five groups of geoglyphs, each of them characterized by a specific motif and shape, and associated with a distinct function', '"" They identified a ceremonial one, characterized by meandering motifs', ' Another is related to calendrical purpose, as proved by the presence of radial centers aligned along the directions of winter solstice and equinox sunset', '  As have earlier scholars, the two Italians believe that the geoglyphs were the venues of events linked to the agriculture calendar', ' These also served to strengthen social cohesion among various groups of pilgrims, sharing common ancestors and religious beliefs', '  A study of the lines using hydrogeology and tectonics shows that many of the lines are utilitarian features born out of the need to harness and manage

first stage featured an alternation of explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions', ' Two events took place 500,000±270,000 and 370,000±150,000 years ago', ' It also featured a sector collapse in the northeastern sector of Sara Sara', '   During the second stage lava domes grew and collapsed on the volcano, one such event occurred 162,000±20,000 years ago on the eastern flank', '  The third stage consisted of dacitic lava flows that built the actual cone of the volcano, beginning 63,000-58,000 years ago', '  Sometimes considered part of the third stage, the last stage produced  long lava flows

astronomical sighting with their religious cosmology, as did the late Mississippian culture at Cahokia and other sites in present-day United States', ' Another example is Stonehenge in England', '

In the 1730s, Roman Catholic Franciscan missionaries established missions in the Gran Pajonal, but the missions were destroyed in the 1740s by the Ashaninka under the leadership of Juan Santos Atahualpa', '  Beginning again in 1897, missionaries, collectors of rubber, settlers, and the government of Peru began to encroach on the Gran Pajonal', ' In the 1980s, the Asháninka achieved a measure of security when most of the land of the Gran Pajonal was deeded to 36 communities', ' The population of the Gran Pajonal in 2002 was estimated at 7,000, of which 90 percent were Asháninka', '  Description The plateau area of the Gran Pajonal as defined by different scholars is between  to ', ' The term Gran Pajonal is often applied loosely to a much larger area', ' The Gran Pajonal has elevations ranging from about  to  and is incised by the headwaters of several small rivers', '   The Gran Pajonal was named by the Spanish because, in a region of tropical rain forest, it features patches of small grasslands amounting to about 4 percent of its total area', ' The Pajonal has no definite boundaries, but lies east of the Cerro de la Sal (Salt Mountain) area and is an outlier of the Andes', '  It rises above the Palcazu River on the west and the Ucayali River on the east and is bordered on the south by the Perene and Tambo rivers', ' The El Sira Communal Reserve and mountains

cultivation by the indigenous people', ' In 2004 another  of grasslands used as pasture had been created since 1975 by immigrants to the area, mostly farmers from the Andes', '  History The indigenous people inhabiting the Gran Pajonal at the time of its discovery by the Spanish were called Campa, Anti, or Chuncho by the Spaniards and are known to scholars and themselves as Asháninka, a widespread people of the Amazon Basin of Peru and neighboring Brazil', ' The Asháninka of the Gran Pajonal are sometimes called Ashéninka as their language is distinct from other divisions of the ethnic group', ' Like most peoples of the Amazon rainforest, they practiced slash-and-burn agriculture', ' Their principle crop was manioc (yuka), but they also cultivated bananas, peanuts, beans, and many other useful plants', ' The Asháninka farmer might grow as many as 50 different plants on his farm', '  The Gran Pajonal was difficult of access due to its elevation and lack of navigable rivers', '  The first Spaniard to visit was Juan Bautista de la Marca, a Franciscan missionary, in 1733', '  The area was immediately attractive to both missionaries and settlers due to its relatively dense population of indigenous people and more salubrious climate than the Amazon lowlands', ' In 1735, an armed expedition including three Franciscans began missionary work and by 1739 the Franciscans were working in 10 villages', '  Following the common Spanish strategy of reductions, the Franciscans began to force the indigenous people to live in communities adjacent to the missions rather than dispersed in small groups as was their custom', ' The rebellion of Juan Santos Atahualpa, beginning in 1742, destroyed the missionary enterprise and left the Gran Pajonal in Asháninka control for 150 years although they suffered from periodic epidemics of European diseases and in the late 19th century from slave raids by businesses engaged in the gathering of rubber', '  In 1896 and 1897, a Franciscan priest, Gabriel Sala, visited the Grand Pajonal along with a group of armed men', ' In the wake of his expedition, various plans to built roads, railroads, and establish Catholic missions in the Pajonal came to nothing until 1935 when three missions were established and in 1938 an airstrip was built in Oventeni, the largest of the mission communities', ' In 1965, the Peruvian army defeated a guerrilla organization, the Left Revolutionary Movement in a battle in the Pajonal and the army remained in Oventeni for 3 years', ' The missions were closed', '  In 1965, another religious organization, the Wycliffe Translators began work in the Pajonal and the majority of the missionaries became Protestants rather than Roman Catholics', ' The Protestant presence coincided with the growing consciousness of the Asháninka that they must organize to meet the challenges facing them from outsiders', '  In the 1980s, with assistance from the World Bank and Denmark, the Asháninka achieved legal title to land belonging to 36 communities in the Gran Pajonal', ' Non-Asháninka, mostly people of Andean origin, were allowed to reside and own land only in the community of Oventeni', ' Some of the Asháninka worked as cattle herders or coffee harvesters for the outsiders; others practiced traditional agriculture on the lands within their communities', '  Administration and

In the 1730s, Roman Catholic Franciscan missionaries established missions in the Gran Pajonal, but the missions were destroyed in the 1740s by the Ashaninka under the leadership of Juan Santos Atahualpa', '  Beginning again in 1897, missionaries, collectors of rubber, settlers, and the government of Peru began to encroach on the Gran Pajonal', ' In the 1980s, the Asháninka achieved a measure of security when most of the land of the Gran Pajonal was deeded to 36 communities', ' The population of the Gran Pajonal in 2002 was estimated at 7,000, of which 90 percent were Asháninka', '  Description The plateau area of the Gran Pajonal as defined by different scholars is between  to ', ' The term Gran Pajonal is often applied loosely to a much larger area', ' The Gran Pajonal has elevations ranging from about  to  and is incised by the headwaters of several small rivers', '   The Gran Pajonal was named by the Spanish because, in a region of tropical rain forest, it features patches of small grasslands amounting to about 4 percent of its total area', ' The Pajonal has no definite boundaries, but lies east of the Cerro de la Sal (Salt Mountain) area and is an outlier of the Andes', '  It rises above the Palcazu River on the west and the Ucayali River on the east and is bordered on the south by the Perene and Tambo rivers', ' The El Sira Communal Reserve and mountains

people of the Amazon Basin of Peru and neighboring Brazil', ' The Asháninka of the Gran Pajonal are sometimes called Ashéninka as their language is distinct from other divisions of the ethnic group',

first Spaniard to visit was Juan Bautista de la Marca, a Franciscan missionary, in 1733', '  The area was immediately attractive to both missionaries and settlers due to its relatively dense population of indigenous people and more salubrious climate than the Amazon lowlands', ' In 1735, an armed expedition including three Franciscans began missionary work and by 1739 the Franciscans were working in 10 villages', '  Following the common Spanish strategy of reductions, the Franciscans began to force the indigenous people to live in communities adjacent to the missions rather than dispersed in small groups as was their custom', ' The rebellion of Juan Santos Atahualpa, beginning in 1742, destroyed the missionary enterprise and left the Gran Pajonal in Asháninka control for 150 years although they suffered from periodic epidemics of European diseases and in the late 19th century from slave raids by businesses engaged in the gathering of rubber', '  In 1896 and 1897, a Franciscan priest, Gabriel Sala, visited the Grand Pajonal along with a group of armed men', ' In the wake of his expedition, various plans to built roads, railroads, and establish Catholic missions

organization, the Wycliffe Translators began work in the Pajonal and the majority of the missionaries became Protestants rather than Roman Catholics', ' The Protestant presence coincided with the growing consciousness of the Asháninka that they must organize to meet the challenges facing them from outsiders', '  In the 1980s, with assistance from the World Bank and Denmark, the Asháninka achieved legal title to land belonging to 36 communities in the Gran Pajonal', ' Non-Asháninka, mostly people of Andean origin, were allowed to reside and own land only in the community of Oventeni',
