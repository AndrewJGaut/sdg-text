them together', ' Their naming was borrowed from either ethnic group that was so unique', ' Both tribes bore the traditional names of one another', '  As a result of the intermarriage in the past, one could hardly distinguish the Krahns from the Gios in this part of Nimba until the senseless civil conflict', ' This Krahn-Gio solidarity played a major role in the selection of Coup members of the Peoples Redemption Council of 1980 that toppled the Tolbert Regime', ' The Council was made up of majority Gios and Krahns It was not until 1989 when the civil war changed the story', '  Kparblee

continued until December 24, 1989 when the Liberian civil crises erupted through Butuo', ' The crises which claimed the lives of over one hundred and fifty thousand people left behind many scars as a result of mass destruction of lives and properties perpetrated by actors from two ethnic groups of the same district who are living in the same district but with grudge for each other', '  Both groups targeted one another based on ethnic solidarity', ' For example, forces loyal to the NPFL who drew their strength and command structure from the Gio section of the district burned down Villages and

Liberian Ivorian Border', ' This change in hands caused more damages to lives and properties within the district', ' Families went against families; children went again parents on opposing sides', '  Another rift in the district can be attributed to the unceremonious removal of the District seat to Yourkorway from its original point of Kparblee, without the input of Kparblee citizens', ' This also has led to resentment and serious unfriendly interactions', ' Many times Kparblee citizens hold this as conspiracy against them by the planners of the act', ' There was no hearing at the legislature as such that could authenticate the views of all', '  To further authenticate the thoughts of the people from Kparblee, during the Gyude Bryant led administration, series of confidence building trips were made to the district through the Graie Behwallay route', ' The delegations only stopped in Yourkorway and Behwallay under the pretense that there was no other town beyond here that point and there was no road leading anywhere', ' The discouragement of the delegation cost Kparblee dearly that today the name of Kparblee is deleted from the map of the district', ' This is a wound in the hearts of the people from Zodru chiefdom', '  To the people of Kparblee, this was a revenge targeted at the town since the framers of the new act have succeeded in removing the seat to Yourkorway', ' Fingers pointed to some members of the leadership at the time which failed to address itself to the matter and has left wounds in the hearts of one section', '  Realizing the impediment that these may have on the achievement of the developmental goals of the new leadership under the gavel of Peter Kangbe, a peace building and reconciliation initiative is being proposed as the surest way forward for

could hardly distinguish the Krahns from the Gios in this part of Nimba until the senseless civil conflict', ' This Krahn-Gio solidarity played a major role in the selection of Coup members of the

for the current ones, they found, were grossly inaccurate: ""The greater part of the country has not been surveyed from a geographical standpoint, and most of the prominent features are inaccurately placed on the various maps obtainable ', '', '', ' The sources and courses of rivers, the heights of mountains, and the situations and positions of towns are usually hypothetical', ' We found that names of the great majority of the towns and villages in the interior, inscribed on the published maps were unknown to the inhabitants of the regions concerned', '"" As such, the Medical Expedition had many eyes upon it as it would inform not only medical and zoological research, but also anthropological and geological along with government and business views on Liberia regarding the current status of the country', '  Meeting with Chief Suah Koko Arriving in the Liberian capital of Monrovia, Dr', ' Strong and co', ' began by settling permits, route issues, and meeting dignitaries', ' Then, with such logistical concerns settled by the beginning of August and after making brief ventures to collect specimens in the adjacent countryside, they proceeded up the Du river to the first three Firestone Plantations before journeying into the hinterlands that, effectively, were not wholly under the control of the central government', "" The Expedition's goal being Gbarnga - then called Gbanga - (where they intended to and eventually did establish their base camp), they traversed many towns and villages en route"", ' However, while the Expedition encountered and observed many African tribes during and following this stage of their journey, one of their most historically noted meetings occurred in the beginning of September just before they arrived in Gbanga', ' This encounter being with the famed Paramount tribal chief Suah Koko of Suakoko, a formidable woman whose estimated age was 60-70 said was said to be the only female chief in the country', ' Spending a few nights in her domain, the Westerners describe Chief Suah Koko as, despite her age and near blindness, displaying ""surprising  intelligence in her conversation and [that she is] apparently feared, respected, and obeyed in her community', '"" Indeed, while peace currently reigned, the Harvard Expedition noted signs of her previous war with the Liberian Frontier Force in the heavily fortified compound that was her home; a peace that Chief Suah Koko had previously and successfully negotiated with the Liberian government', ' Hence her importance not just in Liberian politics, but also to the Expeditior - for she ruled a strategic region in that it served as a key crossing point into the Liberian hinterlands; indeed, ""without her permission and without her generosity, the Harvard expedition could not have traveled further to Gbanga and beyond', '"" A charge that the chief managed quite well, for Dr', ' Strong notes in his book that ""her province was apparently well governed, and all the promises which she made while we in the community, and in response to our requests, chiefly relating to the sales of food, to transportation, and the examination of her people were kept', '"" However, a slight yet harmless culture clash occurred between the Westerners and the Chief - one owed to the fact that the chief was a woman', "" In sum, knowing that gaining the local rulers' favor was necessary for the success of the Expedition, Dr"", ' Strong showered them with gifts consisting mainly of gin and tobacco', ' But, as the Professor notes in his diary:  Chief Suah Koko was as good as her word for, while the Medical Expedition had had difficulty throughout their Liberian journeys in securing the help of porters, Chief Suah Koko was instrumental in providing them', ' Indeed, while the Expedition members stay with the famed Chief was brief, the hospitality and aid she offered them made her a meeting with her an important event', ""  Documentation and legacy Harvard Medical African Expedition was a success with countless specimens collected and the customs of tribes such as Suah Koko's and those of the Gbanga and beyond Liberia in the Congo recorded"", ' Furthermore, the photography endeavors of Loring Whitman yielded many photos ranging from local wildlife to the everyday dress and activities of the tribes, to the flesh-eating and twisting diseases whose study was the primary purpose of the venture - all, and the details of which, are printed, explained, and analyzed in Dr', "" Strong's two-volume The African Republic of Liberia and the Belgian Congo: Based on the Observations Made and Material Collected during the Harvard African Expedition, 1926-1927"", ' Furthermore, Harold Coolidge brought back a large gorillaGoldberg, Carey: ""Filmmakers Study a Man Who Studied the Apes"", The New York Times, March 23, 1999', ' URL retrieved 2011-01-22', '  that is still on display at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology,Harvard Magazine, November/December 2007: Portrait: Janet Browne', ' URL retrieved 2011-01-22', ' and, in 1929, he published A revision of the genus Gorilla, which forms the basis of the modern taxonomy of the genus Gorilla', 'Stumpf, R', ' M', ';
