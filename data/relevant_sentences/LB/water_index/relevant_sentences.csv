a peace that Chief Suah Koko had previously and successfully negotiated with the Liberian government', ' Hence her importance not just in Liberian politics, but also to the Expeditior - for she ruled a strategic region in that it served as a key crossing point into the Liberian hinterlands;

for the current ones, they found, were grossly inaccurate: ""The greater part of the country has not been surveyed from a geographical standpoint, and most of the prominent features are inaccurately placed on the various maps obtainable ', '', '', ' The sources and courses of rivers, the heights of mountains, and the situations and positions of towns are usually hypothetical', ' We found that names of the great majority of the towns and villages in the interior, inscribed on the published maps were unknown to the inhabitants of the regions concerned', '"" As such, the Medical Expedition had many eyes upon it as it would inform not only medical and zoological research, but also anthropological and geological along with government and business views on Liberia regarding the current status of the country', '  Meeting with Chief Suah Koko Arriving in the Liberian capital of Monrovia, Dr', ' Strong and co', ' began by settling permits, route issues, and meeting dignitaries', ' Then, with such logistical concerns settled by the beginning of August and after making brief ventures to collect specimens in the adjacent countryside, they proceeded up the Du river to the first three Firestone Plantations before journeying into the hinterlands that, effectively, were not wholly under the control of the central government', "" The Expedition's goal being Gbarnga - then called Gbanga - (where they intended to and eventually did establish their base camp), they traversed many towns and villages en route"", ' However, while the Expedition encountered and observed many African tribes during and following this stage of their journey, one of their most historically noted meetings occurred in the beginning of September just before they arrived in Gbanga', ' This encounter being with the famed Paramount tribal chief Suah Koko of Suakoko, a formidable woman whose estimated age was 60-70 said was said to be the only female chief in the country', ' Spending a few nights in her domain, the Westerners describe Chief Suah Koko as, despite her age and near blindness, displaying ""surprising  intelligence in her conversation and [that she is] apparently feared, respected, and obeyed in her community', '"" Indeed, while peace currently reigned, the Harvard Expedition noted signs of her previous war with the Liberian Frontier Force in the heavily fortified compound that was her home; a peace that Chief Suah Koko had previously and successfully negotiated with the Liberian government', ' Hence her importance not just in Liberian politics, but also to the Expeditior - for she ruled a strategic region in that it served as a key crossing point into the Liberian hinterlands;

for the current ones, they found, were grossly inaccurate: ""The greater part of the country has not been surveyed from a geographical standpoint, and most of the prominent features are inaccurately placed on the various maps obtainable ', '', '', ' The sources and courses of rivers, the heights of mountains, and the situations and positions of towns are usually hypothetical', ' We found that names of the great majority of the towns and villages in the interior, inscribed on the published maps were unknown to the inhabitants of the regions concerned', '"" As such, the Medical Expedition had many eyes upon it as it would inform not only medical and zoological research, but also anthropological and geological along with government and business views on Liberia regarding the current status of the country', '  Meeting with Chief Suah Koko Arriving in the Liberian capital of Monrovia, Dr', ' Strong and co', ' began by settling permits, route issues, and meeting dignitaries', ' Then, with such logistical concerns settled by the beginning of August and after making brief ventures to collect specimens in the adjacent countryside, they proceeded up the Du river to the first three Firestone Plantations before journeying into the hinterlands that, effectively, were not wholly under the control of the central government', "" The Expedition's goal being Gbarnga - then called Gbanga - (where they intended to and eventually did establish their base camp), they traversed many towns and villages en route"", ' However, while the Expedition encountered and observed many African tribes during and following this stage of their journey, one of their most historically noted meetings occurred in the beginning of September just before they arrived in Gbanga', ' This encounter being with the famed Paramount tribal chief Suah Koko of Suakoko, a formidable woman whose estimated age was 60-70 said was said to be the only female chief in the country', ' Spending a few nights in her domain, the Westerners describe Chief Suah Koko as, despite her age and near blindness, displaying ""surprising  intelligence in her conversation and [that she is] apparently feared, respected, and obeyed in her community', '"" Indeed, while peace currently reigned, the Harvard Expedition noted signs of her previous war with the Liberian Frontier Force in the heavily fortified compound that was her home; a peace that Chief Suah Koko had previously and successfully negotiated with the Liberian government', ' Hence her importance not just in Liberian politics, but also to the Expeditior - for she ruled a strategic region in that it served as a key crossing point into the Liberian hinterlands;
