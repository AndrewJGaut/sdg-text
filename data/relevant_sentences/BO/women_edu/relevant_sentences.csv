in the region, with records of eruptions going back to 1848', ' It is composed of two separate cones with several summit craters', ' The westernmost crater of the eastern cone is presently active', ' Volcanic activity is characterized by constant release of volcanic gas and occasional vulcanian eruptions', '  Lascar has been active since at least 56,000 years ago, though some argue for activity beginning 220,000 years ago', ' The first known activity occurred at the eastern cone and was characterized by lava flows, before shifting to the western cone where lava domes were emplaced', ' An eruption event known as Piedras Grandes was followed by the large Soncor eruption', ' A new western edifice was constructed on top of the Soncor vent, during the Holocene activity then shifted again to the eastern edifice and continues there to this day', ' The magma supplied to the volcano ultimately comes from the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South America Plate', ' A number of other volcanoes are found in the region, such as Aguas Calientes, Cordon de Puntas Negras and the giant La Pacana caldera', '  The volcano experienced at least three major eruptions throughout its history: One is the Soncor eruption about 26,450 ± 500 years ago, another in 7,250 BCE and the third in 1993', ' The first of these eruptions released  of material and is known as the Soncor eruption', ' The largest eruption of Lascar known to recorded history occurred in April 1993 and caused ash fall as far away as Buenos Aires', ' Because Lascar is located in a remote area, it is monitored primarily by remote sensing', ' Explosive eruptions are the greatest hazard at Lascar', '  Lascar, like El Tatio, is a destination for volcano tourism', '  Etymology  The name originates from the Atacameño word láskar or lassi (), thought to refer to the shape of the volcano', ' Other names for the volcano are Hlàscar, Hlascar, Ilascar, Kar Las, Laskar, Toconado and Toconao', '  Geography and geological context  Regional setting  Volcanoes in the Andes occur in four separate regions: the Northern Volcanic Zone between 2°N and 5°S, the Central Volcanic Zone between 16°S and 28°S, the Southern Volcanic Zone between 33°S and 46°S, and the Austral Volcanic Zone, south of the Southern Volcanic Zone', ' These volcanic zones are separated by areas where recent volcanism is absent; one common theory is that the subduction processes responsible for volcanism form a subducting plate that is too shallow to trigger the formation of magma', ' This shallow subduction appears to be triggered by the Nazca Ridge and the Juan Fernandez Ridge; the areas where they subduct beneath the Peru-Chile Trench coincide with the limits of the Central Volcanic Zone', ' It is possible that when these ridges are subducted, the buoyancy they carry disrupts the subduction process and reduces the supply of water, which is important for the formation of melts', '  Of these volcanic zones, the Central Volcanic Zone of which Lascar is a member of is the largest, covering parts of Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile', ' The Central Volcanic Zone is located between two areas where subduction is shallower and volcanic activity is absent', ' In the Central Volcanic Zone, volcanism has been active for 120 million years, although it has undergone eastward migration during this time', ' Water released from the subducting plate triggers the formation of basaltic magmas that are then injected into the crust', '  About 122 volcanoes with Holocene eruptions exist in the Andean Volcanic Belt, including Ojos del Salado which with a height of  is the highest volcano in the world', ' Many of these volcanoes are covered by snow and ice', ' A number of supervolcanoes exist in the Central Volcanic Zone, they are part of the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex', '  Local setting  The volcanism of Lascar relates to the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South America Plate', '

rocks have a pale gray-blue colour, and their composition resembles the Soncor flow, despite more mafic lavas and pyroclastics being erupted in the time period between the emplacement of the Soncor flow and the Capricorn Lava', '  An early pyroclastic flow, the Saltar Flow, is exposed on the eastern flank', "" It was emplaced after the collapse of the oldest edifice, covering Aguas Calientes' western slopes"", ' The flow deposit was later modified by glacial activity', ' The Soncor flow is found primarily on the western side of Lascar, with part of it also southeast of Lascar', ' On the western slope, it buries the even older Piedras Grandes flow, which crops out only at the margins of the Soncor flow', ' While the Piedras Grandes flow was formed by a glacier run that transported blocks with sizes of up to , Soncor was formed by a large eruption', ' The large eruption gave rise to a pyroclastic flow that extended  westward and contained breccia and various magmas', ' It was accompanied by a Plinian fall deposit', ' Finally, the andesitic pumice Tumbres flow is found on the northwest–west–southwestern slopes of Lascar', '  The Quebrada Talabre cuts into the upper flanks

sulfur dioxide in the world among continuously active volcanoes, behind Etna in Italy and Bagana in Papua-New Guinea', ' Since 2014, however, the Peruvian volcanoes Sabancaya and Ubinas have become the largest source of tropospheric sulfur dioxide from the Central Volcanic Zone', ' There are temporal variations in the output: after a decrease in 2009, sulfur output increased in 2012, probably as a consequence of the arrival of new magma at depth', ' There is no clear association between periods of degassing and eruptions', ' Sulfur is released from areas all over the cone, resulting in a

Geography and geological context  Regional setting  Volcanoes in the Andes occur in four separate regions: the Northern Volcanic Zone between 2°N and 5°S, the Central Volcanic Zone between 16°S and 28°S, the Southern Volcanic Zone between 33°S and 46°S, and the Austral Volcanic Zone, south of the Southern Volcanic Zone', ' These volcanic zones are separated by areas where recent volcanism is absent; one common theory is that the subduction processes responsible for volcanism form a subducting plate that is too shallow to trigger the formation of magma', ' This shallow subduction appears to be triggered by the Nazca Ridge and the Juan Fernandez Ridge; the areas where they subduct beneath the Peru-Chile Trench coincide with the limits of the Central Volcanic Zone', ' It is possible that when these ridges are subducted, the buoyancy they carry disrupts the subduction process and reduces the supply of water, which is important for the formation of melts', '  Of these volcanic zones, the Central Volcanic Zone of which Lascar is a member of is the largest, covering parts of Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile', ' The Central Volcanic Zone is located between two areas where subduction is shallower and volcanic activity is absent', ' In the Central Volcanic Zone, volcanism has been active for 120 million years, although it has undergone eastward migration during this time', ' Water released from the subducting plate triggers the formation of basaltic magmas that are then injected into the crust', '  About 122 volcanoes with Holocene eruptions exist in the Andean

absent; one common theory is that the subduction processes responsible for volcanism form a subducting plate that is too shallow to trigger the formation of magma', ' This shallow subduction appears to be triggered by the Nazca Ridge and the Juan Fernandez Ridge; the areas where they subduct beneath the Peru-Chile Trench coincide with the limits of the Central Volcanic Zone', ' It is possible that when these ridges are subducted, the buoyancy they carry disrupts the subduction process and reduces the supply of water, which is important for the formation of melts', '  Of these volcanic

periodically injected into a magma chamber, where crystal fractionation and mixing processes take place', ' The process happens frequently, thus the magmas are relatively unevolved; presumably, if the supply of mafic magma is steady, the products are andesitic, otherwise dacite forms', ' This origin of Lascar magmas is reflected in the textures of rocks', "" Petrologic investigations indicate that

deeper, over  or even over  deep', ' Magma petrology implies that there is another reservoir at  depth', ' There appear to be two distinct chamber systems, an andesitic one that is responsible for the frequent andesite lava and pyroclastic flow activity, and a dacitic one that was involved in the Piedras Grandes and Soncor activities', '  Temperatures of the magma chamber range from ; the mafic magmas that are injected in the chamber are about  hotter than the extant andesite and dacite', ' The chamber may be surrounded by skarnic alteration', ' This alteration gives rise to wollastonite and pyroxene-containing skarn, depending on the distance from the magma chamber walls', ' Metasomatism does further affect rocks derived from magma chamber walls', ' The conditions at the magma chamber may be comparable to these under which epithermal mineral deposits form', ' The oxidation conditions in the magma chamber are favourable for the formation of sulfate, but unfavourable for the deposition of sulfide minerals', ""  A number of xenoliths occur in Lascar's rocks; a large amount of the phenocrysts are ultimately derived from them"", "" Hornfels, skarn, and rocks that are part of

left by this eruption contain basaltic andesite-andesite and were subject to agglutination and welding', ' Originally considered part of stage III, it was more recently attributed to stage IV given the considerable (6,000 years) temporal gap between the Tumbres eruption and stage III volcanism, and the geochemistry of the rocks', ' The Manquez agglutinate above the Tumbres deposits was formed either by the Tumbres eruption or by a subsequent stage; a pyroclastic cone in the western crater may be associated with this agglutinate', '  Activity subsequently shifted to the eastern edifice', ' Around 5150 ± 1250 BCE, as obtained by surface exposure dating, the Tumbres-Talabre lava flow was erupted from the eastern crater', ' This flow extends  northwest and is  thick', ' The Tumbres-Talabre

absent; one common theory is that the subduction processes responsible for volcanism form a subducting plate that is too shallow to trigger the formation of magma', ' This shallow subduction appears to be triggered by the Nazca Ridge and the Juan Fernandez Ridge; the areas where they subduct beneath the Peru-Chile Trench coincide with the limits of the Central Volcanic Zone', ' It is possible that when these ridges are subducted, the buoyancy they carry disrupts the subduction process and reduces the supply of water, which is important for the formation of melts', '  Of these volcanic

frequent andesite lava and pyroclastic flow activity, and a dacitic one that was involved in the Piedras Grandes and Soncor activities', '  Temperatures of the magma chamber range from ; the mafic magmas that are injected in the chamber are about  hotter than the extant andesite and dacite', ' The chamber may be surrounded by skarnic alteration', ' This alteration gives rise to wollastonite and

may be comparable to these under which epithermal mineral deposits form', ' The oxidation conditions in the magma chamber are favourable for the formation of sulfate, but unfavourable for the deposition of sulfide minerals', ""  A number of xenoliths occur in Lascar's rocks; a large amount of the phenocrysts are ultimately derived from them"", "" Hornfels, skarn, and rocks that are part of

magma chamber was located at a floor depth of  (older estimate ) and probably had a complex shape, given certain chemical properties of the Soncor rocks', ' At the time preceding the eruption, the magma chamber had a thermal stratification; injections of mafic magmas had heated the magma chamber and induced convection', '  A volatile phase containing chlorine formed inside the magma chamber and quickly removed most sulfur from the magma', ' This sulfur extraction was facilitated by the high oxygen content of the magma, which allowed the formation of sulfur dioxide', ' Water is a principal

Afterwards, up to four different units of pyroclastic flows, each  thick, formed deposits up to  long', ' At the end of the eruption, a  caldera and the two western craters formed', ' The deposits left by this eruption contain basaltic andesite-andesite and were subject to agglutination and welding', ' Originally considered part of stage III, it was more recently attributed to stage IV given the considerable (6,000 years) temporal gap between the Tumbres eruption and stage III volcanism, and the geochemistry of the rocks', ' The Manquez agglutinate above the Tumbres deposits was formed either by the Tumbres eruption or by a subsequent stage; a pyroclastic cone in the western crater may be associated with this agglutinate', '  Activity subsequently shifted to the eastern edifice', ' Around 5150 ± 1250 BCE, as obtained by surface exposure dating, the Tumbres-Talabre lava flow was erupted from the eastern crater', ' This flow extends  northwest and is  thick', ' The Tumbres-Talabre

in the region, with records of eruptions going back to 1848', ' It is composed of two separate cones with several summit craters', ' The westernmost crater of the eastern cone is presently active', ' Volcanic activity is characterized by constant release of volcanic gas and occasional vulcanian eruptions', '  Lascar has been active since at least 56,000 years ago, though some argue for activity beginning 220,000 years ago', ' The first known activity occurred at the eastern cone and was characterized by lava flows, before shifting to the western cone where lava domes were emplaced', ' An eruption event known as Piedras Grandes was followed by the large Soncor eruption', ' A new western edifice was constructed on top of the Soncor vent, during the Holocene activity then shifted again to the eastern edifice and continues there to this day', ' The magma supplied to the volcano ultimately comes from the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South America Plate', ' A number of other volcanoes are found in the region, such as Aguas Calientes, Cordon de Puntas Negras and the giant La Pacana caldera', '  The volcano experienced at least three major eruptions throughout its history: One is the Soncor eruption about 26,450 ± 500 years ago, another in 7,250 BCE and the third in 1993', ' The first of these eruptions released  of material and is known as the Soncor eruption', ' The largest eruption of Lascar known to recorded history occurred in April 1993 and caused ash fall as far away as Buenos Aires', ' Because Lascar is located in a remote area, it is monitored primarily by remote sensing', ' Explosive eruptions are the greatest hazard at Lascar', '  Lascar, like El Tatio, is a destination for volcano tourism', '  Etymology  The name originates from the Atacameño word láskar or lassi (), thought to refer to the shape of the volcano', ' Other names for the volcano are Hlàscar, Hlascar, Ilascar, Kar Las, Laskar, Toconado and Toconao', '  Geography and geological context  Regional setting  Volcanoes in the Andes occur in four separate regions: the Northern Volcanic Zone between 2°N and 5°S, the Central Volcanic Zone between 16°S and 28°S, the Southern Volcanic Zone between 33°S and 46°S, and the Austral Volcanic Zone, south of the Southern Volcanic Zone', ' These volcanic zones are separated by areas where recent volcanism is absent; one common theory is that the subduction processes responsible for volcanism form a subducting plate that is too shallow to trigger the formation of magma', ' This shallow subduction appears to be triggered by the Nazca Ridge and the Juan Fernandez Ridge; the areas where they subduct beneath the Peru-Chile Trench coincide with the limits of the Central Volcanic Zone', ' It is possible that when these ridges are subducted, the buoyancy they carry disrupts the subduction process and reduces the supply of water, which is important for the formation of melts', '  Of these volcanic zones, the Central Volcanic Zone of which Lascar is a member of is the largest, covering parts of Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile', ' The Central Volcanic Zone is located between two areas where subduction is shallower and volcanic activity is absent', ' In the Central Volcanic Zone, volcanism has been active for 120 million years, although it has undergone eastward migration during this time', ' Water released from the subducting plate triggers the formation of basaltic magmas that are then injected into the crust', '  About 122 volcanoes with Holocene eruptions exist in the Andean Volcanic Belt, including Ojos del Salado which with a height of  is the highest volcano in the world', ' Many of these volcanoes are covered by snow and ice', ' A number of supervolcanoes exist in the

better-researched volcanoes are Galan, Nevados de Payachata, Ollague, Purico Complex, San Pedro–San Pablo, La Pacana, Tata Sabaya and Tumisa', ' Over 44 volcanoes in the region are considered potentially active, with a number of young volcanoes featuring fumarolic or hydrothermal activity', ' Guallatiri, for example, features fumarolic activity that is visible in satellite images', ' Also fumarolically active are: Sabancaya, El Misti, Ubinas, Tacora, Isluga, Irruputuncu, Olca, Ollague, San Pedro, Putana and Lastarria', ' The largest historical eruption occurred at Huaynaputina in

command to remove troops from the front of the 9th Division that defended Alihuatá, leaving the advanced area of the stronghold with only three scattered units', ' Seven hundred men of the Chacaltaya regiment remained entrenched near Arce, riding the road coming from Alihuatá, while the Ballivián regiment was deployed five kilometres to the left, in Campo Grande', ' The Bolivian command deployed a

' Reconnaissance patrols learned of the shortage of personnel and the isolation of the three outposts', ' They surrounded the Bolivian troops through three simultaneous operations', ' On 30 August Paraguayan artillery pounded the trenches of the Chacaltaya regiment, while infantry forces assaulted the flanks', ' A small Bolivian detachment left Alihuatá to bring relief to the Chacaltaya but failed to clear the way', '  Another strong Bolivian detachment, consisting of the 18th Regiment, managed to evict the Paraguayans, cleaning up the rearguard of the Chacaltaya', ' The Paraguayan command, however, was ready to repeat this diversional maneuver', ' General Kundt, who was in the Bullo sector controlling the operation from the barracks at Muñoz, had left specific instructions that the Loa regiment should not be used without his permission', ' Lieutenant Colonel Toro, who was nominally Chief of Operations of the high command but had no authority other than relaying news received from various fronts to Kundt at Muñoz, received a distress message from the 9th Division that said the Chacaltaya was being surrounded again and that the Ballivián regiment also was in danger', ' As Toro was trying to contact Kundt to obtain authorization to deploy the Loa regiment, the situation of the Ballivián and the Chacaltaya was deteriorating', '  Breakout attempt Lieutenant Colonel Toro

situation himself', '  He and Colonel Banzer, Commander of the 9th Division, assumed that the center of gravity of the Paraguayan offensive was the attack against the Chacaltaya regiment, in the path

for reinforcements but Colonel José Capriles, Commander of the Loa who had assumed leadership of the detachment consisting of these two regiments, was opposed', ' The reason was that Colonel Banzer, on the last visit to his command, had notified him that the 9th Division no longer had any reserves and that all available men were going to be used to help the Chacaltaya regiment that was to be defending the road to Arce, which the enemy would se for its main route of attack', "" Colonel Capriles did not encourage them to try an offensive on their own, since he knew that a retreat was the most reasonable course of action before the Paraguayans' encirclement of their forces made it impossible"", ' On the evening of the second day of siege, loud noises of fighting were heard coming from the side of Alihuatá: it was the Zambrana company of the Loa regiment, which was in another sector and had come to the relief of the besieged', ' After half an hour the noise died down; Captain Julio
