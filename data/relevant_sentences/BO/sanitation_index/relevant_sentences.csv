have been estimated to be  for the andesite and  for the basaltic andesite', ' The magmas were formed from a remelted proto-pluton that had been heated and resupplied with volatiles by mafic magmas', '  The lava domes interacted with glaciers, resulting in the formation of a glacier run whose deposits are found as far as  from the volcano', ' Blocks with sizes of up to  were transported by this

Plinian eruption occurred 26,450 ± 500 years ago, releasing  of ejecta, both volcanic ash and pyroclastic flows', ' The deposits left contain both andesite and dacite, with phenocrysts consisting of apatite, augite, biotite, iron-titanium oxides, orthopyroxene and plagioclase in a rhyolite matrix', ' The Plinian deposit has a colour ranging from white to creamy', ' Like the Piedras Grandes rocks,

white, heterogeneous and mostly featureless with only weak sorting, but features a noticeable compositional zonation', ' The ignimbrite features three facies, one rich in breccia, another rich in

the pre-Soncor volcano and the basement are also represented', '  The magma erupted was generated in a magma chamber starting from andesite, which underwent complex petrogenetic processes', ' This magma chamber was located at a floor depth of  (older estimate ) and probably had a complex shape, given certain chemical properties of the Soncor rocks', ' At the time preceding the eruption, the magma chamber had a thermal stratification; injections of mafic magmas had heated the magma chamber and induced convection', '  A volatile phase containing chlorine formed inside the magma chamber and quickly removed most sulfur from the magma', ' This sulfur extraction was facilitated by the high oxygen content of the magma, which allowed the formation of sulfur dioxide', ' Water is a principal volatile involved in the processes of Plinian eruptions; the water content of the Soncor and Piedras Grandes magmas was about 4–5%', ' The Soncor magmas were associated with a volatile phase that underwent extensive interaction with the future eruption products', '  The previous volcanic edifice was destroyed by this eruption, which may have formed a caldera', ' The vent was no wider than , as it is completely hidden beneath the western cone', ' Such a vent or caldera is substantially smaller than the volume of rocks erupted, a discrepancy that is also evident in the 1932 eruption of Quizapu', ' The Soncor magma chamber may have been too deep to collapse when it was emptied, explaining why no significant caldera was formed', '  The Soncor deposit was subsequently affected by glaciation and the stage I edifice by a debris avalanche, which was radiocarbon dated at 22,310 +2,700/−2000 years ago in the Quebrada de Chaile', ' This debris avalanche is  thick and  long', ' The

evidence of stage III activity; indeed Lascar was probably inactive between 14,000 and 10,500 years ago', ' However, an eruption of the Cerro Corona lava dome occurred during this period, and activity of stage III did not commence earlier than 22,300 years ago', '  The Tumbres eruption occurred around 7250 BCE, commencing with the eruption of pumice falls that reach thicknesses of less than ', ' Afterwards, up to four different units of pyroclastic flows, each  thick, formed deposits up to  long', ' At the end of the eruption, a  caldera and the two western craters formed', ' The deposits left by this eruption contain basaltic andesite-andesite and were subject to agglutination and welding', ' Originally considered part of stage III, it was more recently attributed to stage IV given the considerable (6,000 years) temporal gap between the Tumbres eruption and stage III volcanism, and the geochemistry of the rocks', ' The Manquez agglutinate above the Tumbres deposits was formed either by the Tumbres eruption or by a subsequent stage; a pyroclastic cone in the western crater may be associated with this agglutinate', '  Activity subsequently shifted to the eastern edifice', ' Around 5150 ± 1250 BCE, as obtained by surface exposure dating, the Tumbres-Talabre lava flow was erupted from the eastern crater', ' This flow extends  northwest and is  thick', ' The Tumbres-Talabre flow was originally considered to be of late-19th-century age', ' It probably formed when one of the craters filled with andesitic lava to the point of overflow', ' This eruption was the last effusive

Eruptions in 1972 and 1974 are uncertain', ' For some eruptions, including the January 1854 eruption, it is not clear whether they occurred at Lascar or Aguas Calientes, and some early reports of volcanic activity at Aguas Calientes probably refer to Lascar', '  In 1984, Lascar awakened to new activity; satellite images noted the presence of hot spots on the volcano', ' Landsat images taken during this time indicate that a lava lake may have existed in the central crater, generating a plume of volcanic gases and, in September 1986, a vulcanian eruption happened and dropped ash in Salta,

eruption event known as Piedras Grandes was followed by the large Soncor eruption', ' A new western edifice was constructed on top of the Soncor vent, during the Holocene activity then shifted again to the eastern edifice and continues there to this day', ' The magma supplied to the volcano ultimately comes from the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South America Plate', ' A number of

absent; one common theory is that the subduction processes responsible for volcanism form a subducting plate that is too shallow to trigger the formation of magma', ' This shallow subduction appears to be triggered by the Nazca Ridge and the Juan Fernandez Ridge; the areas where they subduct beneath the Peru-Chile Trench coincide with the limits of the Central Volcanic Zone', ' It is possible

Basin to the major load centres of southeastern Brazil', ' The system consists of two converter stations at Porto Velho in the state of Rondônia and Araraquara in São Paulo state, interconnected by two bipolar ±600\xa0kV DC transmission lines with a capacity of  each', ' In addition to the converters for the two bipoles, the Porto Velho converter station also includes two 400\xa0MW back-to-back converters to supply power to the local 230\xa0kV AC system', ' Hence the total export capacity of the Porto Velho station is 7100\xa0MW: 6300\xa0MW from the two bipoles and 800\xa0MW from the two

AC collector grid (Coletora Porto Velho), to the new Rio Madeira hydro plant complex', '  As of January 2013 this consisted of two generating stations: Santo Antônio, close to Porto Velho, with a capacity of 3150\xa0MW, and Jirau, with a capacity of 3750\xa0MW, approximately  away', '  Both generating plants are of the low-head, so-called run of river type in order to minimise the environmental impact of the project', '  They use bulb turbines, which are a type of horizontal-axis Kaplan turbine', '  These have very low inertia compared to other types of hydro-electric generator, and this led to concerns that the turbines could be damaged by over-speed in the event of a sudden interruption to power transmission on the HVDC lines', '   Planning of the transmission system  With such a long transmission distance (2375\xa0km), HVDC would seem to be the natural solution for transporting the generated power to the load centres of south-east Brazil, but a very comprehensive techno-economic analysis was nevertheless performed to evaluate the relative benefits of various different solutions', '  A total of 16 options were initially examined, including three all-DC options at 500\xa0kV, 600\xa0kV and 800\xa0kV, as well as several all-AC options and hybrid DC+AC options', '  In the end it was concluded that DC, at a transmission voltage of 600\xa0kV (the

put forward for the final selection:  All-DC option:  Two ±600\xa0kV, 3150\xa0MW transmission bipoles, plus two 400\xa0MW back to back converters  Hybrid AC+DC option:  One ±600\xa0kV, 3150\xa0MW

±600\xa0kV all-DC option', ' This option was divided into seven separate packages, referred to as Lots 1–7:  Lot 1: Porto Velho 500\xa0kV AC substation plus two 400\xa0MW back-to-back converters  Lot

thyristors', '  Both converter stations of Bipole 2 and the Araraquara converter station of Bipole 1 use single-phase, two-winding converter transformers with the thyristor valves arranged in double-valves, but the Porto Velho Bipole 1 converter station used single-phase three-winding converter transformers (because the river made the transport of larger transformers feasible than was the case at Araraquara) and valves arranged in quadrivalves', '  Because the 230\xa0kV network in Rondônia and Acre is very weak, the back-to-back converters are implemented as Capacitor Commutated Converters (CCC)', '  The thyristor valves being much smaller than those of the transmission bipoles, it was possible to arrange each back-to-back converter as just three valve stacks of eight valves each (octovalves)', '  The design of certain aspects of the two bipoles (which were supplied by different manufacturers) needed to be coordinated in order to avoid adverse control interactions or harmonic filtering problems', ' In addition, a considerable number of different operating modes needed to be taken into account, such as paralleling the converters of both bipoles onto a single transmission line', '  There is also a requirement for power flow in the south–north direction, although only at a reduced level', '  These aspects, along with the complex structure of the project with multiple engineering companies involved at the same time, led to some delays in the project', '   References   External links   ABB commissions world’s longest power transmission link in Brazil

Basin to the major load centres of southeastern Brazil', ' The system consists of two converter stations at Porto Velho in the state of Rondônia and Araraquara in São Paulo state, interconnected by two bipolar ±600\xa0kV DC transmission lines with a capacity of  each', ' In addition to the converters for the two bipoles, the Porto Velho converter station also includes two 400\xa0MW back-to-back converters to supply power to the local 230\xa0kV AC system', ' Hence the total export capacity of the Porto Velho station is 7100\xa0MW: 6300\xa0MW from the two bipoles and 800\xa0MW from the two back-to-back converters', ' When Bipole 1 commenced commercial operation in 2014, Rio Madeira became the world’s longest HVDC line, surpassing the Xiangjiaba–Shanghai system in China', ' According to

AC collector grid (Coletora Porto Velho), to the new Rio Madeira hydro plant complex', '  As of January 2013 this consisted of two generating stations: Santo Antônio, close to Porto Velho, with a capacity of 3150\xa0MW, and Jirau, with a capacity of 3750\xa0MW, approximately  away', '  Both generating plants are of the low-head, so-called run of river type in order to minimise the environmental impact of the project', '  They use bulb turbines, which are a type of horizontal-axis Kaplan turbine', '  These have very low inertia compared to other types of hydro-electric generator, and this led to concerns that the turbines could be damaged by over-speed in the event of a sudden interruption to power transmission on the HVDC lines', '   Planning of the transmission system  With such a long transmission distance (2375\xa0km), HVDC would seem to be the natural solution for transporting the generated power to the load centres of south-east Brazil, but a very comprehensive techno-economic analysis was nevertheless performed to evaluate the relative benefits of various different solutions', '  A total of 16 options were initially examined, including three all-DC options at 500\xa0kV, 600\xa0kV and 800\xa0kV, as well as several all-AC options and hybrid DC+AC options', '  In the end it was concluded that DC, at a transmission voltage of 600\xa0kV (the

put forward for the final selection:  All-DC option:  Two ±600\xa0kV, 3150\xa0MW transmission bipoles, plus two 400\xa0MW back to back converters  Hybrid AC+DC option:  One ±600\xa0kV, 3150\xa0MW

±600\xa0kV all-DC option', ' This option was divided into seven separate packages, referred to as Lots 1–7:  Lot 1: Porto Velho 500\xa0kV AC substation plus two 400\xa0MW back-to-back converters  Lot

thyristors', '  Both converter stations of Bipole 2 and the Araraquara converter station of Bipole 1 use single-phase, two-winding converter transformers with the thyristor valves arranged in double-valves, but the Porto Velho Bipole 1 converter station used single-phase three-winding converter transformers (because the river made the transport of larger transformers feasible than was the case at Araraquara) and valves arranged in quadrivalves', '  Because the 230\xa0kV network in Rondônia and Acre is very weak, the back-to-back converters are implemented as Capacitor Commutated Converters (CCC)', '  The thyristor valves being much smaller than those of the transmission bipoles, it was possible to arrange each back-to-back converter as just three valve stacks of eight valves each (octovalves)', '  The design of certain aspects of the two bipoles (which were supplied by different manufacturers) needed to be coordinated in order to avoid adverse control interactions or harmonic filtering problems', ' In addition, a considerable number of different operating modes needed to be taken into account, such as paralleling the converters of both bipoles onto a single transmission line', '  There is also a requirement for power flow in the south–north direction, although only at a reduced level', '  These aspects, along with the complex structure of the project with multiple engineering companies involved at the same time, led to some delays in the project', '   References   External links   ABB commissions world’s longest power transmission link in Brazil

with these of Galan and La Pacana and are linked to the domain of the crust they are constructed on', '  There are some compositional variations in various stages of volcanism at Cerro Panizos', ' The Cienago ignimbrite is a highly evolved magma', ' Magmas from the Panizos ignimbrite display only weak variations that may be linked to temperature differences in the magma chamber', ' The magmas of the Panizos ignimbrite underwent strong crystallization between eruptions and crystals are often heavily modified', ' The formation of all magmas was initiated by the interaction of mafic mantle melts with the crust', ' The mantle component is up to 50% of the main Panizos ignimbrite', '  A notable feature of Cerro Panizos is the presence of so-called orbs, which are rocks with concentric layers of igneous material surrounding them', ' They are known from plutonic rocks, but orbs in erupted magmas are only known from Akagi volcano, Japan', ' In Panizos they are found in the upper part of the lower cooling unit of the Cerro Panizos ignimbrite and are associated with pumice and megacrysts in the surrounding rock', ' Buried within the ignimbrites and lavas, some orbs contain layers of biotite, bronzite, ilmenite and plagioclase around a centimetre-sized xenolith or orthopyroxene core', ' The layering is not disturbed by irregular shapes of the cores', ' These orbs most likely formed from material crystallizing around pre-existent cores during rapid changes in magma temperature that occurred shortly before the end of the first phase of the Cerro Panizos eruption through changes in magma water content', ' Opening of ring vents then delivered the orb-containing magma to the surface', '   Climate and hydrography  Panizos has an arid climate, although some stream erosion is visible', ' Some stream valleys are known, clockwise from northeast, as Quebrada Buenos Aires, Quebrada Cienago, Quebrada Paicone Quebrada Pupusayo, Quebrada Cusi Cusi, Quebrada Cuevas and Quebrada Garcia', ' The dissection is particularly pronounced on the Argentine side of the complex', '  Oxygen isotopic analysis of magmas from other APVC centres support the notion that the area of the APVC has been subject to arid climate for the duration of its active phase', '   Eruptive history  Two ignimbrite eruptions have taken place in Panizos', ' A number of lava flows also formed', ' Volcanic activity took place in the Late Miocene', ' The main Cerro Panizos ignimbrite lies on top three older ignimbrite layers', ' Potassium-argon dating has yielded ages of 9', '7 ± 0', '4, 8', '49 ± 0', '2

years old and has been associated with the Panizos centre', ' The first recorded ignimbrite in the area is named Quebrada Cienago ignimbrite after the valley where it is exposed', ' It contains biotite quartz dacite and is formed from four units, two ashfall deposits and two ignimbrite flows', ' Some of these have undergone reworking', ' It was emplaced 7', '9 mya', ' After the emplacement of the Cienago ignimbrite, eruption of dacite lava flows continued', '  Erupted 6', '71 ± 0', '04 mya, the Panizos ignimbrite proper is a complex structure with several cooling units and an interlayered pyroclastic deposit, which contains pumice, sandstone boulders up to two metres thick and has carved channels into the lower unit', ' At the edge of the plateau the upper and lower cooling units are  and  thick', ' In the plateau centre, the lower unit is completely hidden beneath the now more than  thick upper unit', ' The lower unit begins with one metre of lapilli and above it thick ignimbrite layers that become increasingly non-welded farther up with vapour phase components appearing', ' There was no prior Plinian fallout', ' Orbs and two differently coloured pumices are located in the upper section of the lower unit, with some xenoliths', ' The upper cooling unit contains two types of pumice, one strongly welded and the other weakly so, and is much richer in lithic fragments', ' The upper unit was erupted in several discrete flows from the central complex', ' Some pumice fall layers are embedded in the upper unit', '  Based on the structure, the main Panizos ignimbrite was probably erupted in a steady eruption at first, from either one vent or several smaller ones in close association', ' Either a column collapse or a change in vent geometries triggered a temporary pause which separates the upper and lower cooling units', ' After a short timespan, the eruption restarted, this time through several eruption flows and a more unsteady regimen with a lower flow rate', ' Based on welding patterns, the eruption commenced in the southern sector later covered by lava domes and migrated northward', ' Calculations indicate that the main Panizos ignimbrite has minimum volumina of  outside of the calderas and  dense rock equivalent', ' This ignimbrite flow was of comparatively low fluidity, likely due to its high crystal content', ' The amount of vesicles present in the lower cooling unit is inferior to 20% of volume', '  Above the Panizos ignimbrite, a lava flow platform and a set of lava domes were emplaced', ' A last manifestation is the Cerro La Ramada lava flow, with an age of 6', '1 mya', ' A tephra layer found in the Coastal Cordillera and dated 6', '66 ± 0', '13 mya may also be linked to the Panizos complex', ' The much younger

two bipolar ±600\xa0kV DC transmission lines with a capacity of  each', ' In addition to the converters for the two bipoles, the Porto Velho converter station also includes two 400\xa0MW back-to-back converters to supply power to the local 230\xa0kV AC system', ' Hence the total export capacity of the Porto Velho station is 7100\xa0MW: 6300\xa0MW from the two bipoles and 800\xa0MW from the two

capacity of 3150\xa0MW, and Jirau, with a capacity of 3750\xa0MW, approximately  away', '  Both generating plants are of the low-head, so-called run of river type in order to minimise the environmental impact of the project', '  They use bulb turbines, which are a type of horizontal-axis Kaplan turbine', '  These have very low inertia compared to other types of hydro-electric generator, and this led to concerns that the turbines could be damaged by over-speed in the event of a sudden interruption to power transmission on the HVDC lines', '   Planning of the transmission system  With such a long transmission distance (2375\xa0km), HVDC would seem to be the natural solution for transporting the generated power to the load centres of south-east Brazil, but a very comprehensive techno-economic analysis was nevertheless performed to evaluate the relative benefits of various different solutions', '  A total of 16 options were initially examined, including three all-DC options at 500\xa0kV, 600\xa0kV and 800\xa0kV, as well as several all-AC options and hybrid DC+AC options', '  In the end it was concluded that DC, at a transmission voltage of 600\xa0kV (the

put forward for the final selection:  All-DC option:  Two ±600\xa0kV, 3150\xa0MW transmission bipoles, plus two 400\xa0MW back to back converters  Hybrid AC+DC option:  One ±600\xa0kV, 3150\xa0MW

±600\xa0kV all-DC option', ' This option was divided into seven separate packages, referred to as Lots 1–7:  Lot 1: Porto Velho 500\xa0kV AC substation plus two 400\xa0MW back-to-back converters  Lot

thyristors', '  Both converter stations of Bipole 2 and the Araraquara converter station of Bipole 1 use single-phase, two-winding converter transformers with the thyristor valves arranged in double-valves, but the Porto Velho Bipole 1 converter station used single-phase three-winding converter transformers (because the river made the transport of larger transformers feasible than was the case at Araraquara) and valves arranged in quadrivalves', '  Because the 230\xa0kV network in Rondônia and Acre is very weak, the back-to-back converters are implemented as Capacitor Commutated Converters (CCC)', '  The thyristor valves being much smaller than those of the transmission bipoles, it was possible to arrange each back-to-back converter as just three valve stacks of eight valves each (octovalves)', '  The design of certain aspects of the two bipoles (which were supplied by different manufacturers) needed to be coordinated in order to avoid adverse control interactions or harmonic filtering problems', ' In addition, a considerable number of different operating modes needed to be taken into account, such as paralleling the converters of both bipoles onto a single transmission line', '  There is also a requirement for power flow in the south–north direction, although only at a reduced level', '  These aspects, along with the complex structure of the project with multiple engineering companies involved at the same time, led to some delays in the project', '   References   External links   ABB commissions world’s longest power transmission link in Brazil

the topography of the northwestern side of the volcano may have prevented the mass failure from being localized along the basement-edifice surface area, explaining the large volume of basement involved', ' Further, the basement-derived material was probably mechanically weak and thus allowed the landslide to move over shallow slopes', ' This basement material forms part of the white surfaces in the landslide deposit;

the topography of the northwestern side of the volcano may have prevented the mass failure from being localized along the basement-edifice surface area, explaining the large volume of basement involved', ' Further, the basement-derived material was probably mechanically weak and thus allowed the landslide to move over shallow slopes', ' This basement material forms part of the white surfaces in the landslide deposit;

double-valves, but the Porto Velho Bipole 1 converter station used single-phase three-winding converter transformers (because the river made the transport of larger transformers feasible than was the case at Araraquara) and valves arranged in quadrivalves', '  Because the 230\xa0kV network in Rondônia and Acre is very weak, the back-to-back converters are implemented as Capacitor Commutated Converters (CCC)', '  The thyristor valves being much smaller than those of the transmission bipoles, it was possible to arrange each back-to-back converter as just three valve stacks of eight valves each (octovalves)', '  The design of certain aspects of the two bipoles (which were supplied by different manufacturers) needed to be coordinated in order to avoid adverse control interactions or harmonic filtering problems', ' In addition, a considerable number of different operating modes needed to be taken into account, such as paralleling the converters of both bipoles onto a single transmission line', '  There is also a requirement for power flow in the south–north direction, although only at a reduced level', '  These aspects, along with the complex structure of the project

desirable to start the cropping season in August/September, so that an early harvest can be obtained', ' The early harvest has a high market value and reduces peak labor requirements', ' Further, the irrigation reduces the risk of crop failure and it permits diversification of agricultural produce', ' Nevertheless, there are some farming communities that have refrained in the past from the extra effort to obtain additional irrigation water and who seemed to be content with purely rain-fed cropping', '  At a modest scale, irrigation from deep-wells is also practiced', '  In order to satisfy the needs of the majority of the farmers who strongly wish to have additional irrigation water, the irrigation project Punata-Tiraque began to be developed from 1970 onwards', ' The project entailed the construction of a complicated system of dams and reservoirs up in the Andean mountains (Fig', ' P2)', '  The gross area of the Punata projects is estimated at 4600 ha, 90% of which can be used for agriculture or animal husbandry', ' About 1150 ha of this presently receive irrigation water, either surface water derived from the Laguna Robada or Lluska Kocha dam, or water pumped from the 16 deep wells in the project area (estimated at 350 ha)', ' In addition there are a few hundred hectares that receive occasional water from mita irrigation (wild flooding)', '  The traditional irrigation method is based on handling large irrigation flows (golpes) per farm at large intervals', ' The intake structures in the Pucara Mayu river, at the place where it enters the alluvial fan of Punata, would alternately pass water from each of the reservoir systems (Laguna Robada and Lluska Kocha / Muyu Loma) and the natural mita water', ' The new system has been designed for smaller flows with shorter rotation intervals, but it works continuously for the whole area, so that there is no need anymore to separate the various sources of water', ' It covers a much larger area than the traditional system and it incorporates the associations of the mita systems (which may have partly the same members), the associations of tube-well systems (which may also have partly the same members) as well as the persons who had no previous water rights', '  Hence, the new irrigation system makes it necessary to replace the traditional water rights by a totally new set of rights (and duties)', ' In addition, the farmers will have to get used to new water distribution methods and new field irrigation techniques', ' Because the new irrigation zones do not correspond to the boundaries of the existing, scattered, Comité’s de Riego (Fig', ' P3), not only the water management but also the organizational structure will have to be adjusted to the new situation', ""  See also

Basin to the major load centres of southeastern Brazil', ' The system consists of two converter stations at Porto Velho in the state of Rondônia and Araraquara in São Paulo state, interconnected by two bipolar ±600\xa0kV DC transmission lines with a capacity of  each', ' In addition to the converters for the two bipoles, the Porto Velho converter station also includes two 400\xa0MW back-to-back converters to supply power to the local 230\xa0kV AC system', ' Hence the total export capacity of the Porto Velho station is 7100\xa0MW: 6300\xa0MW from the two bipoles and 800\xa0MW from the two back-to-back converters', ' When Bipole 1 commenced commercial operation in 2014, Rio Madeira became the world’s longest HVDC line, surpassing the Xiangjiaba–Shanghai system in China', ' According to

AC collector grid (Coletora Porto Velho), to the new Rio Madeira hydro plant complex', '  As of January 2013 this consisted of two generating stations: Santo Antônio, close to Porto Velho, with a capacity of 3150\xa0MW, and Jirau, with a capacity of 3750\xa0MW, approximately  away', '  Both generating plants are of the low-head, so-called run of river type in order to minimise the environmental impact of the project', '  They use bulb turbines, which are a type of horizontal-axis Kaplan turbine', '  These have very low inertia compared to other types of hydro-electric generator, and this led to concerns that the turbines could be damaged by over-speed in the event of a sudden interruption to power transmission on the HVDC lines', '   Planning of the transmission system  With such a long transmission distance (2375\xa0km), HVDC would seem to be the natural solution for transporting the generated power to the load centres of south-east Brazil, but a very comprehensive techno-economic analysis was nevertheless performed to evaluate the relative benefits of various different solutions', '  A total of 16 options were initially examined, including three all-DC options at 500\xa0kV, 600\xa0kV and 800\xa0kV, as well as several all-AC options and hybrid DC+AC options', '  In the end it was concluded that DC, at a transmission voltage of 600\xa0kV (the

put forward for the final selection:  All-DC option:  Two ±600\xa0kV, 3150\xa0MW transmission bipoles, plus two 400\xa0MW back to back converters  Hybrid AC+DC option:  One ±600\xa0kV, 3150\xa0MW

±600\xa0kV all-DC option', ' This option was divided into seven separate packages, referred to as Lots 1–7:  Lot 1: Porto Velho 500\xa0kV AC substation plus two 400\xa0MW back-to-back converters  Lot

thyristors', '  Both converter stations of Bipole 2 and the Araraquara converter station of Bipole 1 use single-phase, two-winding converter transformers with the thyristor valves arranged in double-valves, but the Porto Velho Bipole 1 converter station used single-phase three-winding converter transformers (because the river made the transport of larger transformers feasible than was the case at Araraquara) and valves arranged in quadrivalves', '  Because the 230\xa0kV network in Rondônia and Acre is very weak, the back-to-back converters are implemented as Capacitor Commutated Converters (CCC)', '  The thyristor valves being much smaller than those of the transmission bipoles, it was possible to arrange each back-to-back converter as just three valve stacks of eight valves each (octovalves)', '  The design of certain aspects of the two bipoles (which were supplied by different manufacturers) needed to be coordinated in order to avoid adverse control interactions or harmonic filtering problems', ' In addition, a considerable number of different operating modes needed to be taken into account, such as paralleling the converters of both bipoles onto a single transmission line', '  There is also a requirement for power flow in the south–north direction, although only at a reduced level', '  These aspects, along with the complex structure of the project with multiple engineering companies involved at the same time, led to some delays in the project', '   References   External links   ABB commissions world’s longest power transmission link in Brazil

with these of Galan and La Pacana and are linked to the domain of the crust they are constructed on', '  There are some compositional variations in various stages of volcanism at Cerro Panizos', ' The Cienago ignimbrite is a highly evolved magma', ' Magmas from the Panizos ignimbrite display only weak variations that may be linked to temperature differences in the magma chamber', ' The magmas of the Panizos ignimbrite underwent strong crystallization between eruptions and crystals are often heavily modified', ' The formation of all magmas was initiated by the interaction of mafic mantle melts with the crust', ' The mantle component is up to 50% of the main Panizos ignimbrite', '  A notable feature of Cerro Panizos is the presence of so-called orbs, which are rocks with concentric layers of igneous material surrounding them', ' They are known from plutonic rocks, but orbs in erupted magmas are only known from Akagi volcano, Japan', ' In Panizos they are found in the upper part of the lower cooling unit of the Cerro Panizos ignimbrite and are associated with pumice and megacrysts in the surrounding rock', ' Buried within the ignimbrites and lavas, some orbs contain layers of biotite, bronzite, ilmenite and plagioclase around a centimetre-sized xenolith or orthopyroxene core', ' The layering is not disturbed by irregular shapes of the cores', ' These orbs most likely formed from material crystallizing around pre-existent cores during rapid changes in magma temperature that occurred shortly before the end of the first phase of the Cerro Panizos eruption through changes in magma water content', ' Opening of ring vents then delivered the orb-containing magma to the surface', '   Climate and hydrography  Panizos has an arid climate, although some stream erosion is visible', ' Some stream valleys are known, clockwise from northeast, as Quebrada Buenos Aires, Quebrada Cienago, Quebrada Paicone Quebrada Pupusayo, Quebrada Cusi Cusi, Quebrada Cuevas and Quebrada Garcia', ' The dissection is particularly pronounced on the Argentine side of the complex', '  Oxygen isotopic analysis of magmas from other APVC centres support the notion that the area of the APVC has been subject to arid climate for the duration of its active phase', '   Eruptive history  Two ignimbrite eruptions have taken place in Panizos', ' A number of lava flows also formed', ' Volcanic

biotite quartz dacite and is formed from four units, two ashfall deposits and two ignimbrite flows', ' Some of these have undergone reworking', ' It was emplaced 7', '9 mya', ' After the emplacement

cooling units are  and  thick', ' In the plateau centre, the lower unit is completely hidden beneath the now more than  thick upper unit', ' The lower unit begins with one metre of lapilli and above it thick ignimbrite layers that become increasingly non-welded farther up with vapour phase components appearing', ' There was no prior Plinian fallout', ' Orbs and two differently coloured pumices are located in the upper section of the lower unit, with some xenoliths', ' The upper cooling unit contains two types of pumice, one strongly welded and the other weakly so, and is much richer in lithic fragments', ' The upper unit was erupted in several discrete flows from the central complex', ' Some pumice fall layers are embedded in the upper unit', '  Based on the structure, the main Panizos ignimbrite was probably erupted in a steady eruption at first, from either one vent or several smaller ones in close association', ' Either a column collapse or a change in vent geometries triggered a temporary pause which separates the upper and lower cooling units', ' After a short timespan, the eruption restarted, this time through several eruption flows and a more unsteady regimen with a lower flow rate', ' Based on welding patterns, the eruption commenced in the southern sector later covered by lava domes and migrated northward', ' Calculations indicate that the main Panizos ignimbrite has minimum volumina of  outside of the calderas and  dense rock equivalent', ' This ignimbrite flow was of comparatively low fluidity, likely due to its high crystal content', ' The amount of vesicles present in the lower cooling unit is inferior to 20% of volume', '  Above the Panizos ignimbrite, a lava flow platform and a set of lava domes were emplaced', ' A last manifestation is the

desirable to start the cropping season in August/September, so that an early harvest can be obtained', ' The early harvest has a high market value and reduces peak labor requirements', ' Further, the irrigation reduces the risk of crop failure and it permits diversification of agricultural produce', ' Nevertheless, there are some farming communities that have refrained in the past from the extra effort to obtain additional irrigation water and who seemed to be content with purely rain-fed cropping', '  At a modest scale, irrigation from deep-wells is also practiced', '  In order to satisfy the needs of the majority of the farmers who strongly wish to have additional irrigation water, the irrigation project Punata-Tiraque began to be developed from 1970 onwards', ' The project entailed the construction of a complicated system of dams and reservoirs up in the Andean mountains (Fig', ' P2)', '  The gross area of the Punata projects is estimated at 4600 ha, 90% of which can be used for agriculture or animal husbandry', ' About 1150 ha of this presently receive irrigation water, either surface water derived from the Laguna Robada or Lluska Kocha dam, or water pumped from the 16 deep wells in the project area (estimated at 350 ha)', ' In addition there are a few hundred hectares that receive occasional water from mita irrigation (wild flooding)', '  The traditional irrigation method is based on handling large irrigation flows (golpes) per farm at large intervals', ' The intake structures in the Pucara Mayu river, at the place where it enters the alluvial fan of Punata, would alternately pass water from each of the reservoir systems (Laguna Robada and Lluska Kocha / Muyu Loma) and the natural mita water', ' The new system has been designed for smaller flows with shorter rotation intervals, but it works continuously for the whole area, so that there is no need anymore to separate the various sources of water', ' It covers a much larger area than the traditional system and it incorporates the associations of the mita systems (which may have partly the same members), the associations of tube-well systems (which may also have partly the same members) as well as the persons who had no previous water rights', '  Hence, the new irrigation system makes it necessary to replace the traditional water rights by a totally new set of rights (and duties)', ' In addition, the farmers will have to get used to new water distribution methods and new field irrigation techniques', ' Because the new irrigation zones do not correspond to the boundaries of the existing, scattered, Comité’s de Riego (Fig', ' P3), not only the water management but also the organizational structure will have to be adjusted to the new situation', ""  See also

Basin to the major load centres of southeastern Brazil', ' The system consists of two converter stations at Porto Velho in the state of Rondônia and Araraquara in São Paulo state, interconnected by two bipolar ±600\xa0kV DC transmission lines with a capacity of  each', ' In addition to the converters for the two bipoles, the Porto Velho converter station also includes two 400\xa0MW back-to-back converters to supply power to the local 230\xa0kV AC system', ' Hence the total export capacity of the Porto Velho station is 7100\xa0MW: 6300\xa0MW from the two bipoles and 800\xa0MW from the two back-to-back converters', ' When Bipole 1 commenced commercial operation in 2014, Rio Madeira became the world’s longest HVDC line, surpassing the Xiangjiaba–Shanghai system in China', ' According to

AC collector grid (Coletora Porto Velho), to the new Rio Madeira hydro plant complex', '  As of January 2013 this consisted of two generating stations: Santo Antônio, close to Porto Velho, with a capacity of 3150\xa0MW, and Jirau, with a capacity of 3750\xa0MW, approximately  away', '  Both generating plants are of the low-head, so-called run of river type in order to minimise the environmental impact of the project', '  They use bulb turbines, which are a type of horizontal-axis Kaplan turbine', '  These have very low inertia compared to other types of hydro-electric generator, and this led to concerns that the turbines could be damaged by over-speed in the event of a sudden interruption to power transmission on the HVDC lines', '   Planning of the transmission system  With such a long transmission distance (2375\xa0km), HVDC would seem to be the natural solution for transporting the generated power to the load centres of south-east Brazil, but a very comprehensive techno-economic analysis was nevertheless performed to evaluate the relative benefits of various different solutions', '  A total of 16 options were initially examined, including three all-DC options at 500\xa0kV, 600\xa0kV and 800\xa0kV, as well as several all-AC options and hybrid DC+AC options', '  In the end it was concluded that DC, at a transmission voltage of 600\xa0kV (the

put forward for the final selection:  All-DC option:  Two ±600\xa0kV, 3150\xa0MW transmission bipoles, plus two 400\xa0MW back to back converters  Hybrid AC+DC option:  One ±600\xa0kV, 3150\xa0MW

±600\xa0kV all-DC option', ' This option was divided into seven separate packages, referred to as Lots 1–7:  Lot 1: Porto Velho 500\xa0kV AC substation plus two 400\xa0MW back-to-back converters  Lot

thyristors', '  Both converter stations of Bipole 2 and the Araraquara converter station of Bipole 1 use single-phase, two-winding converter transformers with the thyristor valves arranged in double-valves, but the Porto Velho Bipole 1 converter station used single-phase three-winding converter transformers (because the river made the transport of larger transformers feasible than was the case at Araraquara) and valves arranged in quadrivalves', '  Because the 230\xa0kV network in Rondônia and Acre is very weak, the back-to-back converters are implemented as Capacitor Commutated Converters (CCC)', '  The thyristor valves being much smaller than those of the transmission bipoles, it was possible to arrange each back-to-back converter as just three valve stacks of eight valves each (octovalves)', '  The design of certain aspects of the two bipoles (which were supplied by different manufacturers) needed to be coordinated in order to avoid adverse control interactions or harmonic filtering problems', ' In addition, a considerable number of different operating modes needed to be taken into account, such as paralleling the converters of both bipoles onto a single transmission line', '  There is also a requirement for power flow in the south–north direction, although only at a reduced level', '  These aspects, along with the complex structure of the project with multiple engineering companies involved at the same time, led to some delays in the project', '   References   External links   ABB commissions world’s longest power transmission link in Brazil

case at Araraquara) and valves arranged in quadrivalves', '  Because the 230\xa0kV network in Rondônia and Acre is very weak, the back-to-back converters are implemented as Capacitor Commutated Converters (CCC)', '  The thyristor valves being much smaller than those of the transmission bipoles, it was possible to arrange each back-to-back converter as just three valve stacks of eight valves each (octovalves)', '  The design of certain aspects of the two bipoles (which were supplied by different manufacturers) needed to be coordinated in order to avoid adverse control interactions or harmonic filtering problems', ' In addition, a considerable number of different operating modes needed to be taken into account, such as paralleling the converters of both bipoles onto a single transmission line', '  There is also a requirement for power flow in the south–north direction, although only at a reduced level', '  These aspects, along with the complex structure of the project

supply of mafic magma is steady, the products are andesitic, otherwise dacite forms', ' This origin of Lascar magmas is reflected in the textures of rocks', "" Petrologic investigations indicate that at least three components give rise to Lascar's magmas, an upper crustal one, a mantle component and an enriched component that may come either from the lower crust or the downgoing slab"", ' The overall magma supply rate of Lascar is ', '  The magma chamber of Lascar appears to lie at depths of , although the lack of deformation of the edifice during the 1993 eruption indicates that it may be

frequent andesite lava and pyroclastic flow activity, and a dacitic one that was involved in the Piedras Grandes and Soncor activities', '  Temperatures of the magma chamber range from ; the mafic magmas that are injected in the chamber are about  hotter than the extant andesite and dacite', ' The chamber may be surrounded by skarnic alteration', ' This alteration gives rise to wollastonite and pyroxene-containing skarn, depending on the distance from the magma chamber walls', ' Metasomatism does further affect rocks derived from magma chamber walls', ' The conditions at the magma chamber may be comparable to these under which epithermal mineral deposits form', ' The oxidation conditions in the magma chamber are favourable for the formation of sulfate, but unfavourable for the deposition of sulfide minerals', ""  A number of xenoliths occur in Lascar's rocks; a large amount of the phenocrysts are ultimately derived from them"", "" Hornfels, skarn, and rocks that are part of Lascar's lava dome ridge are the source of these xenoliths"", ' Minerals encountered in xenoliths include andradite, anhydrite, anorthite, apatite, biotite, calcite, diopside, fassaite, garnet, gypsum, ilmenite, magnetite, monazite, orthopyroxene, perovskite, plagioclase, prehnite, quartz, sphene, thorite, wilkeite, wollastonite and zircon', ' A number of such xenoliths formed from carbonate rocks that were influenced by magma of Lascar and of other volcanoes such as Tumisa', '  Gas emissions  Lascar emits plumes of gas and white clouds of condensed water vapor, mostly over many hundreds of fumarolic vents, which are chiefly located in the active crater', ' In December 2002, two fumaroles had temperatures exceeding ', ' Total flux is estimated to be , and occurs even between eruptions', '   There are high-temperature fumaroles (temperatures equal to or exceeding ) and low-temperature fumaroles (temperatures of less than ), with noticeable chemical differences between the two; the latter tend to emit far more water than carbon dioxide', ' The fumaroles also release carbon monoxide, hydrogen, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen sulfide, and smaller amounts of helium', ' Hydrocarbons and other organic compounds are also found in the low-temperature fumaroles', ' Trace elements include arsenic, boron and titanium, with smaller amounts of barium, chromium, copper, lead,

atmosphere around 30° south, reaching a proportion of 20–40% the sulfur over South America and still 10–20% over the South Indian Ocean', ' In 2005, Lascar was the third-largest source of volcanic sulfur dioxide in the world among continuously active volcanoes, behind Etna in Italy and Bagana in Papua-New Guinea', ' Since 2014, however, the Peruvian volcanoes Sabancaya and Ubinas have become the largest source of tropospheric sulfur dioxide from the Central Volcanic Zone', ' There are temporal variations in the output: after a decrease in 2009, sulfur output increased in 2012, probably as a consequence of the arrival of new magma at depth', ' There is no clear association between periods of degassing and eruptions', ' Sulfur is released from areas all over the cone, resulting in a noticeable sulfur smell', '  Hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride are also released in large amounts, with estimates made in 2003–2004 indicating a mass flux of  and  respectively', ' They correspond to about 2 and 5%, respectively, of the global volcanic flux of these compounds', ' Finally, Lascar is vigorous producer of sulfate dust particles, which are released at a rate of about

release of gas by the magma is favoured by strong temperature contrasts between incoming magma and the magma chamber, and processes occurring during the mixing may explain the high emission of sulfur dioxide by Lascar', ' The presence of argon and nitrogen in low-temperature fumaroles indicates that air is involved in their formation, although a portion of each of these two gases is non-atmospheric', '  Sulfur and chlorine may be derived from the crust, evaporites such as these found at Salar de Atacama, subducted lithosphere or the mantle', ' Carbon in the gases may come from skarn assimilation', "" Sulfur isotope data support the notion that evaporite deposits contribute part of Lascar's sulfur"", ' Water appears to be in part magmatic and in part precipitation-derived',

flow', ' Imprecise argon–argon dating on younger andesites has yielded dates of 14,000 ± 18,000 and 17,000 ± 22,000 years', '  Later volcanic activity buried this edifice beneath thin pyroclastic flows', ' The western edifice generated a complex of lava domes (stage II), which was probably surrounded by a horseshoe-shaped crater open to the west', ' Possibly, the magma chamber of stage I had almost solidified when the injection of basaltic magma at depths of over  triggered a remelting', ' Andesite-rhyodacite intrusions occurred beneath the volcano, some of which were still hot when the

the considerable (6,000 years) temporal gap between the Tumbres eruption and stage III volcanism, and the geochemistry of the rocks', ' The Manquez agglutinate above the Tumbres deposits was formed either by the Tumbres eruption or by a subsequent stage; a pyroclastic cone in the western crater may be associated with this agglutinate', '  Activity subsequently shifted to the eastern edifice', '

one of the ignimbrites, the San Pedro Ignimbrite, may have originated from a vent now covered by San Pedro volcano although the neighbouring Caracanal volcano is also a candidate source', ' The older composite volcano centres include Cerro Carcanal and Cerro Huiche south-southeast of San Pedro and Cerro del Diablo due north', ' This surface slopes down to the Loa River in the west', '   Composition   Old Cone lavas range from andesite to olivine-containing basaltic andesite', ' Young Cone lavas include both andesite and hornblende-containing dacite', ' Volcanic rocks erupted during both stages of San Pedro belong to the potassium-rich calc-alkaline suite', '  San Pedro volcanic rocks are usually glassy with only tiny phenocrysts', ' Plagioclase and pyroxene are the dominant minerals, with amphibole and olivine being secondary components', ' The magma feeding the volcano probably formed from the mixing of magmas of distinct temperatures, as indicated by various clues indicating significant thermal disequilibrium between various components', ' Ultimately they originate in the Altiplano-Puna Magma Body, but undergo storage in shallower crustal magma chambers', ' The eruption of La Poruña appears to have been accompanied by a change in the magma system of the general volcano, a more recent hypothesis regards this cone as a separate volcanic system from San Pedro', '   Climate   The region has an arid climate with infrequent precipitation', ' Moisture ultimately originates on the tropical Atlantic Ocean and much of it rains out as it crosses the Eastern Cordillera and the Altiplano, so that little reaches the western Cordillera, with precipitation in the San Pedro area less than  or about  annually', ' This dryness may go back to the late Jurassic, but was interrupted during the late ice age between 17,000 and 11,000 years before present by a wetter period during which glaciers expanded', ' Temperatures strongly fluctuate between day and night; they can go as low as  and as high as ', '   Eruptive history   San Pedro formed in two stages, which are known as the Old Cone and the Young Cone', ' The Old Cone was formed by lava and scoria and later largely buried by glacial, mudflows and volcanic deposits of the Young Cone; it forms about 80% of the volume of the present-day San Pedro edifice', ' One date has been obtained on Old Cone lavas by argon-argon dating: 160,000 years ago', ' After activity of the Old Cone ceased, glacial and fluvial erosion dissected San Pedro until the large sector collapse occurred', ' The so-called ""white airfall"" with a volume of  as well as pyroclastic flows on the western summit may have been erupted during the collapse but this is uncertain', '  Activity of the Young Cone began after the collapse within the scar left by the failure of the edifice', ' This activity involved the extrusion of four groups of lavas of both andesitic and dacitic composition as well as lava domes and one pumice flow', ' Apparently, the emission of each lava unit was preceded by explosive eruptions which formed pyroclastic flows', ' Argon-argon dating on one of these units has yielded an age of 100,000 ± 35,000 years ago', ' Radiometric and surface-exposure dating has yielded ages of between 110,000-56,000 years ago for La Poruña; it was previously proposed that this cone formed in the late 19th century', ' The La Poruña cone formed in two separate eruptions, each of which yielded a long lava flow; the second eruption remains undated', ' The southwest dome is of comparable age to La Poruña, 107,000 ± 12 years ago', ' In general, dates obtained by argon-argon dating range from 168,000 to 68,000 years ago', ' The entry of mafic magma at depth about 100,000 years ago may have stimulated the occurrence of eruptions not only at San Pedro but also at neighbouring volcanoes', '  A large eruption covered parts of the upper edifice with scoria about 15,000 years before present', ' The Plinian eruption was even more recent, occurring about 10,000 years ago (10,085 ± 45 radiocarbon years ago)', ' After this event four small lava domes formed in the summit region, and partly underwent collapse forming hot avalanche deposits; it is possible that the 1901 eruption was one of these lava dome forming events', '   Historical activity   Eruptions at San Pedro are reported from possibly 1885, when a newspaper from Valparaiso reported ""strong shaking of the earth"", the emission of large quantities of white steam, and damage to the railway, houses and water pipes', ' Other eruptions reported from San Pedro were in 1901 when an eruption caused damage, May–August 1910, 1911, February 1938 and a minor event in December 1960', ' Additional eruptions are mentioned in records and dated to 1870, 1916, 1917, 1923', ' All these eruptions are uncertain and apparently of phreatic nature, and no geological evidence of them has been found', ' The timing of eruptions at San Pedro sometimes is unclear; one eruption reported from 1877 may instead have occurred in 1891 as there are two reports of an eruption before 1910 and they may either refer to one eruption with two candidate dates or two eruptions', ' This volcanic activity makes San Pedro one of the highest active volcanoes', '  Presently, fumaroles in the eastern summit crater are the only ongoing activity at San Pedro; a steam plume is barely visible', ' The fumarole has formed sulfur deposits', ' Based on measurements made in December 2013, the  output of San Pedro is about ', ' Fumaroles were also reported from the Ojos de San Pedro area south of San Pedro volcano, and a report published in 1894 mentions a smell of sulfur at La Poruña', ' In addition, seismic activity has been observed at the volcano', '  The history of volcanic activity at San Pedro indicates two principal hazards from future eruptions', ' The first is the formation of long debris avalanches or pyroclastic flows that could reach the  which is just  away from the volcano', ' The second hazard is formed by a large explosive eruption resulting in ash fall and the emplacement of ignimbrites;
