BO-2008-5#-00005085,1.0,"Miscanti Lake (Spanish: Laguna Miscanti) is a brackish water lake located in the altiplano of the Antofagasta Region in northern Chile. Hydrography and geology   Laguna Miscanti is a maximally  deep lake with clear brackish water which covers a surface area of ; the lake has the shape of an arrowhead with a peninsula jutting from the northern shore. In the past, the two lakes were connected, producing a large waterbody which has left beach terraces in the landscape and whose water levels were about  higher than today. The Cordon de Puntas Negras is the principal source of water. Water reaches Laguna Miscanti principally as groundwater, which is directed there by the fault; this may explain why Laguna Miscanti is a permanent lake rather than a playa. Presently, water seeps to Miñiques through a lava flow along the path of the Quebrada Nacimiento fault; during former lake highstands a combined lake overflowed into the Pampa Varela basin south-southwest of Miñiques. Most water, however, leaves Laguna Miscanti through evaporation. The town of Peine draws its water supply from the Miscanti basin. Biology   Widgeonweed grows at the lakeshores, while the algae charophytes and Chara and the water plant Myriophyllum grow in the lake. During its highstands, algal bioherms and stromatolithes developed in the water."

BO-2008-5#-00005085,1.0,"Miscanti Lake (Spanish: Laguna Miscanti) is a brackish water lake located in the altiplano of the Antofagasta Region in northern Chile. Hydrography and geology   Laguna Miscanti is a maximally  deep lake with clear brackish water which covers a surface area of ; the lake has the shape of an arrowhead with a peninsula jutting from the northern shore. In the past, the two lakes were connected, producing a large waterbody which has left beach terraces in the landscape and whose water levels were about  higher than today. The Cordon de Puntas Negras is the principal source of water. Water reaches Laguna Miscanti principally as groundwater, which is directed there by the fault; this may explain why Laguna Miscanti is a permanent lake rather than a playa. Presently, water seeps to Miñiques through a lava flow along the path of the Quebrada Nacimiento fault; during former lake highstands a combined lake overflowed into the Pampa Varela basin south-southwest of Miñiques. Most water, however, leaves Laguna Miscanti through evaporation. The town of Peine draws its water supply from the Miscanti basin. Biology   Widgeonweed grows at the lakeshores, while the algae charophytes and Chara and the water plant Myriophyllum grow in the lake. During its highstands, algal bioherms and stromatolithes developed in the water."

In the past, the two lakes were connected, producing a large waterbody which has left beach terraces in the landscape and whose water levels were about  higher than today. The Cordon de Puntas Negras is the principal source of water. Water reaches Laguna Miscanti principally as groundwater, which is directed there by the fault; this may explain why Laguna Miscanti is a permanent lake rather than a playa. Presently, water seeps to Miñiques through a lava flow along the path of the Quebrada Nacimiento fault; during former lake highstands a combined lake overflowed into the Pampa Varela basin south-southwest of Miñiques. Most water, however, leaves Laguna Miscanti through evaporation. The town of Peine draws its water supply from the Miscanti basin.

In the past, the two lakes were connected, producing a large waterbody which has left beach terraces in the landscape and whose water levels were about  higher than today. The Cordon de Puntas Negras is the principal source of water. Water reaches Laguna Miscanti principally as groundwater, which is directed there by the fault; this may explain why Laguna Miscanti is a permanent lake rather than a playa. Presently, water seeps to Miñiques through a lava flow along the path of the Quebrada Nacimiento fault; during former lake highstands a combined lake overflowed into the Pampa Varela basin south-southwest of Miñiques. Most water, however, leaves Laguna Miscanti through evaporation. The town of Peine draws its water supply from the Miscanti basin.

In the past, the two lakes were connected, producing a large waterbody which has left beach terraces in the landscape and whose water levels were about  higher than today. The Cordon de Puntas Negras is the principal source of water. Water reaches Laguna Miscanti principally as groundwater, which is directed there by the fault; this may explain why Laguna Miscanti is a permanent lake rather than a playa. Presently, water seeps to Miñiques through a lava flow along the path of the Quebrada Nacimiento fault; during former lake highstands a combined lake overflowed into the Pampa Varela basin south-southwest of Miñiques. Most water, however, leaves Laguna Miscanti through evaporation. The town of Peine draws its water supply from the Miscanti basin.

BO-2008-5#-00005085,1.0,"Miscanti Lake (Spanish: Laguna Miscanti) is a brackish water lake located in the altiplano of the Antofagasta Region in northern Chile. Hydrography and geology   Laguna Miscanti is a maximally  deep lake with clear brackish water which covers a surface area of ; the lake has the shape of an arrowhead with a peninsula jutting from the northern shore. In the past, the two lakes were connected, producing a large waterbody which has left beach terraces in the landscape and whose water levels were about  higher than today. The Cordon de Puntas Negras is the principal source of water. Water reaches Laguna Miscanti principally as groundwater, which is directed there by the fault; this may explain why Laguna Miscanti is a permanent lake rather than a playa. Presently, water seeps to Miñiques through a lava flow along the path of the Quebrada Nacimiento fault; during former lake highstands a combined lake overflowed into the Pampa Varela basin south-southwest of Miñiques. Most water, however, leaves Laguna Miscanti through evaporation. The town of Peine draws its water supply from the Miscanti basin. Biology   Widgeonweed grows at the lakeshores, while the algae charophytes and Chara and the water plant Myriophyllum grow in the lake. During its highstands, algal bioherms and stromatolithes developed in the water."
