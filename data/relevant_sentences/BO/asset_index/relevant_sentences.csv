Geography and geological context  Regional setting  Volcanoes in the Andes occur in four separate regions: the Northern Volcanic Zone between 2°N and 5°S, the Central Volcanic Zone between 16°S and 28°S, the Southern Volcanic Zone between 33°S and 46°S, and the Austral Volcanic Zone, south of the Southern Volcanic Zone', ' These volcanic zones are separated by areas where recent volcanism is absent; one common theory is that the subduction processes responsible for volcanism form a subducting plate that is too shallow to trigger the formation of magma', ' This shallow subduction appears to be triggered by the Nazca Ridge and the Juan Fernandez Ridge; the areas where they subduct beneath the Peru-Chile Trench coincide with the limits of the Central Volcanic Zone', ' It is possible that when these ridges are subducted, the buoyancy they carry disrupts the subduction process and reduces the supply of water, which is important for the formation of melts', '  Of these volcanic zones, the Central Volcanic Zone of which Lascar is a member of is the largest, covering parts of Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile', ' The Central Volcanic Zone is located between two areas where subduction is shallower and volcanic activity is absent', ' In the Central Volcanic Zone, volcanism has been active for 120 million years, although it has undergone eastward migration during this time', ' Water released from the subducting plate triggers the formation of basaltic magmas that are then injected into the crust', '  About 122 volcanoes with Holocene eruptions exist in the Andean

eventually forming the Chaile and Saltar pyroclastic flows', ' The oldest mafic andesites are less than 43,000 years old, while the Chaile and Saltar pyroclastic flows erupted over 26,500 years ago', ' An alternative dating scheme considers Chaile to be 47,000 ± 16,000 years old and Saltar 167,000 ± 9,000 years old', '  Lava flows less than  thick issued from the stage I cone and reached lengths

flow', ' Imprecise argon–argon dating on younger andesites has yielded dates of 14,000 ± 18,000 and 17,000 ± 22,000 years', '  Later volcanic activity buried this edifice beneath thin pyroclastic flows', ' The western edifice generated a complex of lava domes (stage II), which was probably surrounded by a horseshoe-shaped crater open to the west', ' Possibly, the magma chamber of stage I had almost solidified when the injection of basaltic magma at depths of over  triggered a remelting', ' Andesite-rhyodacite intrusions occurred beneath the volcano, some of which were still hot when the Soncor eruption tore them out of the ground', ' An ice cap formed over Lascar at that time, feeding two glaciers that extended northeast and southeast away from the volcano', '  Piedras Grandes unit The stage II activity was accompanied by the eruption of block and ash flows consisting of andesite, and an eruption whose deposits include blocks with sizes of ', ' This unit, formed during stage II, is known as Piedras Grandes,and is exposed on the western slopes below about  altitude', ' The unit is about  wide and consists of large blocks encased in ash', ' The composition of the Piedras Grandes unit is andesite containing amphibole, basaltic andesite and hornblende', ' The Piedras Grandes unit is over 26,500 years old, possibly between 63,000 and 100,000 years old', ' Temperatures have been estimated to be  for the andesite and  for the basaltic andesite', ' The magmas were formed from a remelted proto-pluton that had been heated and resupplied with volatiles by mafic magmas', '  The lava domes interacted with glaciers, resulting in the formation of a glacier run whose deposits are found as far as  from the volcano', ' Blocks with sizes of up to  were transported by this flow', ' An alternative theory posits that the Piedras Grandes unit formed when an ice cap on Lascar interacted with a block and ash flow erupted by Aguas Calientes', '  Soncor eruption A major Plinian eruption occurred 26,450 ± 500 years ago, releasing  of ejecta, both volcanic ash and pyroclastic flows', ' The deposits left contain both andesite and dacite, with phenocrysts consisting of apatite, augite, biotite, iron-titanium oxides, orthopyroxene and plagioclase in a rhyolite matrix', ' The Plinian deposit has a colour ranging from white to creamy', ' Like the Piedras Grandes rocks, they tend towards high potassium quantities, and resemble other volcanic rocks of Lascar and the Central Andes in composition', ' The deposits are formed by a Plinian fallout deposit and an ignimbrite rich in lithics', ' This Plinian deposit reaches thicknesses of  and fell from a  eruption column', '  The Soncor ignimbrite extended as much as  west from the volcano,  north and  south', ' It is white, heterogeneous and mostly featureless with only weak sorting, but features a noticeable compositional zonation', ' The ignimbrite features three facies, one rich in breccia, another rich in pumice, and a normal ignimbrite', '  Ignimbrite was channeled to the Salar de Atacama by the Quebrada de Chaile, Quebrada de Soncor and Quebrada de Talabre canyons and some smaller valleys, northeastwards by the Quebrada de Morro Blanco and as far as  southeastwards over the Pampa Leija area', ' In these valleys, the ignimbrite can be as much as  thick', ' Pumices are encased in the ignimbrite as lenses and levees and are also found in the terrain above the canyons', ' Estimated temperatures decreased from  at the vent to  farther down the flows', ' At the time of emplacement, the ignimbrite was still ', ' Magma temperatures have been estimated at ', ' The Soncor fallout deposit contains a basal gravelly layer and several layers of andesitic and dacitic pumice which also contain lithics', ' The total volume of the Soncor eruption products has been estimated to be either  dense rock equivalent or  net volume, both minimum estimates', ' Lithic rocks derived both from the pre-Soncor volcano and the basement are also represented', '  The magma erupted was generated in a magma chamber starting from andesite, which underwent complex petrogenetic processes', ' This magma chamber was located at a floor depth of  (older estimate ) and probably had a complex shape, given certain chemical properties of the Soncor rocks', ' At the time preceding the eruption, the magma chamber had a thermal stratification; injections of mafic magmas had heated the magma chamber and induced convection', '  A volatile phase containing chlorine formed inside the magma chamber and quickly removed most sulfur from the magma', ' This sulfur extraction was facilitated by the high oxygen content of the magma, which allowed the formation of sulfur dioxide', ' Water is a principal volatile involved in the processes of Plinian eruptions; the water content of the Soncor and Piedras Grandes magmas was about 4–5%', ' The Soncor magmas were associated with a volatile phase that underwent extensive interaction with the future eruption products', '  The previous volcanic edifice was destroyed by this eruption, which may have formed a caldera', ' The vent was no wider than , as it is completely hidden beneath the western cone', ' Such a vent or caldera is substantially smaller than the volume of rocks erupted, a discrepancy that is also evident in the 1932 eruption of Quizapu', ' The Soncor magma chamber may have been too deep to collapse when it was emptied, explaining why no significant caldera was formed', '  The Soncor deposit was subsequently affected by glaciation and the stage I edifice by a debris avalanche, which was radiocarbon dated at 22,310 +2,700/−2000 years ago in the Quebrada de Chaile', ' This debris avalanche is  thick and  long', ' The Capricorn Lava overlies the Soncor deposits', '  Post-Soncor activity Later, a new stratovolcano grew over the Soncor vent', ' This volcano was formed by andesite-dacite lava flows (stage III) and

12,500 years ago, coincident with the Lake Minchin humid period', ' Glaciers in the region reached their maximum size at that time', ' The deposits left by this erosional period contain no clear evidence of stage III activity; indeed Lascar was probably inactive between 14,000 and 10,500 years ago', ' However, an eruption of the Cerro Corona lava dome occurred during this period, and activity of stage III did not commence earlier than 22,300 years ago', '  The Tumbres eruption occurred around 7250 BCE, commencing with the eruption of pumice falls that reach thicknesses of less than ', ' Afterwards, up to four different units of pyroclastic flows, each  thick, formed deposits up to  long', ' At the end of the eruption, a  caldera and the two western craters formed', ' The deposits left by this eruption contain basaltic andesite-andesite and were subject to agglutination and welding', ' Originally considered part of stage III, it was more recently attributed to stage IV given the considerable (6,000 years) temporal gap between the Tumbres eruption and stage III volcanism, and the geochemistry of the rocks', ' The Manquez agglutinate above the Tumbres deposits was formed either by the Tumbres eruption or by a subsequent stage; a pyroclastic cone in the western crater may be associated with this agglutinate', '  Activity subsequently shifted to the eastern edifice', ' Around 5150 ± 1250 BCE, as obtained by surface exposure dating, the Tumbres-Talabre lava flow was erupted from the eastern crater', ' This flow extends  northwest and is  thick', ' The Tumbres-Talabre flow was originally considered to be of late-19th-century age', ' It probably formed when one of the craters filled with andesitic lava to the point of overflow', ' This eruption was the last effusive eruption of Lascar, when later lava domes are excluded', ' The three eastern summit craters formed at the time when the Tumbres-Talabre flow erupted in the remains of the stage I cone', ' This edifice is the currently active one, with the deepest of its three summit craters being active', '  Historical activity Lascar has erupted about thirty times since the 19th century', ' Written reports of volcanic activity exist since the 16th century, when the Spaniards arrived in the region, though few records exist from before 1848', ' Volcanic activity recorded after 1848 consists chiefly of fumarolic emissions and occasional explosive activity', ' Recorded eruptions occurred in 1858, 1875, 1883–1885, 1898–1900(?) and 1902, ranging from a volcanic explosivity index (VEI) of 0 to VEI 2', '

Eruptions in 1972 and 1974 are uncertain', ' For some eruptions, including the January 1854 eruption, it is not clear whether they occurred at Lascar or Aguas Calientes, and some early reports of volcanic activity at Aguas Calientes probably refer to Lascar', '  In 1984, Lascar awakened to new activity; satellite images noted the presence of hot spots on the volcano', ' Landsat images taken during this time indicate that a lava lake may have existed in the central crater, generating a plume of volcanic gases and, in September 1986, a vulcanian eruption happened and dropped ash in Salta, Argentina', ' This eruption was first noticed when ash fell on Salta, and was accompanied by anomalies in the heat emission from the volcano recorded by satellite', ' The eruption was also observed by geologists in Toconao, where the explosion was violent enough to wake up people who were sleeping', ' Observers noted the formation of a cauliflower-shaped cloud that eventually developed into a mushroom cloud with a maximum height of  above the volcano', ' The eruption itself lasted only about five minutes and consisted of two pulses', ' Ash fall in Salta occurred about one hour after the

reaching a size of  width and  height, and was accompanied by explosions', ' It probably started shrinking in April 1992, although the shrinkage was directly visible only in November', ' Small explosions accompanied the shrinkage until, by March 1993, the dome had disappeared again', ""  An alternating cycle of fumarolic activity, an accumulation of fumarolic gases in the conduit and lava dome, and explosive activity followed by renewed fumarolic activity have characterized Lascar's activity since 1984"", ' Explosive activity presumably occurs when gases can no longer escape', ' This occurs because as the magma loses its gas content, the number of pores in it, and thus its permeability to gas, decreases', ' Further, fractures permitting gas passage are obstructed when the magma contracts', ' Most of the time, numerous fumaroles within the crater form a plume that reaches an altitude of ', ' During minor explosive eruptions, eruption columns reach heights of up to ', ' The

continued, to reach another lava dome collapse stage in early 2003', ' While eruptions before 1993 had always been preceded by a reduction in heat radiated from the volcano, such a reduction in 1999–2000 did not lead to an eruption, and when an eruption took place in July 2000, it was preceded by only a brief drop in heat radiation', '  1993 eruption Vulcanian explosions started on 18 April

eruption event known as Piedras Grandes was followed by the large Soncor eruption', ' A new western edifice was constructed on top of the Soncor vent, during the Holocene activity then shifted again to the eastern edifice and continues there to this day', ' The magma supplied to the volcano ultimately comes from the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South America Plate', ' A number of

to be triggered by the Nazca Ridge and the Juan Fernandez Ridge; the areas where they subduct beneath the Peru-Chile Trench coincide with the limits of the Central Volcanic Zone', ' It is possible that when these ridges are subducted, the buoyancy they carry disrupts the subduction process and reduces the supply of water, which is important for the formation of melts', '  Of these volcanic

the considerable (6,000 years) temporal gap between the Tumbres eruption and stage III volcanism, and the geochemistry of the rocks', ' The Manquez agglutinate above the Tumbres deposits was formed either by the Tumbres eruption or by a subsequent stage; a pyroclastic cone in the western crater may be associated with this agglutinate', '  Activity subsequently shifted to the eastern edifice', '

rainy summer period can be used for irrigation by anyone who wants to', ' When the river flow recedes, the stream can only be used for rotational irrigation by those who are entitled to take part in

desirable to start the cropping season in August/September, so that an early harvest can be obtained', ' The early harvest has a high market value and reduces peak labor requirements', ' Further, the irrigation reduces the risk of crop failure and it permits diversification of agricultural produce', ' Nevertheless, there are some farming communities that have refrained in the past from the extra effort to obtain additional irrigation water and who seemed to be content with purely rain-fed cropping', '  At a modest scale, irrigation from deep-wells is also practiced', '  In order to satisfy the needs of the majority of the farmers who strongly wish to have additional irrigation water, the irrigation project Punata-Tiraque began to be developed from 1970 onwards', ' The project entailed the construction of a complicated system of dams and reservoirs up in the Andean mountains (Fig', ' P2)', '  The gross area of the Punata projects is estimated at 4600 ha, 90% of which can be used for agriculture or animal husbandry', ' About 1150 ha of this presently receive irrigation water, either surface water derived from the Laguna Robada or Lluska Kocha dam, or water pumped from the 16 deep wells in the project area (estimated at 350 ha)', ' In addition there are a few hundred hectares that receive occasional water from mita irrigation (wild flooding)', '  The traditional irrigation method is based on handling large irrigation flows (golpes) per farm at large intervals', ' The intake structures in the Pucara Mayu river, at the place where it enters the alluvial fan of Punata, would alternately pass water from each of the reservoir systems (Laguna Robada and Lluska Kocha / Muyu Loma) and the natural mita water', ' The new system has been designed for smaller flows with shorter rotation intervals, but it works continuously for the whole area, so that there is no need anymore to separate the various sources of water', ' It covers a much larger area than the traditional system and it incorporates the associations of the mita systems (which may have partly the same members), the associations of tube-well systems (which may also have partly the same members) as well as the persons who had no previous water rights', '  Hence, the new irrigation system makes it necessary to replace the traditional water rights by a totally new set of rights (and duties)', ' In addition, the farmers will have to get used to new water distribution methods and new field irrigation techniques', ' Because the new irrigation zones do not correspond to the boundaries of the existing, scattered, Comité’s de Riego (Fig', ' P3), not only the water management but also the organizational structure will have to be adjusted to the new situation', ""  See also

it (this is locally called the mita system)', ' By the month of May the river base-flow becomes strongly reduced, and a drought period sets in, lasting into November', '  Irrigation is considered desirable to start the cropping season in August/September, so that an early harvest can be obtained', ' The early harvest has a high market value and reduces peak labor requirements', ' Further, the irrigation reduces the risk of crop failure and it permits diversification of agricultural produce', ' Nevertheless, there are some farming communities that have refrained in the past from the extra effort to obtain additional irrigation water and who seemed to be content with purely rain-fed cropping', '  At a modest scale, irrigation from deep-wells is also practiced', '  In order to satisfy the needs of the majority of the farmers who strongly wish to have additional irrigation water, the irrigation project Punata-Tiraque began to be developed from 1970 onwards', ' The project entailed the construction of a complicated system of dams and reservoirs up in the Andean mountains (Fig', ' P2)', '  The gross area of the Punata projects is estimated at 4600 ha, 90% of which can be used for agriculture or animal husbandry', ' About 1150 ha of this presently receive irrigation water, either surface water derived from the Laguna Robada or Lluska Kocha dam, or water pumped from the 16 deep wells in the project area (estimated at 350 ha)', ' In addition there are a few hundred hectares that receive occasional water from mita irrigation (wild flooding)', '  The traditional irrigation method is based on handling large irrigation flows (golpes) per farm at large intervals', ' The intake structures in the Pucara Mayu river, at the place where it enters the alluvial fan of Punata, would alternately pass water from each of the reservoir systems (Laguna Robada and Lluska Kocha / Muyu Loma) and the natural mita water', ' The new system has been designed for smaller flows with shorter rotation intervals, but it works continuously for the whole area, so that there is no need anymore to separate the various sources of water', ' It covers a much larger area than the traditional system and it incorporates the associations of the mita systems (which may have partly the same members), the associations of tube-well systems (which may also have partly the same members) as well as the persons who had no previous water rights', '  Hence, the new irrigation system makes it necessary to replace the traditional water rights by a totally new set of rights (and duties)', ' In addition, the farmers will have to get used to new water distribution methods and new field irrigation techniques', ' Because the new irrigation zones do not correspond to the boundaries of the existing, scattered, Comité’s de Riego (Fig', ' P3), not only the water management but also the organizational structure will have to be adjusted to the new situation', ""  See also

eruption event known as Piedras Grandes was followed by the large Soncor eruption', ' A new western edifice was constructed on top of the Soncor vent, during the Holocene activity then shifted again to the eastern edifice and continues there to this day', ' The magma supplied to the volcano ultimately comes from the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South America Plate', ' A number of

to be triggered by the Nazca Ridge and the Juan Fernandez Ridge; the areas where they subduct beneath the Peru-Chile Trench coincide with the limits of the Central Volcanic Zone', ' It is possible that when these ridges are subducted, the buoyancy they carry disrupts the subduction process and reduces the supply of water, which is important for the formation of melts', '  Of these volcanic

frequent andesite lava and pyroclastic flow activity, and a dacitic one that was involved in the Piedras Grandes and Soncor activities', '  Temperatures of the magma chamber range from ; the mafic magmas that are injected in the chamber are about  hotter than the extant andesite and dacite', ' The chamber may be surrounded by skarnic alteration', ' This alteration gives rise to wollastonite and pyroxene-containing skarn, depending on the distance from the magma chamber walls', ' Metasomatism does further affect rocks derived from magma chamber walls', ' The conditions at the magma chamber may be comparable to these under which epithermal mineral deposits form', ' The oxidation conditions in the magma chamber are favourable for the formation of sulfate, but unfavourable for the deposition of sulfide minerals', ""  A number of xenoliths occur in Lascar's rocks; a large amount of the phenocrysts are ultimately derived from them"", "" Hornfels, skarn, and rocks that are part of

magma chamber was located at a floor depth of  (older estimate ) and probably had a complex shape, given certain chemical properties of the Soncor rocks', ' At the time preceding the eruption, the magma chamber had a thermal stratification; injections of mafic magmas had heated the magma chamber and induced convection', '  A volatile phase containing chlorine formed inside the magma chamber and quickly removed most sulfur from the magma', ' This sulfur extraction was facilitated by the high oxygen content of the magma, which allowed the formation of sulfur dioxide', ' Water is a principal

Afterwards, up to four different units of pyroclastic flows, each  thick, formed deposits up to  long', ' At the end of the eruption, a  caldera and the two western craters formed', ' The deposits left by this eruption contain basaltic andesite-andesite and were subject to agglutination and welding', ' Originally considered part of stage III, it was more recently attributed to stage IV given the considerable (6,000 years) temporal gap between the Tumbres eruption and stage III volcanism, and the geochemistry of the rocks', ' The Manquez agglutinate above the Tumbres deposits was formed either by the Tumbres eruption or by a subsequent stage; a pyroclastic cone in the western crater may be associated with this agglutinate', '  Activity subsequently shifted to the eastern edifice', ' Around 5150 ± 1250 BCE, as obtained by surface exposure dating, the Tumbres-Talabre lava flow was erupted from the eastern crater', ' This flow extends  northwest and is  thick', ' The Tumbres-Talabre

explosions accompanied the shrinkage until, by March 1993, the dome had disappeared again', ""  An alternating cycle of fumarolic activity, an accumulation of fumarolic gases in the conduit and lava dome, and explosive activity followed by renewed fumarolic activity have characterized Lascar's activity since 1984"", ' Explosive activity presumably occurs when gases can no longer escape', ' This
