whether or not the dam achieves that goal in reality"", ' Lumas Kendrick, of the Inter-American Development Bank states that, of the energy that is generated by the dam, over half is lost due to poor power lines, defective transformers, and billing issues', ' Of the energy that is generated and distributed, it is limited in its ability to reach all of Haiti, as only 12 per cent of the country has electrical wires', ' These areas with electricity are concentrated around urban centers, thereby reducing the overall impact of the hydroelectric power on  rural development in the country', '  Recent developments  Silting Silting has greatly reduced the operational capacity of the dam for the generation of electricity', ' The upper Artibonite watershed is faced with issues of severe erosion, caused by deforestation and agriculture', ' The erosion is estimated at 1,305 metric tons per km2 per year in the watershed, on average', ' The problems of heavy deforestation and soil erosion in rainy seasons have caused a large amount of sediment to become trapped in the dam, reducing its functionality', ' Additionally, the silt in the Péligre reservoir has decreased the reservoir storage

destroyed their old way of life, benefiting the distant city of Port-au-Prince instead', '  Academic critiques For some, the instance of the Péligre Dam exemplifies an international development system that treats poor humans as means, not ends, with rich countries and corporate leaders considered to be more important than the poor people themselves', ' This perspective reflects neoliberal and

building the dam neglected the livelihoods of the poor that are impacted by the dam', ' From the initial planning stages of the dam in which locals were neither informed nor consulted to the forced

purpose of providing energy throughout Haiti, many contend that the energy provided by the dam is not distributed equitably', "" Furthermore, the dam has had significant environmental, social, and health consequences on the local people, who were forced to relocate as a result of the dam's completion"", ' These are points of concern to academics, journalists, and human rights activists who, noting heavy North American involvement in the planning and construction of the dam, believe that neoliberal influences may be at play', '  Background  Geography The Péligre dam is in the Artibonite watershed, the largest hydrographic basin in Haiti', '  Composition and dimensions The power plant contains three 17 MW Francis turbine-generators for an installed capacity of 51 MW', '  Initial building and purpose The Péligre Dam was proposed as a means to rehabilitate the agricultural lands of the Central Plateau through control of floods as well as to generate hydroelectricity to fuel the industrial expansion of Haiti', 'Jennifer Wells, ""A dam for the people, and A people damned"", ‘’Toronto Star’’, November 21, 2010 The Artibonite would become the first source of hydroelectric power

popularized throughout the country as a mechanism for increased crop yields via controlled irrigation', ' Rice grown for export, in particular, was the target of this irrigation intervention', ' Also, it was believed that the generation of a reliable supply of electricity from the dam would drive economic growth and reduce social disparity', '  Planning and construction of the dam was heavily influenced by the United States of America', ' The dam was nicknamed the “Little TVA” after the Tennessee Valley Authority, because of its purpose of providing energy for all of Haiti', ' The dam was designed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers', ' It was funded by the Export Import Bank of the United States', ' Construction on the dam was overseen by engineer André A', ' Loiselle', ' The dam was completed in 1956 by the US Army Corps of Engineers and Brown & Root, creating Lake Péligre (essentially a large reservoir) in the process', '  Power generation and distribution The Péligre

whether or not the dam achieves that goal in reality"", ' Lumas Kendrick, of the Inter-American Development Bank states that, of the energy that is generated by the dam, over half is lost due to poor power lines, defective transformers, and billing issues', ' Of the energy that is generated and distributed, it is limited in its ability to reach all of Haiti, as only 12 per cent of the country has electrical wires', ' These areas with electricity are concentrated around urban centers, thereby reducing the overall impact of the hydroelectric power on  rural development in the country', '  Recent developments  Silting Silting has greatly reduced the operational capacity of the dam for the generation of electricity', ' The upper Artibonite watershed is faced with issues of severe erosion, caused by deforestation and agriculture', ' The erosion is estimated at 1,305 metric tons per km2 per year in the watershed, on average', ' The problems of heavy deforestation and soil erosion in rainy seasons have caused a large amount of sediment to become trapped in the dam, reducing its functionality', ' Additionally, the silt in the Péligre reservoir has decreased the reservoir storage capacity from 600 million cubic metres to 300 MCM in 60 years', "" Reforestation and erosion control methods discussed before the dam's creation have not been carried out"", ""  As a result of the

to the usual environmental impact of reservoirs, the flooding caused by the dam has prompted the relocation of farming families, and there have been extremely high levels of deforestation and erosion

destroyed their old way of life, benefiting the distant city of Port-au-Prince instead', '  Academic critiques For some, the instance of the Péligre Dam exemplifies an international development system that treats poor humans as means, not ends, with rich countries and corporate leaders considered to be more important than the poor people themselves', ' This perspective reflects neoliberal and
