the German-style indirect rule at the end of 1917', ' Musinga was restored to his throne at Nyanza, with Kigali remaining home to the colonial administration', ' This arrangement persisted until the

Kingdom of Rwanda from the 17th century and then by the German Empire, the city was founded in 1907 when Richard Kandt, the colonial resident, chose the site for his headquarters, citing its central location, views and security', ' Foreign merchants began to trade in the city during the German era, and Kandt opened some government-run schools for Tutsi Rwandan students', ' Belgium took control of Rwanda and Burundi during World War I, forming the mandate of Ruanda-Urundi', "" Kigali remained the seat of colonial administration for Rwanda but Ruanda-Urundi's capital was at Usumbura (now Bujumbura) in Burundi and Kigali remained a small city with a population of just 6,000 at the time of independence"", '  Kigali grew slowly during the following decades', ' It was not initially directly affected by the Rwandan Civil War between government forces and the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which began in 1990', "" However, in April 1994 Rwanda's President Juvénal Habyarimana was killed when his aircraft was shot down near Kigali"", ' His death was followed by the Rwandan genocide, with Hutu extremists loyal to the interim government killing an estimated 500,000–800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu nationwide', ' The RPF resumed fighting, ending a cease-fire of more than a year', ' They gradually took control of most of the country and seized Kigali on 4 July 1994', ' Post-genocide Kigali has experienced rapid population growth, with much of the city rebuilt', '  The city of Kigali is one of the five provinces of Rwanda, with boundaries set in 2006', ' It is divided into three districts—Gasabo, Kicukiro, and Nyarugenge—which historically had control of significant areas of local governance', "" Reforms in January 2020 transferred much of the districts'

product is the service sector, but a significant proportion of the population works in agriculture including small-scale subsistence farming"", ' Attracting international visitors is a priority for city authorities, including leisure tourism, conferences and exhibitions', '  Etymology The name Kigali comes from the Kinyarwanda prefix ki- combined with the adjective suffix -gali, which means wide or broad', ' This was originally applied to Mount Kigali, most likely because the mountain itself was broad and wide, with the city later being named after the mountain', ' According to Rwandan oral history, the name originated in the 14th century', "" Rwandan scholar Alexis Kagame, who did extensive research into the country's oral history and traditions, wrote that the name Kigali came into use after King Cyilima I Rugwe completed a conquest of the area"", ' The legend states that Rugwe viewed the territory from the top of a hill and said burya iki gihugu ni kigali, which translates to ""this country is vast""', '  History  Pre-colonial period  The earliest inhabitants of what is now Rwanda were the Twa, a group of aboriginal pygmy hunter-gatherers who settled the area between 8000 and 3000\xa0BC and remain in the country today', ' They were followed between 700\xa0BC and AD\xa01500 by a number of Bantu groups, including the Hutu and Tutsi, who began clearing forests for agriculture', ' According to oral history, the Kingdom of Rwanda was founded in the 14th century on the shores of Lake Muhazi, around  east of modern Kigali', ' The early kingdom included Kigali but it was a small state at this point in its history with larger and more powerful neighbours, Bugesera and Gisaka', "" A member of the Gisaka dynasty killed Rwanda's king Ruganzu I Bwimba in the 16th

administrator and explorer Richard Kandt was appointed as the first resident of Rwanda, and established the city as the headquarters"", ' Alexis Kagame promoted an alternative theory that the city was established as a capital under Cyilima I Rugwe in either the 1300s or the 1500s', ' There is little direct evidence for this, however, and the more recent kings of the pre-colonial era are known to have been based at Nyanza', ' Rwanda and neighbouring Burundi had been assigned to Germany by the Berlin Conference of 1884, forming part of German East Africa, and Germany established a presence in the country in 1897 with the formation of an alliance with the king, Yuhi V Musinga', ' Kandt arrived in 1899, to explore Lake Kivu and search for the source of the Nile', '  When Germany decided in 1907 to separate the administration of Rwanda from that of Burundi, Kandt was appointed as resident', ' He chose to make his headquarters in Kigali due to its central location in the country, and also

attempted to assert direct rule on the mandate, placing King Musinga under arrest and sidelining Rwandans in the judiciary', ' In this period, Kigali was one of two provincial capitals, alongside Gisenyi', ' An agricultural-labour shortage caused by the recruitment of locals to assist the European armies during the war, the plundering of food by soldiers, and torrential rains which destroyed crops, led to a severe famine at the start of the Belgian administration', ' The famine, combined with the difficulty of governing the complex Rwandan society, prompted the Belgians to re-establish the German-style indirect rule at the end of 1917', ' Musinga was restored to his throne at Nyanza, with Kigali remaining home to the colonial administration', ' This arrangement persisted until the mid-1920s, but from 1924 the Belgians began once more to sideline the monarchy, this time permanently', ' Belgium took over control of dispute resolution, appointment of officials and collection of

peacekeeping force was established in the city, and the RPF were granted use of a building in the city for their diplomats and soldiers', ' In April 1994 President Habyarimana was assassinated when his plane was shot down near Kigali International Airport', ' Burundian president Cyprien Ntaryamira was also killed in the attack', ' This was the catalyst for the Rwandan genocide, in which 500,000–800,000 Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu were killed in well-planned attacks on the orders of the interim government', ' 500,000–800,000 is the range of scholarly estimates listed on the third page of the paper', "" Opposition politicians based in Kigali were killed on the first day of the genocide, and the city then became the setting for fierce fighting between the army and the RPF including at the latter's base"", ' The RPF began attacking from the north of the country, and gradually took control of most of Rwanda between April and June', ' After encircling Kigali and cutting off its supply routes, they began fighting for the city itself in mid-June', ' The government forces had superior manpower and weapons but the RPF fought tactically, and were able to exploit the fact that the government forces were concentrating on the genocide rather than the fight for Kigali', ' The RPF took control of Kigali on 4 July, a date now commemorated as Liberation Day, a Rwandan national holiday', '  Since the war and genocide the city has experienced rapid population growth as a result of migration from other areas, as well as a high birth rate', ' Buildings that were heavily damaged during the fighting have been demolished, much of the city has been rebuilt, and modern office buildings and infrastructure now exist across the city', ' A masterplan, adopted by the city and the government in 2013 and supported by international finance and labour, seeks to establish Kigali as a decentralised modern city by 2040', "" The development has been accompanied by forced
