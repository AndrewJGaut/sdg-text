off its supply routes, they began fighting for the city itself in mid-June', ' The government forces had superior manpower and weapons but the RPF fought tactically, and were able to exploit the fact that the government forces were concentrating on the genocide rather than the fight for Kigali', ' The RPF took control of Kigali on 4 July, a date now commemorated as Liberation Day, a Rwandan

established as a capital under Cyilima I Rugwe in either the 1300s or the 1500s', ' There is little direct evidence for this, however, and the more recent kings of the pre-colonial era are known to have been based at Nyanza', ' Rwanda and neighbouring Burundi had been assigned to Germany by the Berlin Conference of 1884, forming part of German East Africa, and Germany established a presence in the country in 1897 with the formation of an alliance with the king, Yuhi V Musinga', ' Kandt arrived in 1899, to explore Lake Kivu and search for the source of the Nile', '  When Germany decided in 1907 to separate the administration of Rwanda from that of Burundi, Kandt was appointed as resident', ' He chose to make his headquarters in Kigali due to its central location in the country, and also

off its supply routes, they began fighting for the city itself in mid-June', ' The government forces had superior manpower and weapons but the RPF fought tactically, and were able to exploit the fact that the government forces were concentrating on the genocide rather than the fight for Kigali', ' The RPF took control of Kigali on 4 July, a date now commemorated as Liberation Day, a Rwandan national holiday', '  Since the war and genocide the city has experienced rapid population growth as a result of migration from other areas, as well as a high birth rate', ' Buildings that were

development plans"", ' Like other provinces, Kigali is divided into districts—Gasabo, Kicukiro, and Nyarugenge—which are in turn divided into 35 sectors', '  From January 2020 a new administrative system for Kigali was introduced, after a law was passed by the national parliament the previous year', ' Under the previous system, in effect since 2002, power was significantly devolved to the districts which were led by their own mayors, managing infrastructure and levying taxes, around 30 per cent of which were passed to the city-wide authority', ' The changes, implemented with the goal of reducing bureaucracy and inefficiency, gave the city council much greater power including control of the budget', ' The districts ceased to be separate legal entities, their mayors being replaced by district executive administrators appointed by the national government', '  The city council is composed of eleven individuals, down from 33 in the old system', ' Six of the council members are directly elected by the public, each district electing one man and one woman', ' The remaining five members are appointed by the president of Rwanda, subject to the approval of the cabinet', ' Each

are often ""unable to respond to an emergency call in a timely manner"", and that police patrols are more focused on terrorism than crime', '  Despite this, Kigali has a reputation for being a relatively safe city', ' The Lonely Planet guidebook describes it as ""a genuine contender for the safest capital in Africa"", while Bert Archer of BBC Travel described it as ""clean and safe""', ' In

Rutikanga noted that there were crimes related to burglary, drugs, assault and robbery, as well as petty crime and pickpocketing, but that numbers were kept low through community policing and engagement with schools, businesses, municipal government and social service providers', ' In its advice to overseas visitors, OSAC states that there is a ""moderate risk from crime in Kigali"", but notes that such crime is rarely violent', ' It cites pickpocketing and petty theft as the biggest concerns for foreigners within the city', ' Rwanda as a whole has lower crime rates than other

have been based at Nyanza', ' Rwanda and neighbouring Burundi had been assigned to Germany by the Berlin Conference of 1884, forming part of German East Africa, and Germany established a presence in

agriculture', ' According to oral history, the Kingdom of Rwanda was founded in the 14th century on the shores of Lake Muhazi, around  east of modern Kigali', ' The early kingdom included Kigali but it was a small state at this point in its history with larger and more powerful neighbours, Bugesera and Gisaka', "" A member of the Gisaka dynasty killed Rwanda's king Ruganzu I Bwimba in the 16th

administrator and explorer Richard Kandt was appointed as the first resident of Rwanda, and established the city as the headquarters"", ' Alexis Kagame promoted an alternative theory that the city was established as a capital under Cyilima I Rugwe in either the 1300s or the 1500s', ' There is little direct evidence for this, however, and the more recent kings of the pre-colonial era are known to have been based at Nyanza', ' Rwanda and neighbouring Burundi had been assigned to Germany by the Berlin Conference of 1884, forming part of German East Africa, and Germany established a presence in the country in 1897 with the formation of an alliance with the king, Yuhi V Musinga', ' Kandt arrived in 1899, to explore Lake Kivu and search for the source of the Nile', '  When Germany decided in 1907 to separate the administration of Rwanda from that of Burundi, Kandt was appointed as resident', ' He chose to make his headquarters in Kigali due to its central location in the country, and also

off its supply routes, they began fighting for the city itself in mid-June', ' The government forces had superior manpower and weapons but the RPF fought tactically, and were able to exploit the fact that the government forces were concentrating on the genocide rather than the fight for Kigali', ' The RPF took control of Kigali on 4 July, a date now commemorated as Liberation Day, a Rwandan national holiday', '  Since the war and genocide the city has experienced rapid population growth as a result of migration from other areas, as well as a high birth rate', ' Buildings that were
