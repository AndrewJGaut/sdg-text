well as substandard infrastructure and a lack of skilled workers', ' In 2011, the parliament passed a law establishing special economic zones in Rwanda, the first of which was established in 2014 on Masoro Hill in Gasabo district, close to Kigali International Airport', ' Companies operating within the zone benefit from good infrastructure, availability of land and transport links, as well as tax

development plans"", ' Like other provinces, Kigali is divided into districts—Gasabo, Kicukiro, and Nyarugenge—which are in turn divided into 35 sectors', '  From January 2020 a new administrative system for Kigali was introduced, after a law was passed by the national parliament the previous year', ' Under the previous system, in effect since 2002, power was significantly devolved to the districts which were led by their own mayors, managing infrastructure and levying taxes, around 30 per cent of which were passed to the city-wide authority', ' The changes, implemented with the goal of reducing bureaucracy and inefficiency, gave the city council much greater power including control of the budget', ' The districts ceased to be separate legal entities, their mayors being replaced by district executive administrators appointed by the national government', '  The city council is composed of eleven individuals, down from 33 in the old system', ' Six of the council members are directly elected by the public, each district electing one man and one woman', ' The remaining five members are appointed by the president of Rwanda, subject to the approval of the cabinet', ' Each council member serves for a renewable five-year term', ' The executive branch of the city government is headed by the mayor, who is elected via a complex electoral college system, with the electorate

Commissioner of Police Felly Rutagerura Bahizi"", "" The United States government's Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) praises the RNP's professionalism, but notes that it lacks specialist skills in dealing with policing tasks such as investigation, counter-terrorism, bomb disposal, and forensics"", ' OSAC also notes that the RNP has limited resources on the ground, stating that police are often ""unable to respond to an emergency call in a timely manner"", and that police patrols are more focused on terrorism than crime', '  Despite this, Kigali has a reputation for being a relatively safe city', ' The Lonely Planet guidebook describes it as ""a genuine contender for the safest capital in Africa"", while Bert Archer of BBC Travel described it as ""clean and safe""', ' In a 2015 interview with The New Times, then-commander of the central division Rogers Rutikanga cited ""efficient operations and daily surveillance"" as the means by which the city was policed', ' Rutikanga noted that there were crimes related to burglary, drugs, assault and robbery, as well as petty crime and pickpocketing, but that numbers were kept low through community policing and engagement with schools, businesses, municipal government and social service providers', ' In its advice to overseas visitors, OSAC states that there is a ""moderate risk from crime in Kigali"", but notes that such crime is rarely violent', ' It cites pickpocketing and petty theft as the biggest concerns for foreigners within the city', ' Rwanda as a whole has lower crime rates than other countries in East Africa', ' In 2014–15, the number of intentional homicides per 100,000 people was 2', '52 in the country, compared with 11', '52 for Uganda, 6', '95 for Tanzania, 4', '79 for Kenya,

the Rwanda Film Centre, founded by journalist Eric Kabera', "" One of the centre's goals was to diversify the subjects covered by Rwandan films beyond the genocide theme, presenting other aspects of the country"", ' In 2005, Kabera inaugurated the Rwanda Film Festival which takes place annually at venues in the capital and elsewhere, giving it the nickname ""Hillywood"", a portmanteau word combining Rwanda\'s nickname ""land of a thousand hills"" with Hollywood', "" The term is also used for Rwanda's film industry in general"", '  On Genocide Memorial Day, a national holiday observed

Kingdom of Rwanda from the 17th century and then by the German Empire, the city was founded in 1907 when Richard Kandt, the colonial resident, chose the site for his headquarters, citing its central location, views and security', ' Foreign merchants began to trade in the city during the German era, and Kandt opened some government-run schools for Tutsi Rwandan students', ' Belgium took control of Rwanda and Burundi during World War I, forming the mandate of Ruanda-Urundi', "" Kigali remained the seat of colonial administration for Rwanda but Ruanda-Urundi's capital was at Usumbura (now

directly affected by the Rwandan Civil War between government forces and the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which began in 1990', "" However, in April 1994 Rwanda's President Juvénal Habyarimana was killed when his aircraft was shot down near Kigali"", ' His death was followed by the Rwandan genocide, with Hutu extremists loyal to the interim government killing an estimated 500,000–800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu nationwide', ' The RPF resumed fighting, ending a cease-fire of more than a year', ' They gradually took control of most of the country and seized Kigali on 4 July 1994', ' Post-genocide Kigali has experienced rapid population growth, with much of the city rebuilt', '  The city of Kigali is one of the five provinces of Rwanda, with boundaries set in 2006', ' It is divided into three districts—Gasabo, Kicukiro, and Nyarugenge—which historically had control of significant areas of local governance', "" Reforms in January 2020 transferred much of the districts'

product is the service sector, but a significant proportion of the population works in agriculture including small-scale subsistence farming"", ' Attracting international visitors is a priority for city authorities, including leisure tourism, conferences and exhibitions', '  Etymology The name Kigali comes from the Kinyarwanda prefix ki- combined with the adjective suffix -gali, which means wide or broad', ' This was originally applied to Mount Kigali, most likely because the mountain itself was broad and wide, with the city later being named after the mountain', ' According to Rwandan oral history, the name originated in the 14th century', "" Rwandan scholar Alexis Kagame, who did extensive research into the country's oral history and traditions, wrote that the name Kigali came into use after King Cyilima I Rugwe completed a conquest of the area"", ' The legend states that Rugwe viewed the territory from the top of a hill and said burya iki gihugu ni kigali, which translates to ""this country is vast""', '  History  Pre-colonial period  The earliest inhabitants of what is now Rwanda were the Twa, a group of aboriginal pygmy hunter-gatherers who settled the area between 8000 and 3000\xa0BC and remain in the country today', ' They were followed between 700\xa0BC and AD\xa01500 by a number of Bantu groups, including the Hutu and Tutsi, who began clearing forests for agriculture', ' According to oral history, the Kingdom of Rwanda was founded in the 14th century on the shores of Lake Muhazi, around  east of modern Kigali', ' The early kingdom included Kigali but it was a small state at this point in its history with larger and more powerful neighbours, Bugesera and Gisaka', "" A member of the Gisaka dynasty killed Rwanda's king Ruganzu I Bwimba in the 16th

administrator and explorer Richard Kandt was appointed as the first resident of Rwanda, and established the city as the headquarters"", ' Alexis Kagame promoted an alternative theory that the city was established as a capital under Cyilima I Rugwe in either the 1300s or the 1500s', ' There is little direct evidence for this, however, and the more recent kings of the pre-colonial era are known to have been based at Nyanza', ' Rwanda and neighbouring Burundi had been assigned to Germany by the Berlin Conference of 1884, forming part of German East Africa, and Germany established a presence in the country in 1897 with the formation of an alliance with the king, Yuhi V Musinga', ' Kandt arrived in 1899, to explore Lake Kivu and search for the source of the Nile', '  When Germany decided in 1907 to separate the administration of Rwanda from that of Burundi, Kandt was appointed as resident', ' He chose to make his headquarters in Kigali due to its central location in the country, and also

attempted to assert direct rule on the mandate, placing King Musinga under arrest and sidelining Rwandans in the judiciary', ' In this period, Kigali was one of two provincial capitals, alongside Gisenyi', ' An agricultural-labour shortage caused by the recruitment of locals to assist the European armies during the war, the plundering of food by soldiers, and torrential rains which destroyed crops, led to a severe famine at the start of the Belgian administration', ' The famine, combined with the difficulty of governing the complex Rwandan society, prompted the Belgians to re-establish the German-style indirect rule at the end of 1917', ' Musinga was restored to his throne at Nyanza, with Kigali remaining home to the colonial administration', ' This arrangement persisted until the mid-1920s, but from 1924 the Belgians began once more to sideline the monarchy, this time permanently', ' Belgium took over control of dispute resolution, appointment of officials and collection of

disruption following the coup was short-lived and the army had left the streets by 11 July', '  Kigali was not directly affected during the first three years of the 1990–1994 Rwandan Civil War,

peacekeeping force was established in the city, and the RPF were granted use of a building in the city for their diplomats and soldiers', ' In April 1994 President Habyarimana was assassinated when his plane was shot down near Kigali International Airport', ' Burundian president Cyprien Ntaryamira was also killed in the attack', ' This was the catalyst for the Rwandan genocide, in which 500,000–800,000 Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu were killed in well-planned attacks on the orders of the interim government', ' 500,000–800,000 is the range of scholarly estimates listed on the third page of the paper', "" Opposition politicians based in Kigali were killed on the first day of the genocide, and the city then became the setting for fierce fighting between the army and the RPF including at the latter's base"", ' The RPF began attacking from the north of the country, and gradually took control of most of Rwanda between April and June', ' After encircling Kigali and cutting off its supply routes, they began fighting for the city itself in mid-June', ' The government forces had superior manpower and weapons but the RPF fought tactically, and were able to exploit the fact that the government forces were concentrating on the genocide rather than the fight for Kigali', ' The RPF took control of Kigali on 4 July, a date now commemorated as Liberation Day, a Rwandan national holiday', '  Since the war and genocide the city has experienced rapid population growth as a result of migration from other areas, as well as a high birth rate', ' Buildings that were heavily damaged during the fighting have been demolished, much of the city has been rebuilt, and modern office buildings and infrastructure now exist across the city', ' A masterplan, adopted by the city and the government in 2013 and supported by international finance and labour, seeks to establish Kigali as a decentralised modern city by 2040', "" The development has been accompanied by forced
