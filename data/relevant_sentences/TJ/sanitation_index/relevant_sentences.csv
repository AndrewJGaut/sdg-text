predating oil painting in Europe by as much as six centuries', ' However, the press release picked up by media, clearly misdates the earliest uses of oil paint in Europe, which is fully described in a

attributable to contamination from fingers, as the touching of the painting is encouraged in Buddhist tradition, was dispelled by spectroscopy and chromatography giving an unambiguous signal for the intentional use of drying oils rather than contaminants', ' Oils were discovered underneath layers of paint, unlike surface contaminants', '  Scientists also found the translation of the beginning

standing to the side of the charriot, wearing a Corinthian helmet with a feather, and holding a shield', ' In the top portion are wind gods, flying with a scarf held in both hands', ' This great composition is unique, and has no equivalent in Gandhara or India, but there are some similarities with the painting of Kizil or Dunhuang', '  The central image of the Sun God on his golden chariot is framed by two lateral rows in individuals: Kings and dignitaries mingling with Buddhas and Bodhisattvas', ' One of the personages, standing behind a monk in profile, much be the King of Bamiyan', ' He wears a crenalated crown with single crescent and korymbos, a round-neck tunic and a Sasanian headband', '  Hephthalite donors Several of the figures have the characteristic appearance of the Hephthalites of Tokharistan, with belted jackets with a unique lapel of their tunic being folded on the right side, the cropped hair, the hair accessories, their distinctive physionomy and their round beardless faces', ' These figures must represent the donors  and potentates who supported the building of the monumental giant Buddha', ' The individuals in this painting are very similar to the individuals depicted in Balalyk Tepe, and they may be related to the Hepthalites', '""Seizing large areas, the Hephthalites met with various kinds of art and of course, to some extent, acted as intermediary in the transfer of artistic traditions of one nation to another', ' It is here, in the opinion of Albaum, that the similarity of some of the figures in paintings from Balalyk-tepe and those from Bamiyan must be sought, which then was part of the Hephthalite state', ' Such similarities are exemplified by the right side triangular lapel, hair accessories and some ornamental motifs',

They discovered that the paint contained pigments such as vermilion (red mercury sulfide) and lead white (lead carbonate)', ' These were mixed with a range of binders, including natural resins, gums (possibly animal skin glue or egg), and oils, probably derived from walnuts or poppies', ' Specifically, researchers identified drying oils from murals showing Buddhas in vermilion robes sitting cross-legged amid palm leaves and mythical creatures as being painted in the middle of the 7th century', ' It is believed that they are the oldest known surviving examples of oil painting, possibly predating oil painting in Europe by as much as six centuries', ' However, the press release picked up by media, clearly misdates the earliest uses of oil paint in Europe, which is fully described in a treatise by Theophilus Presbyter of 1100-1120, and may date back to the Ancient Romans', ' See: Rutherford John Gettens, George Leslie Stout, 1966, Courier Dover Publications,  Painting Materials: A Short Encyclopedia (online text), p', ' 42  The discovery may lead to a reassessment of works in ancient ruins in Iran, China, Pakistan, Turkey, and India', '  Initial suspicion that the oils might be attributable to contamination from fingers, as the touching of the painting is encouraged in Buddhist tradition, was dispelled by spectroscopy and chromatography giving an unambiguous signal for the intentional use of drying oils rather than contaminants', ' Oils were discovered underneath layers of paint, unlike surface contaminants', '  Scientists also found the translation of the beginning
