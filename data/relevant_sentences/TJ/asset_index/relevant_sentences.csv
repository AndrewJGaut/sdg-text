percent increase in cotton cultivation mandated by Soviet and post-Soviet agricultural planners between 1964 and 1994 consequently overtaxed the regional water supply', ' Poorly designed irrigation

(possibly animal skin glue or egg), and oils, probably derived from walnuts or poppies', ' Specifically, researchers identified drying oils from murals showing Buddhas in vermilion robes sitting cross-legged amid palm leaves and mythical creatures as being painted in the middle of the 7th century', ' It is believed that they are the oldest known surviving examples of oil painting, possibly predating oil painting in Europe by as much as six centuries', ' However, the press release picked up by media, clearly misdates the earliest uses of oil paint in Europe, which is fully described in a treatise by Theophilus Presbyter of 1100-1120, and may date back to the Ancient Romans', ' See: Rutherford John Gettens, George Leslie Stout, 1966, Courier Dover Publications,  Painting Materials: A Short Encyclopedia (online text), p', ' 42  The discovery may lead to a reassessment of works in ancient ruins in Iran, China, Pakistan, Turkey, and India', '  Initial suspicion that the oils might be attributable to contamination from fingers, as the touching of the painting is encouraged in Buddhist tradition, was dispelled by spectroscopy and chromatography giving an unambiguous signal for the intentional use of drying oils rather than contaminants', ' Oils were discovered underneath layers of paint, unlike surface contaminants', '  Scientists also found the translation of the beginning
