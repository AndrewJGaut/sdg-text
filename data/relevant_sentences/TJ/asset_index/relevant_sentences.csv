TJ-2017-7#-00000209,", Environmental Performance Reviews, 104-109) Hydroelectricity powers the aluminum production at the Tajik Aluminum Company in Tursunzoda, a major source of Tajikistan's industrial output and export revenue. Not only did Vladimir Leninâ€™s ideology identify the decentralization of industry as a way to counter the colonial exploitation of indigenous peoples, but the USSR had strategic aims as well, especially in World War II when industry was evacuated eastward away from the German front. After Tajik independence Soviet Central Asia had a centrally planned economy in which the different republics supplied resources to each other at different times of the year. Tajikistan is therefore pursuing a course of action to increase hydroelectric capacity by building more dams on the Vakhsh, in order to promote economic growth and move towards energy independence. The Rogun Dam began construction in Soviet times but remains uncompleted; now Tajikistan has recommenced the project with financial support from the Russian Aluminum Company. , Environmental Performance Reviews, 165 The 2008 financial crisis has further increased poverty, which in turn has further decreased pollution. Such an event could potentially have serious economic consequences by disrupting power generation, stopping production at the Tajik Aluminum Company, and cutting off supplies of drinking and irrigation water for downstream users.

TJ-2017-7#-00000209,", Environmental Performance Reviews, 104-109) Hydroelectricity powers the aluminum production at the Tajik Aluminum Company in Tursunzoda, a major source of Tajikistan's industrial output and export revenue. Not only did Vladimir Leninâ€™s ideology identify the decentralization of industry as a way to counter the colonial exploitation of indigenous peoples, but the USSR had strategic aims as well, especially in World War II when industry was evacuated eastward away from the German front. After Tajik independence Soviet Central Asia had a centrally planned economy in which the different republics supplied resources to each other at different times of the year. Tajikistan is therefore pursuing a course of action to increase hydroelectric capacity by building more dams on the Vakhsh, in order to promote economic growth and move towards energy independence. The Rogun Dam began construction in Soviet times but remains uncompleted; now Tajikistan has recommenced the project with financial support from the Russian Aluminum Company. , Environmental Performance Reviews, 165 The 2008 financial crisis has further increased poverty, which in turn has further decreased pollution.
