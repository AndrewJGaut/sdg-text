They discovered that the paint contained pigments such as vermilion (red mercury sulfide) and lead white (lead carbonate)', ' These were mixed with a range of binders, including natural resins, gums (possibly animal skin glue or egg), and oils, probably derived from walnuts or poppies', ' Specifically, researchers identified drying oils from murals showing Buddhas in vermilion robes sitting cross-legged amid palm leaves and mythical creatures as being painted in the middle of the 7th century', ' It is believed that they are the oldest known surviving examples of oil painting, possibly predating oil painting in Europe by as much as six centuries', ' However, the press release picked up by media, clearly misdates the earliest uses of oil paint in Europe, which is fully described in a treatise by Theophilus Presbyter of 1100-1120, and may date back to the Ancient Romans', ' See: Rutherford John Gettens, George Leslie Stout, 1966, Courier Dover Publications,  Painting Materials: A Short Encyclopedia (online text), p', ' 42  The discovery may lead to a reassessment of works in ancient ruins in Iran, China, Pakistan, Turkey, and India', '  Initial suspicion that the oils might be attributable to contamination from fingers, as the touching of the painting is encouraged in Buddhist tradition, was dispelled by spectroscopy and chromatography giving an unambiguous signal for the intentional use of drying oils rather than contaminants', ' Oils were discovered underneath layers of paint, unlike surface contaminants', '  Scientists also found the translation of the beginning

Ulugh Beg’s father, you can see Ulugh Beg’s visit to the Maragha Observatory had an effect on Ulugh Beg', ' This could have affected Ulugh Beg’s reason for his transformation of the city of Samarkand and his mathematical orientation', ' Other matters such as, political, economic, military, social, and even commercial reasons could have played a role in the building of Ulugh Beg’s observatory', ' Another reason of starting his own observatory could have been because of Ulugh Beg’s differences in observations of those with al-Sūfī', '  The Ulugh Beg Observatory was built somewhere around 824–1422', ' Different sources mention different dates; however, many sources mention around 830 to be the date of the observatory’s foundation and 1422–1428 to be the period during which the construction of the observatory was completed', ' Many Old Persian texts include the Samarkand Observatory and the great Ulugh Beg', '  He invited skillful mathematicians and astronomers to help build this observatory and also a madrassa in Samarkand', ' Among those he invited were Ghīyāth al-Dīn Jamshid al-Kashi, Mu’in al-Din al-Kashi, Salah al-Din Qadi Zada Rumi, and Ali Qushiji', ' Over 60 mathematicians and astronomers were invited to the observatory', ' Jamshīd al-Kāshī was appointed as the first director of the observatory', ' After al-Kashi’s death Qada Zada became the director of the observatory', ' After the death of Qadi Zada, Qushji led the observatory as the last and final director', ' The Samarkand Observatory was a place for astronomers and mathematician to work together in finding new discoveries', '  Ulugh Beg’s observatory was built according to the plans of the Maragha observatory, which was designed by Nasir al-din al-Tusi', ' Ulugh Beg’s observatory included the largest quadrant principle device', ' The building was not tall but was allowed a maximal size for the arc of the circle', ' This device was carefully oriented, and the arc was scaled very accurately', ' This device was very versatile', ' It could accurately measure the sun from the horizon, the altitude of a star and other planets', ' The duration of the year, period of planets, and eclipses were measured by this device', ' Ulugh Beg’s measurements of planets closely relate to today’s measurement, showing us the phenomenal accuracy of the device', ""  People visiting Ulugh Beg's observatory today, can only see the foundations and the buried part of the marble quadrant"", ' Those are the only original vestiges from the observatory', "" Much of the decline of the observatory could be attributed to Ulugh Beg's assassination by his son, Abd al Latif, in around 1449"", "" Ulugh Beg's death caused chaos within the observatory"", ' The observatory was destroyed and dozens of talented astronomers and mathematicians were driven away', ' In 1908, the Russian archaeologist Vassily Vyatkin uncovered the remains of the observatory', '  Scientific atmosphere  Jamshid Al-Kashi, a 15th century astronomer and mathematician, is known to have relocated to Samarkand to interact with the scientific processes taking place there', ' Having received an invitation from Ulugh Beg,

place at the observatory', ' However, a new letter written by Al-Kashi to his father has been found in Iran, and the translation of this letter by Bagheri sheds more light on the scientific atmosphere of Samarkand in particular and reduces the ambiguity of certain elements in the first letter by virtue of their overlapping parts', '  In the letter, Al-Kashi describes a problem about astrology that he discussed with his colleagues', ' The translation, ‘‘[Let us suppose that] the Sun is, e', 'g', ', in 10 degrees of Aquarius, with a certain altitude, and the ascendent of time is a certain degree

Ulugh Beg” where astrology has an extremely limited discussion', ' Astrology, only mentioned once in passing in Krisciunas’s paper on the scientific atmosphere of Ulugh Beg, was perhaps a more integrated element of the scientific discourse in the Samarkand world given the new, aforementioned letter', '  Per the letter of Al-Kashi to his father, an innovation was created with Ulugh Beg', ' The Fakhrı sextant, stood on top of a rock into which some of it was carved, so the edifice would not be tall given the soft bricks of the area', ' Al-Kashi compares this to Maragha, saying that the sextant is positioned higher there but also notes the flat roof present in Samarkand should facilitate scientific improvement given the fact that “instruments may be placed on it”', ' This information, about the sextants in Maragha is contradictory to other sources that state there were no sextants at Maragha', ' This contradiction was revealed by the translation', '  Moreover, the scientific atmosphere of Samarkand was one of general isolation because Al-Kashi describes the stout adherence to Ptolemy’s methodologies and lack of awareness for happenings of the Maragha observatory', ' The lack of awareness and strict adherence to prior methods by Ulugh Beg himself reveals the perhaps provincial nature of their studies', ' However, this perceived closed-mindedness was alleviated by the increasing diversity of scientists and students that were invited to the observatory', ' An evaluation of the errors made in Ptolemy at Samarkand by Shevchenko further confirms the effects of Samarkand’s initial isolated nature', '  According to Bageri’s translation of Al-Kashi’s letter, a lot of teaching was going on there strictly from memory by teachers who had learned from astronomers in Herat', ' Moreover, at the time Al-Kashi wrote the letter, three of the teachers were well versed in Islamic jurisprudence: Qazızada, Maulana Muhammad Khanı, and Maulana Abu’l-Fath', ' The letter also states that Ulugh Beg did not show up to teach class often', '  Maulana Abu’l-Fath stated that he was intellectually underneath Maulana Muhammad Khanı, who was only occasionally present in the court meetings or observatory meetings, and Qazızada, who was always practicing his craft', ' ""To do them justice, [I must admit that] (30) when there is a discussion in

engines, both wings, the left main landing gear assembly, many aft galley components, the horizontal stabilizer, human remains and personal effects, and much miscellaneous debris', ' Some material, such as an escape slide and some right engine components, were located outside the landmine-free area', ' These items were documented with binoculars and digital camera zoom features', '  The investigative team faced very challenging weather conditions, difficult terrain, and potential landmine hazards', ' The evidence recovered from the site was insufficient to determine a definite cause for the crash, but the location suggested that the crew had descended below the minimum descent altitude for the phase of the approach that they were in', ' Without the cockpit voice recorder, survivors, witnesses, or a valid flight data recording, the investigation stalled', ' In 2006, the Civil Aviation Operation of the Ministry of Transport of Afghanistan released their final report

attack, human rights lawyer Jonathan Horowitz noted of that ""Under certain specific and narrowly tailored conditions, individuals can be attacked even when their actions fall short of carrying

such as an escape slide and some right engine components, were located outside the landmine-free area', ' These items were documented with binoculars and digital camera zoom features', '  The investigative team faced very challenging weather conditions, difficult terrain, and potential landmine hazards', ' The evidence recovered from the site was insufficient to determine a definite cause for the crash, but the location suggested that the crew had descended below the minimum descent altitude for the phase of the approach that they were in', ' Without the cockpit voice recorder,
