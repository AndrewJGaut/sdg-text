The colonial state needed to be able to levy taxes in money on the Congolese, so it was important that they could make money by selling their produce or their labour within the framework of the colonial economy.

Modeled on King Leopold's Congo Free State, concessions were doled out to private companies that endeavored to strip the region's assets as quickly and cheaply as possible before depositing a percentage of their profits into the French treasury. The concessionary companies forced local people to harvest rubber, coffee, and other commodities without pay and held their families hostage until they met their quotas. Between 1890, a year after the French first arrived, and 1940, the population declined by half due to diseases, famine and exploitation by private companies. In 1996–1997, reflecting steadily decreasing public confidence in the government's erratic behaviour, three mutinies against Patassé's administration were accompanied by widespread destruction of property and heightened ethnic tension. Prefectures and sub-prefectures   The Central African Republic is divided into 16 administrative prefectures (préfectures), two of which are economic prefectures (préfectures economiques), and one an autonomous commune; the prefectures are further divided into 71 sub-prefectures (sous-préfectures). The economic prefectures are Nana-Grébizi and Sangha-Mbaéré, while the commune is the capital city of Bangui. It also alleged harsh and life-threatening conditions in prisons and detention centers, arbitrary arrest, prolonged pretrial detention and denial of a fair trial, restrictions on freedom of movement, official corruption, and restrictions on workers' rights.

Food crops are not exported in large quantities, but still constitute the principal cash crops of the country, because Central Africans derive far more income from the periodic sale of surplus food crops than from exported cash crops such as cotton or coffee.

CD-2013-6#-00000258,1.0,"Katanga's mineral wealth played an important part in the secession. As 33.7% of the revenue of the Congo came from the sale of the copper mined in Katanga, ownership of the company was an important consideration for the leaders the Congolese Independence movement while the Belgian government was most reluctant to give up its share in the UMHK, and did not finally do so until 1967. Brussels had neither inspired nor engineered Moise Tshombe's scheme of Katangese secession, but provided technical, financial, and military aid in order to keep Katanga stable in terms of public order and domestic security. At the same time, Pierre Wigny, the Foreign Minister, informed the United States, France, and Britain that his government was opposed to Tshombe's intrigues and was concerned that long-term separation would compromise Congo's economic vitality. Like other nationalists in the Third World who had experienced European imperialism and racism, African nationalists tended to be somewhat anti-Western in the 1950s-1960s, making the cause of African nationalism very suspect to rightists in the West, and as such Katanga which was dominated by the Belgians was seen as an example of the right sort of an African state.Brownell, Josiah ""Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition"", The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 210 & 215 The conservative American intellectual James Burnham wrote in a column praising Katanga that what African nationalists want was ""to destroy the power and privileges of the white men; to take over their property, or most of it; and to permit white men to remain only as servants and handmaids"". Tshombe was held under house arrest and charged with inciting revolt against the Congolese government, the illegal seizure of arms and aircraft, and printing counterfeit money by issuing Katangese currency. Thant, who had become increasingly incensed by what he regarded as the Katangese state stalling for time, imposed economic sanctions. The new administration of John F. Kennedy had decided that the Adoula government represented the best hope of stability in the Congo, all more so as Adoula professed to be a firm anti-Communist.Brownell, Josiah ""Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition"", The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 216 As Katanga happened to possess most of the Congo's mineral wealth, it was realized that Adoula government could not economically function if Katanga were allowed to secede, causing Kennedy to come down on the side of Congolese unity. The United Nations provided assistance in reuniting divided economic and administrative divisions. The Grand Council had veto powers on key issues including constitutional matters, legal practice, taxation and the functioning and running of the vital mining industry. His collaborators include Mwepu (head of the administrative section); Philippart (head of the consulate);  (head of the cultural section); Mertens (protocol section); Henrard (economic section) Dominique Diur Resident Minister in Paris CONAKAT Collaborators at the Paris office include Colonel Bernard Delègue (political adviser); Captain Jean-Louis Bovagnet (military adviser); and Jacques Sidos (consular adviser for cultural and press relations) Odilon Mwenda Secretary of State at the European Economic Community in Brussels CONAKAT Assisted Jacques Masangu at the representation in Brussels, and replaced him as the head of the office at the beginning of 1962."

The concessionary companies forced local people to harvest rubber, coffee, and other commodities without pay and held their families hostage until they met their quotas. Between 1890, a year after the French first arrived, and 1940, the population declined by half due to diseases, famine and exploitation by private companies. In 1996–1997, reflecting steadily decreasing public confidence in the government's erratic behaviour, three mutinies against Patassé's administration were accompanied by widespread destruction of property and heightened ethnic tension. Prefectures and sub-prefectures   The Central African Republic is divided into 16 administrative prefectures (préfectures), two of which are economic prefectures (préfectures economiques), and one an autonomous commune; the prefectures are further divided into 71 sub-prefectures (sous-préfectures). The economic prefectures are Nana-Grébizi and Sangha-Mbaéré, while the commune is the capital city of Bangui. It also alleged harsh and life-threatening conditions in prisons and detention centers, arbitrary arrest, prolonged pretrial detention and denial of a fair trial, restrictions on freedom of movement, official corruption, and restrictions on workers' rights. Economy  upright=1.3|thumb|right|A proportional representation of Central African Republic exports, 2019 [[File:Bangui Shopping District.jpg|thumb|Bangui shopping district]]  The per capita income of the Republic is often listed as being approximately $400 a year, one of the lowest in the world, but this figure is based mostly on reported sales of exports and largely ignores the unregistered sale of foods, locally produced alcoholic beverages, diamonds, ivory, bushmeat, and traditional medicine. Food crops are not exported in large quantities, but still constitute the principal cash crops of the country, because Central Africans derive far more income from the periodic sale of surplus food crops than from exported cash crops such as cotton or coffee. Since at least 2002 there have been plans to connect Bangui by rail to the Transcameroon Railway.Eur, p. 185   Energy   The Central African Republic primarily uses hydroelectricity as there are few other resources for energy and power."
CD-2013-6#-00000258,1.0,"Katanga's mineral wealth played an important part in the secession. As 33.7% of the revenue of the Congo came from the sale of the copper mined in Katanga, ownership of the company was an important consideration for the leaders the Congolese Independence movement while the Belgian government was most reluctant to give up its share in the UMHK, and did not finally do so until 1967. Brussels had neither inspired nor engineered Moise Tshombe's scheme of Katangese secession, but provided technical, financial, and military aid in order to keep Katanga stable in terms of public order and domestic security. At the same time, Pierre Wigny, the Foreign Minister, informed the United States, France, and Britain that his government was opposed to Tshombe's intrigues and was concerned that long-term separation would compromise Congo's economic vitality. Like other nationalists in the Third World who had experienced European imperialism and racism, African nationalists tended to be somewhat anti-Western in the 1950s-1960s, making the cause of African nationalism very suspect to rightists in the West, and as such Katanga which was dominated by the Belgians was seen as an example of the right sort of an African state.Brownell, Josiah ""Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition"", The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 210 & 215 The conservative American intellectual James Burnham wrote in a column praising Katanga that what African nationalists want was ""to destroy the power and privileges of the white men; to take over their property, or most of it; and to permit white men to remain only as servants and handmaids"". Tshombe was held under house arrest and charged with inciting revolt against the Congolese government, the illegal seizure of arms and aircraft, and printing counterfeit money by issuing Katangese currency. Thant, who had become increasingly incensed by what he regarded as the Katangese state stalling for time, imposed economic sanctions. The new administration of John F. Kennedy had decided that the Adoula government represented the best hope of stability in the Congo, all more so as Adoula professed to be a firm anti-Communist.Brownell, Josiah ""Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition"", The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 216 As Katanga happened to possess most of the Congo's mineral wealth, it was realized that Adoula government could not economically function if Katanga were allowed to secede, causing Kennedy to come down on the side of Congolese unity. The United Nations provided assistance in reuniting divided economic and administrative divisions. The Grand Council had veto powers on key issues including constitutional matters, legal practice, taxation and the functioning and running of the vital mining industry. His collaborators include Mwepu (head of the administrative section); Philippart (head of the consulate);  (head of the cultural section); Mertens (protocol section); Henrard (economic section) Dominique Diur Resident Minister in Paris CONAKAT Collaborators at the Paris office include Colonel Bernard Delègue (political adviser); Captain Jean-Louis Bovagnet (military adviser); and Jacques Sidos (consular adviser for cultural and press relations) Odilon Mwenda Secretary of State at the European Economic Community in Brussels CONAKAT Assisted Jacques Masangu at the representation in Brussels, and replaced him as the head of the office at the beginning of 1962."

This being the height of the Cold War, the U.S. and Belgium did not want to lose control of the strategic wealth of the Congo, in particular its uranium. Kinshasa suffered greatly from Mobutu's excesses, mass corruption, nepotism and the civil war that led to his downfall. The city has recently had to fend off rioting soldiers, who were protesting the government's failure to pay them. Geography [[File:Fleuve Congo Kinshasa 8.JPG|thumb|Down at the banks of the Congo River in Ngaliema commune]]  Kinshasa is a city of sharp contrasts, with affluent residential and commercial areas and three universities alongside sprawling slums. It describes many of the new neighborhoods as slums, built in unsafe conditions with inadequate infrastructure. According to UN-Habitat, 390,000 people immigrate to Kinshasa annually, fleeing warfare and seeking economic opportunity. The Belgian development agency (Coopération technique belge; CTB) since 2006 sponsors the Programme d’Appui aux Initiatives de Développement Communautaire (Paideco), a 6-million-euro program aimed at economic development. A pop culture ideal type in Kinshasa is the mikiliste, a fashionable person with money who has traveled to Europe. Urban renewal projects have led in some cases to violent conflict and displacement.Aurélie Fontaine, ""Housing: Kinshasa is for the rich”; Africa Report 5 May 2015. According to Congolese sources , an agreement with a Chinese construction company was signed in 2006, according to which this Chinese company will finance the renovation of the track, the rolling stock, the communication channels the signaling and the electrical energy, the ex -ONATRA has, in fact, opted for an aggressive commercial policy to revive the rail.

CD-2013-6#-00000258,1.0,"Katanga's mineral wealth played an important part in the secession. As 33.7% of the revenue of the Congo came from the sale of the copper mined in Katanga, ownership of the company was an important consideration for the leaders the Congolese Independence movement while the Belgian government was most reluctant to give up its share in the UMHK, and did not finally do so until 1967. Brussels had neither inspired nor engineered Moise Tshombe's scheme of Katangese secession, but provided technical, financial, and military aid in order to keep Katanga stable in terms of public order and domestic security. At the same time, Pierre Wigny, the Foreign Minister, informed the United States, France, and Britain that his government was opposed to Tshombe's intrigues and was concerned that long-term separation would compromise Congo's economic vitality. Like other nationalists in the Third World who had experienced European imperialism and racism, African nationalists tended to be somewhat anti-Western in the 1950s-1960s, making the cause of African nationalism very suspect to rightists in the West, and as such Katanga which was dominated by the Belgians was seen as an example of the right sort of an African state.Brownell, Josiah ""Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition"", The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 210 & 215 The conservative American intellectual James Burnham wrote in a column praising Katanga that what African nationalists want was ""to destroy the power and privileges of the white men; to take over their property, or most of it; and to permit white men to remain only as servants and handmaids"". Tshombe was held under house arrest and charged with inciting revolt against the Congolese government, the illegal seizure of arms and aircraft, and printing counterfeit money by issuing Katangese currency. Thant, who had become increasingly incensed by what he regarded as the Katangese state stalling for time, imposed economic sanctions. The new administration of John F. Kennedy had decided that the Adoula government represented the best hope of stability in the Congo, all more so as Adoula professed to be a firm anti-Communist.Brownell, Josiah ""Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition"", The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 216 As Katanga happened to possess most of the Congo's mineral wealth, it was realized that Adoula government could not economically function if Katanga were allowed to secede, causing Kennedy to come down on the side of Congolese unity. The United Nations provided assistance in reuniting divided economic and administrative divisions. The Grand Council had veto powers on key issues including constitutional matters, legal practice, taxation and the functioning and running of the vital mining industry.
