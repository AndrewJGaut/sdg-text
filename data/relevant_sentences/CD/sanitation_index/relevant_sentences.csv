During the low water period of June, July and August the guaranteed power output is no more than 30 MW. A 2004 report recommended creation of a water retention structure to guarantee full power output throughout the year. A 2005 OECD report noted that during the civil war the hydroelectric plants had been badly damaged, and there were severe shortages of water and electricity.
