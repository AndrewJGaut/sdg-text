destroyed by Ansar Dine jihadists on 2 July 2012, following the Battle of Gao and Timbuktu', ' These elements were later reconstructed under the direction of UNESCO team', '  History The construction of the mosque of Sidi Yahya, sometimes written Sidi Yahia, began in 1400 by Sheikh El-Mokhtar Hamalla', ' The Sidi Yahya mosque is one of\xa0 the oldest mosques in Timbuktu and holds special significance: when the Touareg under their leader Akil took control of Timbuktu in 1433, they gave the chieftaincy to Mohammed Naddi, a Senhaja from Chinguetti who commissioned the mosque', ' It took 40 years to complete', ' In 1441 Mohamed Naddah, the city-governor of Timbuktu, appointed his close friend Sidi Yahya al-Tadelsi, who was later venerated as a saint, as its first imam', "" \xa0Sidi

Sidi Yahya Mosque’s architecture diverges slightly from traditional Islamic architecture’s focus on cosmology', ' Instead of emphasis on divinity and heaven typically expressed through ornament and epigraphy, Sidi Yahya Mosque utilizes clay, mud, and rock to reiterate earthiness and connections to living and dead ancestors whose physical bodies remain buried within the mosque', ' Permanence and monumentality were the primary objectives in medieval African socio-political structures, and this permanence is thought to be reflected through the earth-based architectural styles used to construct the Sidi Yahya Mosque', ' The significance of earthworks and earth style architecture reflects the rules of ancestral significance in medieval Africa', ' Individuals who built the mosque along with other monuments were also grave-diggers and tomb-makers, further incorporating the sacred nature of the Earth and its ancestors into its style', '  Sidi Yahya closely resembles other famous mosques in Timbuktu, such as the Sankore and the Djinguereber mosques', ' However, key differences distinguish the Sidi Yahya mosque', ' The doors of the Sidi Yahya mosque are low and ornately designed, showing Moroccan influence from the time when the city was under Maghsharan Tuareg authority (c', ' 1400-1468)', ' Architecturally, the building contains a covered prayer hall, internal courtyards, wooden doors, and arched openings', ' A single minaret with pointed arches rises above the mosque and main courtyard but does not reach the height of the two other large mosques in the city', ' The courtyard was later converted into a cemetery that is no longer in use', ' The imams of the mosque are buried in an underground area north of the building where evening and morning prayers are recited', ' It also contains lodgings for the mosque’s guard', ' A smaller, external courtyard is used as reading space during the celebration of the birth of Prophet Muhammad', ' The roof of the mosque, like other buildings in Timbuktu, is supported by wood from the indigenous ronnier tree, covered with layers of mud to form the plaster-like exterior', ' Compared to other mosques of Timbuktu, this one benefits from greater care and maintenance', '  Desecration  In the summer of 2012, members of Ansar Dine, a group tied to al-Qaeda, broke down the doors of the mosque, which according to legend were not to be opened until the end of time', "" The Jihadist's justification for the destruction of the city’s shrines and mausoleums was that they contradicted the strict interpretation of Islam"", ' Along with the mosque, the tombs embedded within its exterior surface were also desecrated', ' They claimed that the reverence for the site was idolatrous, as it was said that daily visits to the tomb of Imam Sidi Yahya would provide blessings to believers', ' The group later offered roughly $100 US dollars to repair the mosque, which was turned down by imam Alpha Abdoulahi', ' The following year, a suicide bomber from Ansar Dine destroyed windows and a door of the mosque and compromised the stability of its minaret', ' In 2016, the International Criminal Court found Ahmad al-Faqi al-Mahdi, a

opened until the end of time', "" The Jihadist's justification for the destruction of the city’s shrines and mausoleums was that they contradicted the strict interpretation of Islam"", ' Along with the mosque, the tombs embedded within its exterior surface were also desecrated', ' They claimed that the reverence for the site was idolatrous, as it was said that daily visits to the tomb of Imam Sidi Yahya would provide blessings to believers', ' The group later offered roughly $100 US dollars to repair the mosque, which was turned down by imam Alpha Abdoulahi', ' The following year, a suicide bomber from Ansar Dine destroyed windows and a door of the mosque and compromised the stability of its minaret', ' In 2016, the International Criminal Court found Ahmad al-Faqi al-Mahdi, a
