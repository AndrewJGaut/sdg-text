centre, Stone Town, is a World Heritage Site', ""  Zanzibar's main industries are spices, raffia, and tourism"", ' In particular, the islands produce cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, and black pepper', ' For this reason, the Zanzibar Archipelago, together with Tanzania\'s Mafia Island, are sometimes referred to locally as the ""Spice Islands""', ' Tourism in Zanzibar is a more recent activity, driven by government promotion that caused an increase from 19,000 tourists in 1985, to 376,000 in 2016', ' The islands are accessible via 5 ports and the Abeid Amani Karume International Airport, which can serve up to 1', '5 million passengers per year', ""  Zanzibar's marine ecosystem is an important part of the economy for fishing and algaculture and contains important marine ecosystems that act as fish nurseries for Indian Ocean fish populations"", ' Moreover, the land ecosystem is the home of the endemic Zanzibar red colobus, the Zanzibar servaline genet, and the extinct or rare Zanzibar leopard', ' Pressure from the tourist industry and fishing as well as larger threats such as sea level rise caused by climate change are creating increasing environmental concerns throughout the region', '   Etymology  The word Zanzibar came from Arabic zanjibār ( ), which is in turn from Persian zangbâr ( ), a compound of Zang ( , ""black"") + bâr ( , ""coast""), cf', ' the Sea of Zanj', ' The name is one of several toponyms sharing similar etymologies, ultimately meaning ""land of the blacks"" or similar meanings, in reference to the dark skin of the inhabitants', '   History    Pre-1498  The presence of microliths suggests that Zanzibar has been home to humans for at least 20,000 years, which was the beginning of the Later Stone Age', '  A Greco-Roman text between the 1st and 3rd centuries, the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, mentioned the island of Menuthias (), which is probably Unguja', ' Zanzibar, like the nearby coast, was settled by Bantu speakers at the outset of the first millennium', ' Archaeological finds at Fukuchani, on the northwest coast of Zanzibar, indicate a settled agricultural and fishing community from the 6th century at the latest', ' The considerable amount of daub found indicates timber buildings, and shell beads, bead grinders, and iron slag have been found at the site', ' There is evidence of limited engagement in long-distance trade: a small amount of imported pottery has been found, less than 1% of total pottery finds, mostly from the Gulf and dated to the 5th to 8th century', ' The similarity to contemporary sites such as Mkokotoni and Dar es Salaam indicates a unified group of communities that developed into the first center of coastal maritime culture', ' The coastal towns appear to have been engaged in Indian Ocean and inland African trade at this early period', ' Trade rapidly increased in importance and quantity beginning in the mid-8th century and by the close of the 10th century Zanzibar was one of the

originally built with timber (circa 1050) and later in mud with coral walls (circa 1150)', ' The houses were continually rebuilt with more permanent materials', ' By the 13th century, houses were built with stone, and bonded with mud, and the 14th century saw the use of lime to bond stone', ' Only the wealthier patricians would have had stone and lime built houses, the strength of the materials allowing for flat roofs, while the majority of the population lived in single-story thatched houses similar to those from the 11th and 12th centuries', ' According to John Middleton and Mark Horton, the architectural style of these stone houses have no Arab or Persian elements, and should be viewed as an entirely indigenous development of local vernacular architecture', "" While much of Zanzibar Town's architecture was rebuilt during Omani rule, nearby sites elucidate the general development of Swahili, and Zanzibari, architecture before the 15th century"", '  From the 9th century, Swahili merchants on Zanzibar operated as brokers for long-distance traders from both the hinterland and Indian Ocean world', ' Persian, Indian, and Arab traders frequented Zanzibar to acquire East African goods like gold, ivory, and ambergris and then shipped them overseas to Asia', ' Similarly, caravan traders from the African Great Lakes and Zambezian Region came to the coast to trade for imported goods, especially Indian cloth', ' Before the Portuguese arrival, the southern towns of Unguja Ukuu and Kizimkazi and the northern town of Tumbatu were the dominant centers of exchange', ' Zanzibar was just one of the many autonomous city-states that dotted the East African littoral', ' These towns grew in wealth as the Swahili people served as intermediaries and facilitators to merchants and traders', ' This interaction between Central African and Indian Ocean cultures contributed in part to the evolution of the Swahili culture, which developed an Arabic-script literary tradition', ' Although a Bantu language, the Swahili language as a consequence today includes some borrowed elements, particularly loanwords from Arabic, though this was mostly a 19th-century phenomenon with the growth of Omani hegemony', ' Many foreign traders from Africa and Asia married into wealthy patrician families on Zanzibar', ' Particularly Asian men, who ""wintered"" on the coast

hydropower studies and the engineers' ability to accurately implement complex designs"", ' There would also be a project management issue in undertaking infrastructure on this scale with recruitment estimated at 4000 plus personnel and a number of sub-contractors', ' Neither company appears to have experience of management on this scale', ' In its most extreme sense, this raises questions about dam safety, both in the construction phases and in the end product', ' A number of dam collapses such as the St', ' Francis Dam (USA)  or Malpasset Dam (France)  stemmed from poor studies and insufficient engineering standards', '  Another risk concerns environmental and social impacts', ' Given inexperience, the companies are unlikely to be familiar with mitigation codes of practice that could limit impacts, e', 'g', ' stopping dumping of soil in the river or in handling waste', ' There are also concerns over dam safety for workers, given the long history of accidents on dam projects before extra industry efforts in the 21st century', '  There are also significant concerns over poaching which has been a longstanding issue in the Selous Game Reserve', ' Poaching was the primary reason for placing the UNESCO World Heritage Selous Game Reserve on a list of endangered sites', ' The increased presence of people and steady flow of construction traffic, as well as logging camps, provides substantive opportunities for poaching and smuggling, especially if the companies do not have knowhow to enforce anti-poaching measures', "" Thus, the choice of the contractors magnify the pre-existing risks of undertaking the Stiegler's Gorge project"", ""  Risks to operation   There are a number of risks to the effective functioning of the Stiegler's Gorge Hydropower Project, if it is completed"", ' One of these comes from climate change', "" It is unclear if the total rainfall in Tanzania will increase or decrease, but studies suggest that precipitation's variability will increase"", "" This is important as it will affect hydropower production, decreasing the dam's electricity-generation reliability"", ' This is particularly important in the context of hydro-dependency', ' Tanzania gets the majority of its electricity from hydropower', "" A failure in these dams in the dry season is the key reason for the country's power failures, which happen frequently"", "" This vulnerability will increase if the Stiegler's Gorge Dam is completed"", "" If brought online today, a failure of the Stiegler's Gorge Hydropower Plant would reduce power production by 58"", '3%', '  The other risk comes from sedimentation', ' A report highlighted the vulnerability of the reservoir to rapid sedimentation', ' This is because of the existing sediment load in the Rufiji River and the high levels of erosion likely to occur around the reservoir', "" Higher sedimentation would decrease the reservoir's capacity to store water"", ' Such a reduction would reduce the reliability of the reservoir, as it would make it more directly dependent on precipitation', ""  Another fiscal danger comes from the ability of Tanzania's electricity utility, TANESCO, to sell the hydro-plant's energy"", "" Given Tanzania's current peak capacity of around 1"", '05GW and installed capacity of 1', ""5GW, there are persistent doubts about whether Tanzania can sell the dam's energy"", "" A number of reports cast doubt on the ability of the Tanzanian economy and electrification schemes to absorb the dam's demand"", ' Without such sales, the government will not easily recoup their investment', ' These reports also suggest that selling to the regional grid, to neighbouring countries through the Southern and Eastern African Power Pools, is unlikely to work given that both trading schemes are insufficiently institutionalised', ' There also appears to be a high level of distrust between countries when it comes to relying on others for power', ""  Negative Impacts  Academics and consultants have established the Stiegler's Gorge Dam's impacts"", "" They have argued that the significant level of environmental and social effects constitute an important trade-off in pursuing Stiegler's Gorge Dam"", ""  Environmental impacts  The key controversy of the proposed Stiegler's Gorge project concerns its environmental impacts"", ' An obvious concern is the location of the gorge in the middle of the Selous Game Reserve World Heritage Site', ' Firstly, the dam will flood over 2', ""2% of the reserve's total area, roughly equivalent to the size of Andorra, reducing its forest and riverine habitat"", '  Additionally, the dam project would be directly above the main area of biodiversity in the reserve', ' This consists of a large wetland, marsh and savanna area', ' The Rufiji River plays a central role in creating this environment', ' In the wet season, this river has a particularly strong hydrological surge', "" This force of water during the wet season changes the Rufiji River's path, creating a shifting pattern of oxbow lakes, dried river channels and wetland"", ' Collectively this creates a rich habitat contrasting with surrounding dry savannah', '  The Rufiji River has a strong seasonal variation', ' In the wet season, it floods a large area of land, irrigating the soil and spreading nutrient sediments', ' The wet season also refills and connects lakes in the Selous Reserve', '  Building a dam will change this seasonal river pattern and withhold sediment', ' It will create a more constant hydrological discharge, reducing the wet season flood', ' This will undermine the ecological irrigating and fertilising services of the river', "" The Stiegler's Gorge Dam will therefore harm the wetland areas of the Selous and the wide variety of mammal and bird life that use it, including numerous waders, storks and herons as well as hippo and crocodiles"", ' Large, land-based mammals from elephants to lions also benefit from the presence of the water, particularly in the dry season', '  The Selous contains a number of endangered species, including white and black rhinoceros, lion, cheetah, Sanje crested Mangaby, wetland crane, lesser kestrel, Udzungwa red colobus monkey, Udzungwa forest partridge and rufous-winged partridge', ' Impact assessments indicate these could be affected by a future project', '  The dam will mean that downstream oxbow lakes are cut-off, become more saline from evaporation and will reduce in size', ' Cutting-off the lakes will also prevent the regeneration of fish stocks, particularly migratory fish', ' A study by Duvail et al', ' found that these negative impacts would occur even with a mitigating flood release of 2,500cms', ' For instance, this proposed water release would end at least two of the downstream lakes', '  Below the Selous Game Reserve is the Rufiji River Delta', ' This delta area, including Mafia Island, is protected by the highest international level of wetland protection, called the Ramsar Convention', "" The ecology of this area also depends on the river's seasonal nature"", "" The wet season's river-water surge counteracts the saline sea, maintaining a balance of salinity in the delta that underpins its current plant and animal mix"", ' This salinity balance supports the largest mangrove stand in East Africa', ""  The river's wet season surge, because it brings a large volume of fertile sediments, also supports an algal bloom in the ocean delta"", ' This bloom spawns a rapid annual explosion in plankton, which in-turn supports a rapid increase in fish', ' Migratory whale sharks and other animals also visit the delta area in the wet season to specifically take advantage of this bloom', ""  By altering the river's flow and withholding sediment, the dam will therefore damage the UNESCO Selous Site, downstream lakes and the Ramsar-protected delta area"", '  Social Impacts on Livelihoods  Impacts on the environment will have important socio-economic effects', "" The river's annual irrigating and fertilising flood creates a rich area of farmland below the park"", ' Typically, this supports recession agriculture that takes place in the dry season', "" Indeed, the Rufiji valley contains some of Tanzania's richest farmland, including extensive paddy fields"", ' People living in the valley also utilise lakes which are replenished by annual floods', ' These lakes provide a source for irrigation and a useful fish stock', "" Therefore, a change caused by the dam will negatively impact people's livelihoods downstream"", '  Another key impact is on fishing in the Rufiji River delta', "" This area is Tanzania's economically-richest fishery, centred on prawns"", "" Prawns and other fish numbers are underpinned by the river's wet season pulse"", "" Building the Stiegler's Gorge Dam will therefore harm fisheries around the Rufiji delta"", '  Another direct impact of the dam will be on tourism', ' This will be twofold', ' The main photo-tourist area of the Selous is the part of the reserve immediately below the gorge', ' The remainder of the park is for hunting tourism and will be negatively affected by construction', ' The building of the dam will bring a visual impact on this area because of the improved roads and large number of vehicles transporting materials to the dam', ' The hydropower plant will also require transmission lines', ' The Beho Beho Hills will visually shield the dam itself', ' Regardless, the short and long-term negative impacts on the wildlife of the park will undermine the reason for hunting and photo tourism', '  Particularly large Rufiji floods can significantly damage the communities living along the Rufiji River', ' This happened in 1968 for instance  when floods destroyed crops, houses and infrastructure', ' However, research demonstrates that many people living in the valley value such large floods, seeing them as a blessing in the longer term, not a plague', ' This is because of a perception of the floods as agriculturally important', ' Floodwater spreads more sediment creating rich agricultural conditions in for the following years', '  On the other hand, the project is expected to provide employment opportunities and invaluable experience to many Tanzanian engineers', '   See also    List of power stations in Tanzania

comparative studies with a close relative of early hominins: the modern chimpanzee', "" The chimpanzee's diet in the wild consists of only about five percent as meat"", ' And the diets of modern hunter-gatherers do not include a large amount of meat', "" That is, most of the calories in both groups' diets came from plant sources"", ' Thus, it can be assumed that early hominins had similar diet proportions, (see the middle-range theory or bridging arguments—bridging arguments are used by archaeologists to explain past behaviors, and they include an underlying assumption of uniformitarianism', ')  Much of the information about early hominins comes from tools and debris piles of lithic flakes from such sites as FLK-Zinjanthropus in Olduvai Gorge', ' Early hominins selected specific types of rocks that would break in a predictable manner when ""worked"", and carried these rocks from deposits several kilometres away', ' Archaeologists such as Fiona Marshall

successfully produce sharp-edged flakes ', '', '', '""', ' She noted that selected flakes then were used to cut meat from animal carcasses, and shaped cobbles (called choppers) were used to extract marrow and to chop tough  plant material', '  Bone fragments of birds, fish, amphibians, and large mammals were found at the FLK-Zinj site, many of which were scarred with marks', ' These likely were made by hominins breaking open the bones for marrow, using tools to strip the meat, or by carnivores having gnawed the bones', ' Since several kinds of marks are present together, some archaeologists including Lewis Binford think that hominins scavenged the meat or marrow left over from carnivore kills', ' Others like Henry Bunn believe the hominins hunted and killed these animals, and carnivores later chewed the bones', ' This issue is still debated today, but archaeologist Pat Shipman provided evidence that scavenging was probably the more common practice; she published that the majority of carnivore teeth marks came before the cut marks', ' Another finding by Shipman at FLK-Zinj is that many of the wildebeest bones found there are over-represented by adult and male bones; and this may indicate that hominins were systematically hunting these animals as well as scavenging them', ' The issue of hunting versus gathering at Olduvai Gorge is still a controversial one', '  Hominid fossils

The name is one of several toponyms sharing similar etymologies, ultimately meaning ""land of the blacks"" or similar meanings, in reference to the dark skin of the inhabitants', '   History    Pre-1498  The presence of microliths suggests that Zanzibar has been home to humans for at least 20,000 years, which was the beginning of the Later Stone Age', '  A Greco-Roman text between the 1st and 3rd centuries, the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, mentioned the island of Menuthias (), which is probably Unguja', ' Zanzibar, like the nearby coast, was settled by Bantu speakers at the outset of the first millennium', ' Archaeological finds at Fukuchani, on the northwest coast of Zanzibar, indicate a settled agricultural and fishing community from the 6th century at the latest', ' The considerable amount of daub found indicates timber buildings, and shell beads, bead grinders, and iron slag have been found at the site', ' There is evidence of limited engagement in long-distance trade: a small amount of imported pottery has been found, less than 1% of total pottery finds, mostly from the Gulf and dated to the 5th to 8th century', ' The similarity to contemporary sites such as Mkokotoni and Dar es Salaam indicates a unified group of communities that developed into the first center of coastal maritime culture', ' The coastal towns appear to have been engaged in Indian Ocean and inland African trade at this early period', ' Trade rapidly increased in importance and quantity beginning in the mid-8th century and by the close of the 10th century Zanzibar was one of the central Swahili trading towns', '  Excavations at nearby Pemba Island, but especially at Shanga in the Lamu Archipelago, provide the clearest picture of architectural development', ' Houses were originally built with timber (circa 1050) and later in mud with coral walls (circa 1150)', ' The houses were continually rebuilt with more permanent materials', ' By the 13th century, houses were built with stone, and bonded with mud, and the 14th century saw the use of lime to bond stone', ' Only the wealthier patricians would have had stone and lime built houses, the strength of the materials allowing for flat roofs, while the majority of the population lived in single-story thatched houses similar to those from the 11th and 12th centuries', ' According to John Middleton and Mark Horton, the architectural style of these stone houses have no Arab or Persian elements, and should be viewed as an entirely indigenous development of local vernacular architecture', "" While much of Zanzibar Town's architecture was rebuilt during Omani rule, nearby sites elucidate the general development of Swahili, and Zanzibari, architecture before the 15th century"", '  From the 9th century, Swahili merchants on Zanzibar operated as brokers for long-distance traders from both the hinterland and Indian Ocean world', ' Persian, Indian, and Arab traders frequented Zanzibar to acquire East African goods like gold, ivory, and ambergris and then shipped them overseas to Asia', ' Similarly, caravan traders from the African Great Lakes and Zambezian Region came to the coast to trade for imported goods, especially Indian cloth', ' Before the Portuguese arrival, the southern towns of Unguja Ukuu and Kizimkazi and the northern town of Tumbatu were the dominant centers of exchange', ' Zanzibar was just one of the many autonomous city-states that dotted the East African littoral', ' These towns grew in wealth as the Swahili people served as intermediaries and facilitators to merchants and traders', ' This interaction between Central African and Indian Ocean cultures contributed in part to the evolution of the Swahili culture, which developed an Arabic-script literary tradition', ' Although a Bantu language, the Swahili language as a consequence today includes some borrowed elements, particularly loanwords from Arabic, though this was mostly a 19th-century phenomenon with the growth of Omani hegemony', ' Many foreign traders from Africa and Asia married into wealthy patrician families on Zanzibar', ' Particularly Asian men, who ""wintered"" on the coast

this reason, the Zanzibar Archipelago, together with Tanzania\'s Mafia Island, are sometimes referred to locally as the ""Spice Islands""', ' Tourism in Zanzibar is a more recent activity, driven by

serve up to 1', '5 million passengers per year', ""  Zanzibar's marine ecosystem is an important part of the economy for fishing and algaculture and contains important marine ecosystems that act as fish nurseries for Indian Ocean fish populations"", ' Moreover, the land ecosystem is the home of the endemic Zanzibar red colobus, the Zanzibar servaline genet, and the extinct or rare Zanzibar leopard', ' Pressure from the tourist industry and fishing as well as larger threats such as sea level rise caused by climate change are creating increasing environmental concerns throughout the region', '   Etymology  The word Zanzibar came from Arabic zanjibār ( ), which is in turn from Persian zangbâr ( ), a compound of Zang ( , ""black"") + bâr ( , ""coast""), cf', ' the Sea of Zanj', ' The name is one of several toponyms sharing similar etymologies, ultimately meaning ""land of the blacks"" or similar meanings, in reference to the dark skin of the inhabitants', '   History    Pre-1498  The presence of microliths suggests that Zanzibar has been home to humans for at least 20,000 years, which was the beginning of the Later Stone Age', '  A Greco-Roman text between the 1st and 3rd centuries, the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, mentioned the island of Menuthias (), which is probably Unguja', ' Zanzibar, like the nearby coast, was settled by Bantu speakers at the outset of the first millennium', ' Archaeological finds at Fukuchani, on the northwest coast of Zanzibar, indicate a settled agricultural and fishing community from the 6th century at the latest', ' The considerable amount of daub found indicates timber buildings, and shell beads, bead grinders, and iron slag have been found at the site', ' There is evidence of limited engagement in long-distance trade: a small amount of imported pottery has been found, less than 1% of total pottery finds, mostly from the Gulf and dated to the 5th to 8th century', ' The similarity to contemporary sites such as Mkokotoni and Dar es Salaam indicates a unified group of communities that developed into the first center of coastal maritime culture', ' The coastal towns appear to have been engaged in Indian Ocean and inland African trade at this early period', ' Trade rapidly increased in importance and quantity beginning in the mid-8th century and by the close of the 10th century Zanzibar was one of the

originally built with timber (circa 1050) and later in mud with coral walls (circa 1150)', ' The houses were continually rebuilt with more permanent materials', ' By the 13th century, houses were built with stone, and bonded with mud, and the 14th century saw the use of lime to bond stone', ' Only the wealthier patricians would have had stone and lime built houses, the strength of the materials allowing for flat roofs, while the majority of the population lived in single-story thatched houses similar to those from the 11th and 12th centuries', ' According to John Middleton and Mark Horton, the architectural style of these stone houses have no Arab or Persian elements, and should be viewed as an entirely indigenous development of local vernacular architecture', "" While much of Zanzibar Town's architecture was rebuilt during Omani rule, nearby sites elucidate the general development of Swahili, and Zanzibari, architecture before the 15th century"", '  From the 9th century, Swahili merchants on Zanzibar operated as brokers for long-distance traders from both the hinterland and Indian Ocean world', ' Persian, Indian, and Arab traders frequented Zanzibar to acquire East African goods like gold, ivory, and ambergris and then shipped them overseas to Asia', ' Similarly, caravan traders from the African Great Lakes and Zambezian Region came to the coast to trade for imported goods, especially Indian cloth', ' Before the Portuguese arrival, the southern towns of Unguja Ukuu and Kizimkazi and the northern town of Tumbatu were the dominant centers of exchange', ' Zanzibar was just one of the many autonomous city-states that dotted the East African littoral', ' These towns grew in wealth as the Swahili people served as intermediaries and facilitators to merchants and traders', ' This interaction between Central African and Indian Ocean cultures contributed in part to the evolution of the Swahili culture, which developed an Arabic-script literary tradition', ' Although a Bantu language, the Swahili language as a consequence today includes some borrowed elements, particularly loanwords from Arabic, though this was mostly a 19th-century phenomenon with the growth of Omani hegemony', ' Many foreign traders from Africa and Asia married into wealthy patrician families on Zanzibar', ' Particularly Asian men, who ""wintered"" on the coast for up to six months because of the prevailing monsoon wind patterns, married East African women', ' Since most Asian traders were Muslim, their children inherited their paternal ethnic identity,

foreign traders from Africa and Asia married into wealthy patrician families on Zanzibar.Said lost the revenue he would have received as duty on all slaves sold, so to make up for this shortfall he encouraged the development of the slave trade in Zanzibar itself.Christ Church Cathedral, located in Stone Town, Zanzibar City, is a prominent landmark, and a national heritage asset.Pentecostal-Charismatic churches have been present and growing in Zanzibar since the 1980s in relation to economic liberalization and increased labor migration from mainland Tanzania in connection to Zanzibar's expanding tourist sector.Since 2005 there is also an inter-religious body called the Joint Committee of Religious Leaders for Peace (in Swahili Juhudi za Viongozi wa Dini kuimarisha Amani) with representatives from Muslim institutions such as the Islamic law (Kadhi courts), religious property (the Wakf and Trust commission), education (the Muslim academy) and the

population lives below the poverty line.It is estimated that 7% of children on Zanzibar have acute malnutrition.Tourism is a major foreign currency earner.The government has also established a free port area, which provides the following benefits: contribution to economic diversification by providing a window for free trade as well as stimulating the establishment of support services; administration of a regime that imports, exports, and warehouses general merchandise; adequate storage facilities and other infrastructure to cater for effective operation of trade; and creation of an efficient management system for effective re-exportation of goods.In 1992, the government designated two export-producing zones and encouraged the development of offshore financial services.The firm recommended that Zanzibar follow economist Hernando de Soto Polar's ideas about the formalization of property rights for persons living on ancestral land for which they probably do not have a legal deed.The port was rehabilitated between 1989 and 1992 with financial assistance from the European Union.After a long legal battle, the company was required in 2005 by the International Court of

estimated at 4000 plus personnel and a number of sub-contractors', ' Neither company appears to have experience of management on this scale', ' In its most extreme sense, this raises questions about dam safety, both in the construction phases and in the end product', ' A number of dam collapses such as the St', ' Francis Dam (USA)  or Malpasset Dam (France)  stemmed from poor studies and insufficient engineering standards', '  Another risk concerns environmental and social impacts', ' Given inexperience, the companies are unlikely to be familiar with mitigation codes of practice that could limit impacts, e', 'g', ' stopping dumping of soil in the river or in handling waste', ' There are also concerns over dam safety for workers, given the long history of accidents on dam projects before extra industry efforts in the 21st century', '  There are also significant concerns over poaching which has been a longstanding issue in the Selous Game Reserve', ' Poaching was the primary reason for placing the UNESCO World Heritage Selous Game Reserve on a list of endangered sites', ' The increased presence of people and steady flow of construction traffic, as well as logging camps, provides substantive opportunities for poaching and smuggling, especially if the companies do not have knowhow to enforce anti-poaching measures', "" Thus, the choice of the contractors magnify the pre-existing risks of undertaking the Stiegler's Gorge project"", ""  Risks to operation   There are a number of risks to the effective functioning of the Stiegler's Gorge Hydropower Project, if it is

increase"", "" This is important as it will affect hydropower production, decreasing the dam's electricity-generation reliability"", ' This is particularly important in the context of hydro-dependency', ' Tanzania gets the majority of its electricity from hydropower', "" A failure in these dams in the dry season is the key reason for the country's power failures, which happen frequently"", "" This vulnerability will increase if the Stiegler's Gorge Dam is completed"", "" If brought online today, a failure of the Stiegler's Gorge Hydropower Plant would reduce power production by 58"", '3%', '  The other risk comes from sedimentation', ' A report highlighted the vulnerability of the reservoir to rapid sedimentation', ' This is because of the existing sediment load in the Rufiji River and the high levels of erosion likely to occur around the reservoir', "" Higher sedimentation would decrease the reservoir's capacity to store water"", ' Such a reduction would reduce the reliability of the reservoir, as it would make it more directly dependent on precipitation', ""  Another fiscal danger comes from the ability of Tanzania's electricity utility, TANESCO, to sell the hydro-plant's energy"", "" Given Tanzania's current peak capacity of around 1"", '05GW and installed capacity of 1', ""5GW, there are persistent doubts about whether Tanzania can sell the dam's energy"", "" A number of reports cast doubt on the ability of the Tanzanian economy and electrification schemes to absorb the dam's demand"", ' Without such sales, the government will not easily recoup their investment', ' These reports also suggest that selling to the regional grid, to neighbouring countries through the Southern and Eastern African Power Pools, is unlikely to work given that both trading schemes are insufficiently institutionalised', ' There also appears to be a high level of distrust between countries when it comes to relying on others for power', ""  Negative Impacts  Academics and consultants have established the Stiegler's Gorge Dam's impacts"", "" They have argued that the significant level of environmental and social effects constitute an important trade-off in pursuing Stiegler's Gorge Dam"", ""  Environmental impacts  The key controversy of the proposed Stiegler's Gorge project concerns its environmental impacts"", ' An obvious concern is the location of the gorge in the middle of the Selous Game Reserve World Heritage Site', ' Firstly, the dam will flood over 2', ""2% of the reserve's total area, roughly equivalent to the size of Andorra, reducing its forest and riverine habitat"", '  Additionally, the dam project would be directly above the main area of biodiversity in the reserve', ' This consists of a large wetland, marsh and savanna area', ' The Rufiji River plays a central role in creating this environment', ' In the wet season, this river has a particularly strong hydrological surge', "" This force of water during the wet season changes the Rufiji River's path, creating a shifting pattern of oxbow lakes, dried river channels and wetland"", ' Collectively this creates a rich habitat contrasting with surrounding dry savannah', '  The Rufiji River has a strong seasonal variation', ' In the wet season, it floods a large area of land, irrigating the soil and spreading nutrient sediments', ' The wet season also refills and connects lakes in the Selous Reserve', '  Building a dam will change this seasonal river pattern and withhold sediment', ' It will create a more constant hydrological discharge, reducing the wet season flood', ' This will undermine the ecological irrigating and fertilising services of the river', "" The Stiegler's Gorge Dam will therefore harm the wetland areas of the Selous and the wide variety of mammal and bird life that use it, including numerous waders, storks and herons as well as hippo and crocodiles"", ' Large, land-based mammals from elephants to lions also benefit from the presence of the water, particularly in the dry season', '  The Selous contains a number of endangered species, including white and black rhinoceros, lion, cheetah, Sanje crested Mangaby, wetland crane, lesser kestrel, Udzungwa red colobus monkey, Udzungwa forest partridge and rufous-winged partridge', ' Impact assessments indicate these could be affected by a future project', '  The dam will mean that downstream oxbow lakes are cut-off, become more saline from evaporation and will reduce in size', ' Cutting-off the lakes will also prevent the regeneration of fish stocks, particularly migratory fish', ' A study by Duvail et al', ' found that these negative impacts would occur even with a mitigating flood release of 2,500cms', ' For instance, this proposed water release would end at least two of the downstream lakes', '  Below the Selous Game Reserve is the Rufiji River Delta', ' This delta area, including Mafia Island, is protected by the highest international level of wetland protection, called the Ramsar Convention', "" The ecology of this area also depends on the river's seasonal nature"", "" The wet season's river-water surge counteracts the saline sea, maintaining a balance of salinity in the delta that underpins its current plant and animal mix"", ' This salinity balance supports the largest mangrove stand in East Africa', ""  The river's wet season surge, because it brings a large volume of fertile sediments, also supports an algal bloom in the ocean delta"", ' This bloom spawns a rapid annual explosion in plankton, which in-turn supports a rapid increase in fish', ' Migratory whale sharks and other animals also visit the delta area in the wet season to specifically take advantage of this bloom', ""  By altering the river's flow and withholding sediment, the dam will therefore damage the UNESCO Selous Site, downstream lakes and the Ramsar-protected delta area"", '  Social Impacts on Livelihoods  Impacts on the environment will have important socio-economic effects', "" The river's annual irrigating and fertilising flood creates a rich area of farmland below the park"", ' Typically, this supports recession agriculture that takes place in the dry season', "" Indeed, the Rufiji valley contains some of Tanzania's richest farmland, including extensive paddy fields"", ' People living in the valley also utilise lakes which are replenished by annual floods', ' These lakes provide a source for irrigation and a useful fish stock', "" Therefore, a change caused by the dam will negatively impact people's livelihoods downstream"", '  Another key impact is on fishing in the Rufiji River delta', "" This area is Tanzania's economically-richest fishery, centred on prawns"", "" Prawns and other fish numbers are underpinned by the river's wet season pulse"", "" Building the Stiegler's Gorge Dam will therefore harm fisheries around the Rufiji delta"", '  Another direct impact of the dam will be on tourism', ' This will be twofold', ' The main photo-tourist area of the Selous is the part of the reserve immediately below the gorge', ' The remainder of the park is for hunting tourism and will be negatively affected by construction', ' The building of the dam will bring a visual impact on this area because of the improved roads and large number of vehicles transporting materials to the dam', ' The hydropower plant will also require transmission lines', ' The Beho Beho Hills will visually shield the dam itself', ' Regardless, the short and long-term negative impacts on the wildlife of the park will undermine the reason for hunting and photo tourism', '  Particularly large Rufiji floods can significantly damage the communities living along the Rufiji River', ' This happened in 1968 for instance  when floods destroyed crops, houses and infrastructure', ' However, research demonstrates that many people living in the valley value such large floods, seeing them as a blessing in the longer term, not a plague', ' This is because of a perception of the floods as agriculturally important', ' Floodwater spreads more sediment creating rich agricultural conditions in for the following years', '  On the other hand, the project is expected to provide employment opportunities and invaluable experience to many Tanzanian engineers', '   See also    List of power stations in Tanzania

serve up to 1', '5 million passengers per year', ""  Zanzibar's marine ecosystem is an important part of the economy for fishing and algaculture and contains important marine ecosystems that act as fish nurseries for Indian Ocean fish populations"", ' Moreover, the land ecosystem is the home of the endemic Zanzibar red colobus, the Zanzibar servaline genet, and the extinct or rare Zanzibar leopard', ' Pressure from the tourist industry and fishing as well as larger threats such as sea level rise caused by climate change are creating increasing environmental concerns throughout the region', '   Etymology  The word Zanzibar came from Arabic zanjibār ( ), which is in turn from Persian zangbâr ( ), a compound of Zang ( , ""black"") + bâr ( , ""coast""), cf', ' the Sea of Zanj', ' The name is one of several toponyms sharing similar etymologies, ultimately meaning ""land of the blacks"" or similar meanings, in reference to the dark skin of the inhabitants', '   History    Pre-1498  The presence of microliths suggests that Zanzibar has been home to humans for at least 20,000 years, which was the beginning of the Later Stone Age', '  A Greco-Roman text between the 1st and 3rd centuries, the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, mentioned the island of Menuthias (), which is probably Unguja', ' Zanzibar, like the nearby coast, was settled by Bantu speakers at the outset of the first millennium', ' Archaeological finds at Fukuchani, on the northwest coast of Zanzibar, indicate a settled agricultural and fishing community from the 6th century at the latest', ' The considerable amount of daub found indicates timber buildings, and shell beads, bead grinders, and iron slag have been found at the site', ' There is evidence of limited engagement in long-distance trade: a small amount of imported pottery has been found, less than 1% of total pottery finds, mostly from the Gulf and dated to the 5th to 8th century', ' The similarity to contemporary sites such as Mkokotoni and Dar es Salaam indicates a unified group of communities that developed into the first center of coastal maritime culture', ' The coastal towns appear to have been engaged in Indian Ocean and inland African trade at this early period', ' Trade rapidly increased in importance and quantity beginning in the mid-8th century and by the close of the 10th century Zanzibar was one of the central Swahili trading towns', '  Excavations at nearby Pemba Island, but especially at Shanga in the Lamu Archipelago, provide the clearest picture of architectural development', ' Houses were originally built with timber (circa 1050) and later in mud with coral walls (circa 1150)', ' The houses were continually rebuilt with more permanent materials', ' By the 13th century, houses were built with stone, and bonded with mud, and the 14th century saw the use of lime to bond stone', ' Only the wealthier patricians would have had stone and lime built houses, the strength of the materials allowing for flat roofs, while the majority of the population lived in single-story thatched houses similar to those from the 11th and 12th centuries', ' According to John Middleton and Mark Horton, the architectural style of these stone houses have no Arab or Persian elements, and should be viewed as an entirely indigenous development of local vernacular architecture', "" While much of Zanzibar Town's architecture was rebuilt during Omani rule, nearby sites elucidate the general development of Swahili, and Zanzibari, architecture before the 15th century"", '  From the 9th century, Swahili merchants on Zanzibar operated as brokers for long-distance traders from both the hinterland and Indian Ocean world', ' Persian, Indian, and Arab traders frequented Zanzibar to acquire East African goods like gold, ivory, and ambergris and then shipped them overseas to Asia', ' Similarly, caravan traders from the African Great Lakes and Zambezian Region came to the coast to trade for imported goods, especially Indian cloth', ' Before the Portuguese arrival, the southern towns of Unguja Ukuu and Kizimkazi and the northern town of Tumbatu were the dominant centers of exchange', ' Zanzibar was just one of the many autonomous city-states that dotted the East African littoral', ' These towns grew in wealth as the Swahili people served as intermediaries and facilitators to merchants and traders', ' This interaction between Central African and Indian Ocean cultures contributed in part to the evolution of the Swahili culture, which developed an Arabic-script literary tradition', ' Although a Bantu language, the Swahili language as a consequence today includes some borrowed elements, particularly loanwords from Arabic, though this was mostly a 19th-century phenomenon with the growth of Omani hegemony', ' Many foreign traders from Africa and Asia married into wealthy patrician families on Zanzibar', ' Particularly Asian men, who ""wintered"" on the coast for up to six months because of the prevailing monsoon wind patterns, married East African women', ' Since most Asian traders were Muslim, their children inherited their paternal ethnic identity,

leopard', ' Pressure from the tourist industry and fishing as well as larger threats such as sea level rise caused by climate change are creating increasing environmental concerns throughout the region', '   Etymology  The word Zanzibar came from Arabic zanjibār ( ), which is in turn from Persian zangbâr ( ), a compound of Zang ( , ""black"") + bâr ( , ""coast""), cf', ' the Sea of Zanj', ' The name is one of several toponyms sharing similar etymologies, ultimately meaning ""land of the blacks"" or similar meanings, in reference to the dark skin of the inhabitants', '   History    Pre-1498  The presence of microliths suggests that Zanzibar has been home to humans for at least 20,000 years, which was the beginning of the Later Stone Age', '  A Greco-Roman text between the 1st and 3rd centuries, the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, mentioned the island of Menuthias (), which is probably Unguja', ' Zanzibar, like the nearby coast, was settled by Bantu speakers at the outset of the first millennium', ' Archaeological finds at Fukuchani, on the northwest coast of Zanzibar, indicate a settled agricultural and fishing community from the 6th century at the latest', ' The considerable amount of daub found indicates timber buildings, and shell beads, bead grinders, and iron slag have been found at the site', ' There is evidence of limited engagement in long-distance trade: a small amount of imported pottery has been found, less than 1% of total pottery finds, mostly from the Gulf and dated to the 5th to 8th century', ' The similarity to contemporary sites such as Mkokotoni and Dar es Salaam indicates a unified group of communities that developed into the first center of coastal maritime culture', ' The coastal towns appear to have been engaged in Indian Ocean and inland African trade at this early period', ' Trade rapidly increased in importance and quantity beginning in the mid-8th century and by the close of the 10th century Zanzibar was one of the

built with stone, and bonded with mud, and the 14th century saw the use of lime to bond stone', ' Only the wealthier patricians would have had stone and lime built houses, the strength of the materials allowing for flat roofs, while the majority of the population lived in single-story thatched houses similar to those from the 11th and 12th centuries', ' According to John Middleton and Mark Horton, the architectural style of these stone houses have no Arab or Persian elements, and should be viewed as an entirely indigenous development of local vernacular architecture', "" While much of Zanzibar Town's architecture was rebuilt during Omani rule, nearby sites elucidate the general development of Swahili, and Zanzibari, architecture before the 15th century"", '  From the 9th century, Swahili merchants on Zanzibar operated as brokers for long-distance traders from both the hinterland and Indian Ocean world', ' Persian, Indian, and Arab traders frequented Zanzibar to acquire East African goods like gold, ivory, and ambergris and then shipped them overseas to Asia', ' Similarly, caravan traders from the African Great Lakes and Zambezian Region came to the coast to trade for imported goods, especially Indian cloth', ' Before the Portuguese arrival, the southern towns of Unguja Ukuu and Kizimkazi and the northern town of Tumbatu were the dominant centers of exchange', ' Zanzibar was just one of the many autonomous city-states that dotted the East African littoral', ' These towns grew in wealth as the Swahili people served as intermediaries and facilitators to merchants and traders', ' This interaction between Central African and Indian Ocean cultures contributed in part to the evolution of the Swahili culture, which developed an Arabic-script literary tradition', ' Although a Bantu language, the Swahili language as a consequence today includes some borrowed elements, particularly loanwords from Arabic, though this was mostly a 19th-century

foreign traders from Africa and Asia married into wealthy patrician families on Zanzibar.Said lost the revenue he would have received as duty on all slaves sold, so to make up for this shortfall he encouraged the development of the slave trade in Zanzibar itself.Christ Church Cathedral, located in Stone Town, Zanzibar City, is a prominent landmark, and a national heritage asset.Pentecostal-Charismatic churches have been present and growing in Zanzibar since the 1980s in relation to economic liberalization and increased labor migration from mainland Tanzania in connection to Zanzibar's expanding tourist sector.Since 2005 there is also an inter-religious body called the Joint Committee of Religious Leaders for Peace (in Swahili Juhudi za Viongozi wa Dini kuimarisha Amani) with representatives from Muslim institutions such as the Islamic law (Kadhi courts), religious property (the Wakf and Trust commission), education (the Muslim academy) and the Mufti'''s office as well as representatives from the Roman Catholic, the Anglican and the Lutheran church.The reefs are rich in marine biodiversity.The average annual income is US$2500.About half the population lives below the poverty line.It is estimated that 7% of children on Zanzibar have acute malnutrition.Tourism is a major foreign currency earner.The government has also established a free port area, which provides the following benefits: contribution to economic diversification by providing a window for free trade as well as stimulating the establishment of support services; administration of a regime that imports, exports, and warehouses general merchandise; adequate storage facilities and other infrastructure to cater for effective operation of trade; and creation of an efficient management system for effective re-exportation of goods.In 1992, the government designated two export-producing zones and encouraged the development of offshore financial services.The firm recommended that Zanzibar follow economist Hernando de Soto Polar's ideas about the formalization of property rights for persons living on ancestral land for which they probably do not have a legal deed.The port was rehabilitated between 1989 and 1992 with financial assistance from the European Union.After a long legal battle, the company was required in 2005 by the International Court of

became better at making tools, and  transported tools more often', '  Hunters or scavengers? thumb|250px|right|Worked lithic flake Though substantial evidence of hunting and scavenging has been discovered at Olduvai Gorge, it is believed by archaeologists that hominins inhabiting the area between 1', '9 and 1', '7 million years ago spent the majority of their time gathering wild plant foods, such as berries, tubers and roots', ' The earliest hominins most likely did not rely on meat for the bulk of their nutrition', ' Speculation about the amount of meat in their diets is inferred from comparative studies with a close relative of early hominins: the modern chimpanzee', "" The chimpanzee's diet in the wild consists of only about five percent as meat"", ' And the diets of modern hunter-gatherers do not include a large amount of meat', "" That is, most of the calories in both groups' diets came from plant sources"", ' Thus, it can be assumed that early hominins had similar diet proportions, (see the middle-range theory or bridging arguments—bridging arguments are used by archaeologists to explain past behaviors, and they include an underlying assumption of uniformitarianism', ')  Much of the information about early hominins comes from tools and debris piles of lithic flakes from such sites as FLK-Zinjanthropus in Olduvai Gorge', ' Early hominins selected specific types of rocks that would break in a predictable manner when ""worked"", and carried these rocks from deposits several kilometres away', ' Archaeologists such as Fiona Marshall fitted rock fragments back together like a puzzle', ' She states in her article ""Life in Olduvai Gorge"" that early hominins, ""knew the right angle to hit the cobble, or core, in order to successfully produce sharp-edged flakes ', '', '', '""', ' She noted that selected flakes then were used to cut meat from animal carcasses, and shaped cobbles (called choppers) were used to extract marrow and to chop tough  plant material', '  Bone fragments of birds, fish, amphibians, and large mammals were found at the FLK-Zinj site, many of which were scarred with marks', ' These likely were made by hominins breaking open the bones for marrow, using tools to strip the meat, or by carnivores having gnawed the bones', ' Since several kinds of marks are present together, some archaeologists including Lewis Binford think that hominins scavenged the meat or marrow left over from carnivore kills', ' Others like Henry Bunn believe the hominins hunted and killed these animals, and carnivores later chewed the bones', ' This issue is still debated today, but archaeologist Pat Shipman provided evidence that scavenging was probably the more common practice; she published that the majority of carnivore teeth marks came before the cut marks', ' Another finding by Shipman at FLK-Zinj is that many of the wildebeest bones found there are over-represented by adult and male bones; and this may indicate that hominins were systematically hunting these animals as well as scavenging them', ' The issue of hunting versus gathering at Olduvai Gorge is still a controversial one', '  Hominid fossils

political policies, and Kenya's dominant economic position.This body aimed to strengthen the ties between the members through a common market, a common customs tariff, and a range of public services to achieve balanced economic growth within the region.The causes of the collapse included demands by Kenya for more seats than Uganda and Tanzania in decision-making organs, disagreements with Ugandan dictator Idi Amin who demanded that Tanzania as a member state of the EAC should not harbour forces fighting to topple the government of another member state, and the disparate economic systems of socialism in Tanzania and capitalism in Kenya.Kenya, the region's largest exporter, continued to pay duties on goods entering the other four countries on a declining scale until 2010.The expected revenue benefits are understood to be minimal by many analysts, based on comparative-static simulation exercises demonstrating the one-off impacts of the immediate introduction of the CU's full tariff package.The larger economic players perceive long-term benefits in a progressively expanding regional market.Kenya exports financial services, for example via the Kenya Commercial Bank and purchase and upgrading of local operators in Tanzania, Uganda and Sudan.More substantial impact could be attained by a new generation of investments in world-market production based on the region's comparative advantages in natural resources (especially mining and agriculture) and the new tariff structure creates marginally better conditions for world-market exporters, by cheapening inputs and by reducing upward pressures on the exchange rate.Business and finance Many of the EAC's largest firms are headquartered in Nairobi, including Kenya Airways, the Nation Media Group, and the Kenya Commercial Bank Group.However, some experts like those based out of the public think tank Kenya Institute of Public Policy Research and Analysis (KIPPRA), noted that the plans were too ambitious to be met by 2010 because a number of political, social and economic challenges are yet to be addressed"

length increased, and signs of battering on other artifacts increased', ' Some likely implications of these factors, among others, are that after this pivotal time hominins used tools more frequently, became better at making tools, and  transported tools more often', '  Hunters or scavengers? thumb|250px|right|Worked lithic flake Though substantial evidence of hunting and scavenging has been discovered at Olduvai Gorge, it is believed by archaeologists that hominins inhabiting the area between 1', '9 and 1', '7 million years ago spent the majority of their time gathering wild plant foods, such as berries, tubers and roots', ' The earliest hominins most likely did not rely on meat for the bulk of their nutrition', ' Speculation about the amount of meat in their diets is inferred from comparative studies with a close relative of early hominins: the modern chimpanzee', "" The chimpanzee's diet in the wild consists of only about five percent as meat"", ' And the diets of modern hunter-gatherers do not include a large amount of meat', "" That is, most of the calories in both groups' diets came from plant sources"", ' Thus, it can be assumed that early hominins had similar diet proportions, (see the middle-range theory or bridging arguments—bridging arguments are used by archaeologists to explain past behaviors, and they include an underlying assumption of uniformitarianism', ')  Much of the information about early hominins comes from tools and debris piles of lithic flakes from such sites as FLK-Zinjanthropus in Olduvai Gorge', ' Early hominins selected specific types of rocks that would break in a predictable manner when ""worked"", and carried these rocks from deposits several kilometres away', ' Archaeologists such as Fiona Marshall fitted rock fragments back together like a puzzle', ' She states in her article ""Life in Olduvai Gorge"" that early hominins, ""knew the right angle to hit the cobble, or core, in order to successfully produce sharp-edged flakes ', '', '', '""', ' She noted that selected flakes then were used to cut meat from animal carcasses, and shaped cobbles (called choppers) were used to extract marrow and to chop tough  plant material', '  Bone fragments of birds, fish, amphibians, and large mammals were found at the FLK-Zinj site, many of which were scarred with marks', ' These likely were made by hominins breaking open the bones for marrow, using tools to strip the meat, or by carnivores having gnawed the bones', ' Since several kinds of marks are present together, some archaeologists including Lewis Binford think that hominins scavenged the meat or marrow left over from carnivore kills', ' Others like Henry Bunn believe the hominins hunted and killed these animals, and carnivores later chewed the bones', ' This issue is still debated today, but archaeologist Pat Shipman provided evidence that scavenging was probably the more common practice; she published that the majority of carnivore teeth marks came before the cut marks', ' Another finding by Shipman at FLK-Zinj is that many of the wildebeest bones found there are over-represented by adult and male bones; and this may indicate that hominins were systematically hunting these animals as well as scavenging them', ' The issue of hunting versus gathering at Olduvai Gorge is still a controversial one', '  Hominid fossils

political policies, and Kenya's dominant economic position.This body aimed to strengthen the ties between the members through a common market, a common customs tariff, and a range of public services to achieve balanced economic growth within the region.The causes of the collapse included demands by Kenya for more seats than Uganda and Tanzania in decision-making organs, disagreements with Ugandan dictator Idi Amin who demanded that Tanzania as a member state of the EAC should not harbour forces fighting to topple the government of another member state, and the disparate economic systems of socialism in Tanzania and capitalism in Kenya.Kenya, the region's largest exporter, continued to pay duties on goods entering the other four countries on a declining scale until 2010.The expected revenue benefits are understood to be minimal by many analysts, based on comparative-static simulation exercises demonstrating the one-off impacts of the immediate introduction of the CU's full tariff package.The larger economic players perceive long-term benefits in a progressively expanding regional market.Kenya exports financial services, for example via the Kenya Commercial Bank and purchase and upgrading of local operators in Tanzania, Uganda and Sudan.More substantial impact could be attained by a new generation of investments in world-market production based on the region's comparative advantages in natural resources (especially mining and agriculture) and the new tariff structure creates marginally better conditions for world-market exporters, by cheapening inputs and by reducing upward pressures on the exchange rate.Business and finance Many of the EAC's largest firms are headquartered in Nairobi, including Kenya Airways, the Nation Media Group, and the Kenya Commercial Bank

construction of a project that stands up and functions (producing electricity) for the intended 50 years', "" This will depend on the accuracy and rigour of hydrology, sediment, climatic and hydropower studies and the engineers' ability to accurately implement complex designs"", ' There would also be a project management issue in undertaking infrastructure on this scale with recruitment estimated at 4000 plus personnel and a number of sub-contractors', ' Neither company appears to have experience of management on this scale', ' In its most extreme sense, this raises questions about dam safety, both in the construction phases and in the end product', ' A number of dam collapses such as the St', ' Francis Dam (USA)  or Malpasset Dam (France)  stemmed from poor studies and insufficient engineering standards', '  Another risk concerns environmental and social impacts', ' Given inexperience, the companies are unlikely to be familiar with mitigation codes of practice that could limit impacts, e', 'g', ' stopping dumping of soil in the river or in handling waste', ' There are also concerns over dam safety for workers, given the long history of accidents on dam projects before extra industry efforts in the 21st century', '  There are also significant concerns over poaching which has been a longstanding issue in the Selous Game Reserve', ' Poaching was the primary reason for placing the UNESCO World Heritage Selous Game Reserve on a list of endangered sites', ' The increased presence of people and steady flow of construction traffic, as well as logging camps, provides substantive opportunities for poaching and smuggling, especially if the companies do not have knowhow to enforce anti-poaching measures', "" Thus, the choice of the contractors magnify the pre-existing risks of undertaking the Stiegler's Gorge project"", ""  Risks to operation   There are a number of risks to the effective functioning of the Stiegler's Gorge Hydropower Project, if it is completed"", ' One of these comes from climate change', "" It is unclear if the total rainfall in Tanzania will increase or decrease, but studies suggest that precipitation's variability will increase"", "" This is important as it will affect hydropower production, decreasing the dam's electricity-generation reliability"", ' This is particularly important in the context of hydro-dependency', ' Tanzania gets the majority of its electricity from hydropower', "" A failure in these dams in the dry season is the key reason for the country's power failures, which happen frequently"", "" This vulnerability will increase if the Stiegler's Gorge Dam is completed"", "" If brought online today, a failure of the Stiegler's Gorge Hydropower Plant would reduce power production by 58"", '3%', '  The other risk comes from sedimentation', ' A report highlighted the vulnerability of the reservoir to rapid sedimentation', ' This is because of the existing sediment load in the Rufiji River and the high levels of erosion likely to occur around the reservoir', "" Higher sedimentation would decrease the reservoir's capacity to store water"", ' Such a reduction would reduce the reliability of the reservoir, as it would make it more directly dependent on precipitation', ""  Another fiscal danger comes from the ability of Tanzania's electricity utility, TANESCO, to sell the hydro-plant's energy"", "" Given Tanzania's current peak capacity of around 1"", '05GW and installed capacity of 1', ""5GW, there are persistent doubts about whether Tanzania can sell the dam's energy"", "" A number of reports cast doubt on the ability of the Tanzanian economy and electrification schemes to absorb the dam's demand"", ' Without such sales, the government will not easily recoup their investment', ' These reports also suggest that selling to the regional grid, to neighbouring countries through the Southern and Eastern African Power Pools, is unlikely to work given that both trading schemes are insufficiently institutionalised', ' There also appears to be a high level of distrust between countries when it comes to relying on others for power', ""  Negative Impacts  Academics and consultants have established the Stiegler's Gorge Dam's impacts"", "" They have argued that the significant level of environmental and social effects constitute an important trade-off in pursuing Stiegler's Gorge Dam"", ""  Environmental impacts  The key controversy of the proposed Stiegler's Gorge project concerns its environmental impacts"", ' An obvious concern is the location of the gorge in the middle of the Selous Game Reserve World Heritage Site', ' Firstly, the dam will flood over 2', ""2% of the reserve's total area, roughly equivalent to the size of Andorra, reducing its forest and riverine habitat"", '  Additionally, the dam project would be directly above the main area of biodiversity in the reserve', ' This consists of a large wetland, marsh and savanna area', ' The Rufiji River plays a central role in creating this environment', ' In the wet season, this river has a particularly strong hydrological surge', "" This force of water during the wet season changes the Rufiji River's path, creating a shifting pattern of oxbow lakes, dried river channels and wetland"", ' Collectively this creates a rich habitat contrasting with surrounding dry savannah', '  The Rufiji River has a strong seasonal variation', ' In the wet season, it floods a large area of land, irrigating the soil and spreading nutrient sediments', ' The wet season also refills and connects lakes in the Selous Reserve', '  Building a dam will change this seasonal river pattern and withhold sediment', ' It will create a more constant hydrological discharge, reducing the wet season flood', ' This will undermine the ecological irrigating and fertilising services of the river', "" The Stiegler's Gorge Dam will therefore harm the wetland areas of the Selous and the wide variety of mammal and bird life that use it, including numerous waders, storks and herons as well as hippo and crocodiles"", ' Large, land-based mammals from elephants to lions also benefit from the presence of the water, particularly in the dry season', '  The Selous contains a number of endangered species, including white and black rhinoceros, lion, cheetah, Sanje crested Mangaby, wetland crane, lesser kestrel, Udzungwa red colobus monkey, Udzungwa forest partridge and rufous-winged partridge', ' Impact assessments indicate these could be affected by a future project', '  The dam will mean that downstream oxbow lakes are cut-off, become more saline from evaporation and will reduce in size', ' Cutting-off the lakes will also prevent the regeneration of fish stocks, particularly migratory fish', ' A study by Duvail et al', ' found that these negative impacts would occur even with a mitigating flood release of 2,500cms', ' For instance, this proposed water release would end at least two of the downstream lakes', '  Below the Selous Game Reserve is the Rufiji River Delta', ' This delta area, including Mafia Island, is protected by the highest international level of wetland protection, called the Ramsar Convention', "" The ecology of this area also depends on the river's seasonal nature"", "" The wet season's river-water surge counteracts the saline sea, maintaining a balance of salinity in the delta that underpins its current plant and animal mix"", ' This salinity balance supports the largest mangrove stand in East Africa', ""  The river's wet season surge,

centre, Stone Town, is a World Heritage Site', ""  Zanzibar's main industries are spices, raffia, and tourism"", ' In particular, the islands produce cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, and black pepper', ' For this reason, the Zanzibar Archipelago, together with Tanzania\'s Mafia Island, are sometimes referred to locally as the ""Spice Islands""', ' Tourism in Zanzibar is a more recent activity, driven by

serve up to 1', '5 million passengers per year', ""  Zanzibar's marine ecosystem is an important part of the economy for fishing and algaculture and contains important marine ecosystems that act as fish nurseries for Indian Ocean fish populations"", ' Moreover, the land ecosystem is the home of the endemic Zanzibar red colobus, the Zanzibar servaline genet, and the extinct or rare Zanzibar leopard', ' Pressure from the tourist industry and fishing as well as larger threats such as sea level rise caused by climate change are creating increasing environmental concerns throughout the region', '   Etymology  The word Zanzibar came from Arabic zanjibār ( ), which is in turn from Persian zangbâr ( ), a compound of Zang ( , ""black"") + bâr ( , ""coast""), cf', ' the Sea of Zanj', ' The name is one of several toponyms sharing similar etymologies, ultimately meaning ""land of the blacks"" or similar meanings, in reference to the dark skin of the inhabitants', '   History    Pre-1498  The presence of microliths suggests that Zanzibar has been home to humans for at least 20,000 years, which was the beginning of the Later Stone Age', '  A Greco-Roman text between the 1st and 3rd centuries, the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, mentioned the island of Menuthias (), which is probably Unguja', ' Zanzibar, like the nearby coast, was settled by Bantu speakers at the outset of the first millennium', ' Archaeological finds at Fukuchani, on the northwest coast of Zanzibar, indicate a settled agricultural and fishing community from the 6th century at the latest', ' The considerable amount of daub found indicates timber buildings, and shell beads, bead grinders, and iron slag have been found at the site', ' There is evidence of limited engagement in long-distance trade: a small amount of imported pottery has been found, less than 1% of total pottery finds, mostly from the Gulf and dated to the 5th to 8th century', ' The similarity to contemporary sites such as Mkokotoni and Dar es Salaam indicates a unified group of communities that developed into the first center of coastal maritime culture', ' The coastal towns appear to have been engaged in Indian Ocean and inland African trade at this early period', ' Trade rapidly increased in importance and quantity beginning in the mid-8th century and by the close of the 10th century Zanzibar was one of the

originally built with timber (circa 1050) and later in mud with coral walls (circa 1150)', ' The houses were continually rebuilt with more permanent materials', ' By the 13th century, houses were built with stone, and bonded with mud, and the 14th century saw the use of lime to bond stone', ' Only the wealthier patricians would have had stone and lime built houses, the strength of the materials allowing for flat roofs, while the majority of the population lived in single-story thatched houses similar to those from the 11th and 12th centuries', ' According to John Middleton and Mark Horton, the architectural style of these stone houses have no Arab or Persian elements, and should be viewed as an entirely indigenous development of local vernacular architecture', "" While much of Zanzibar Town's architecture was rebuilt during Omani rule, nearby sites elucidate the general development of Swahili, and Zanzibari, architecture before the 15th century"", '  From the 9th century, Swahili merchants on Zanzibar operated as brokers for long-distance traders from both the hinterland and Indian Ocean world', ' Persian, Indian, and Arab traders frequented Zanzibar to acquire East African goods like gold, ivory, and ambergris and then shipped them overseas to Asia', ' Similarly, caravan traders from the African Great Lakes and Zambezian Region came to the coast to trade for imported goods, especially Indian cloth', ' Before the Portuguese arrival, the southern towns of Unguja Ukuu and Kizimkazi and the northern town of Tumbatu were the dominant centers of exchange', ' Zanzibar was just one of the many autonomous city-states that dotted the East African littoral', ' These towns grew in wealth as the Swahili people served as intermediaries and facilitators to merchants and traders', ' This interaction between Central African and Indian Ocean cultures contributed in part to the evolution of the Swahili culture, which developed an Arabic-script literary tradition', ' Although a Bantu language, the Swahili language as a consequence today includes some borrowed elements, particularly loanwords from Arabic, though this was mostly a 19th-century phenomenon with the growth of Omani hegemony', ' Many foreign traders from Africa and Asia married into wealthy patrician families on Zanzibar', ' Particularly Asian men, who ""wintered"" on the coast for up to six months because of the prevailing monsoon wind patterns, married East African women', ' Since most Asian traders were Muslim, their children inherited their paternal ethnic identity,

comparative studies with a close relative of early hominins: the modern chimpanzee', "" The chimpanzee's diet in the wild consists of only about five percent as meat"", ' And the diets of modern hunter-gatherers do not include a large amount of meat', "" That is, most of the calories in both groups' diets came from plant sources"", ' Thus, it can be assumed that early hominins had similar diet proportions, (see the middle-range theory or bridging arguments—bridging arguments are used by archaeologists to explain past behaviors, and they include an underlying assumption of uniformitarianism', ')  Much of the information about early hominins comes from tools and debris piles of lithic flakes from such sites as FLK-Zinjanthropus in Olduvai Gorge', ' Early hominins selected specific types of rocks that would break in a predictable manner when ""worked"", and carried these rocks from deposits several kilometres away', ' Archaeologists such as Fiona Marshall

successfully produce sharp-edged flakes ', '', '', '""', ' She noted that selected flakes then were used to cut meat from animal carcasses, and shaped cobbles (called choppers) were used to extract marrow and to chop tough  plant material', '  Bone fragments of birds, fish, amphibians, and large mammals were found at the FLK-Zinj site, many of which were scarred with marks', ' These likely were made by hominins breaking open the bones for marrow, using tools to strip the meat, or by carnivores having gnawed the bones', ' Since several kinds of marks are present together, some archaeologists including Lewis Binford think that hominins scavenged the meat or marrow left over from carnivore kills', ' Others like Henry Bunn believe the hominins hunted and killed these animals, and carnivores later chewed the bones', ' This issue is still debated today, but archaeologist Pat Shipman provided evidence that scavenging was probably the more common practice; she published that the majority of carnivore teeth marks came before the cut marks', ' Another finding by Shipman at FLK-Zinj is that many of the wildebeest bones found there are over-represented by adult and male bones; and this may indicate that hominins were systematically hunting these animals as well as scavenging them', ' The issue of hunting versus gathering at Olduvai Gorge is still a controversial one', '  Hominid fossils

political policies, and Kenya's dominant economic position.This body aimed to strengthen the ties between the members through a common market, a common customs tariff, and a range of public services to achieve balanced economic growth within the region.The causes of the collapse included demands by Kenya for more seats than Uganda and Tanzania in decision-making organs, disagreements with Ugandan dictator Idi Amin who demanded that Tanzania as a member state of the EAC should not harbour forces fighting to topple the government of another member state, and the disparate economic systems of socialism in Tanzania and capitalism in Kenya.Kenya, the region's largest exporter, continued to pay duties on goods entering the other four countries on a declining scale until 2010.The expected revenue benefits are understood to be minimal by many analysts, based on comparative-static simulation exercises demonstrating the one-off impacts of the immediate introduction of the CU's full tariff package.The larger economic players perceive long-term benefits in a progressively expanding regional market.Kenya exports financial services, for example via the Kenya Commercial Bank and purchase and upgrading of local operators in Tanzania, Uganda and Sudan.More substantial impact could be attained by a new generation of investments in world-market production based on the region's comparative advantages in natural resources (especially mining and agriculture) and the new tariff structure creates marginally better conditions for world-market exporters, by cheapening inputs and by reducing upward pressures on the exchange rate.Business and finance Many of the EAC's largest firms are headquartered in Nairobi, including Kenya Airways, the Nation Media Group, and the Kenya Commercial Bank

made by hominins breaking open the bones for marrow, using tools to strip the meat, or by carnivores having gnawed the bones', ' Since several kinds of marks are present together, some archaeologists including Lewis Binford think that hominins scavenged the meat or marrow left over from carnivore kills', ' Others like Henry Bunn believe the hominins hunted and killed these animals, and carnivores later chewed the bones', ' This issue is still debated today, but archaeologist Pat Shipman provided evidence that scavenging was probably the more common practice; she published that the majority of carnivore teeth marks came before the cut marks', ' Another finding by Shipman at FLK-Zinj is that many of the wildebeest bones found there are over-represented by adult and male bones; and this may indicate that hominins were systematically hunting these animals as well as scavenging them', ' The issue of hunting versus gathering at Olduvai Gorge is still a controversial one', '  Hominid fossils

estimated at 4000 plus personnel and a number of sub-contractors', ' Neither company appears to have experience of management on this scale', ' In its most extreme sense, this raises questions about dam safety, both in the construction phases and in the end product', ' A number of dam collapses such as the St', ' Francis Dam (USA)  or Malpasset Dam (France)  stemmed from poor studies and insufficient engineering standards', '  Another risk concerns environmental and social impacts', ' Given inexperience, the companies are unlikely to be familiar with mitigation codes of practice that could limit impacts, e', 'g', ' stopping dumping of soil in the river or in handling waste', ' There are also concerns over dam safety for workers, given the long history of accidents on dam projects before extra industry efforts in the 21st century', '  There are also significant concerns over poaching which has been a longstanding issue in the Selous Game Reserve', ' Poaching was the primary reason for placing the UNESCO World Heritage Selous Game Reserve on a list of endangered sites', ' The increased presence of people and steady flow of construction traffic, as well as logging camps, provides substantive opportunities for poaching and smuggling, especially if the companies do not have knowhow to enforce anti-poaching measures', "" Thus, the choice of the contractors magnify the pre-existing risks of undertaking the Stiegler's Gorge project"", ""  Risks to operation   There are a number of risks to the effective functioning of the Stiegler's Gorge Hydropower Project, if it is

increase"", "" This is important as it will affect hydropower production, decreasing the dam's electricity-generation reliability"", ' This is particularly important in the context of hydro-dependency', ' Tanzania gets the majority of its electricity from hydropower', "" A failure in these dams in the dry season is the key reason for the country's power failures, which happen frequently"", "" This vulnerability will increase if the Stiegler's Gorge Dam is completed"", "" If brought online today, a failure of the Stiegler's Gorge Hydropower Plant would reduce power production by 58"", '3%', '  The other risk comes from sedimentation', ' A report highlighted the vulnerability of the reservoir to rapid sedimentation', ' This is because of the existing sediment load in the Rufiji River and the high levels of erosion likely to occur around the reservoir', "" Higher sedimentation would decrease the reservoir's capacity to store water"", ' Such a reduction would reduce the reliability of the reservoir, as it would make it more directly dependent on precipitation', ""  Another fiscal danger comes from the ability of Tanzania's electricity utility, TANESCO, to sell the hydro-plant's energy"", "" Given Tanzania's current peak capacity of around 1"", '05GW and installed capacity of 1', ""5GW, there are persistent doubts about whether Tanzania can sell the dam's energy"", "" A number of reports cast doubt on the ability of the Tanzanian economy and electrification schemes to absorb the dam's demand"", ' Without such sales, the government will not easily recoup their investment', ' These reports also suggest that selling to the regional grid, to neighbouring countries through the Southern and Eastern African Power Pools, is unlikely to work given that both trading schemes are insufficiently institutionalised', ' There also appears to be a high level of distrust between countries when it comes to relying on others for power', ""  Negative Impacts  Academics and consultants have established the Stiegler's Gorge Dam's impacts"", "" They have argued that the significant level of environmental and social effects constitute an important trade-off in pursuing Stiegler's Gorge Dam"", ""  Environmental impacts  The key controversy of the proposed Stiegler's Gorge project concerns its environmental impacts"", ' An obvious concern is the location of the gorge in the middle of the Selous Game Reserve World Heritage Site', ' Firstly, the dam will flood over 2', ""2% of the reserve's total area, roughly equivalent to the size of Andorra, reducing its forest and riverine habitat"", '  Additionally, the dam project would be directly above the main area of biodiversity in the reserve', ' This consists of a large wetland, marsh and savanna area', ' The Rufiji River plays a central role in creating this environment', ' In the wet season, this river has a particularly strong hydrological surge', "" This force of water during the wet season changes the Rufiji River's path, creating a shifting pattern of oxbow lakes, dried river channels and wetland"", ' Collectively this creates a rich habitat contrasting with surrounding dry savannah', '  The Rufiji River has a strong seasonal variation', ' In the wet season, it floods a large area of land, irrigating the soil and spreading nutrient sediments', ' The wet season also refills and connects lakes in the Selous Reserve', '  Building a dam will change this seasonal river pattern and withhold sediment', ' It will create a more constant hydrological discharge, reducing the wet season flood', ' This will undermine the ecological irrigating and fertilising services of the river', "" The Stiegler's Gorge Dam will therefore harm the wetland areas of the Selous and the wide variety of mammal and bird life that use it, including numerous waders, storks and herons as well as hippo and crocodiles"", ' Large, land-based mammals from elephants to lions also benefit from the presence of the water, particularly in the dry season', '  The Selous contains a number of endangered species, including white and black rhinoceros, lion, cheetah, Sanje crested Mangaby, wetland crane, lesser kestrel, Udzungwa red colobus monkey, Udzungwa forest partridge and rufous-winged partridge', ' Impact assessments indicate these could be affected by a future project', '  The dam will mean that downstream oxbow lakes are cut-off, become more saline from evaporation and will reduce in size', ' Cutting-off the lakes will also prevent the regeneration of fish stocks, particularly migratory fish', ' A study by Duvail et al', ' found that these negative impacts would occur even with a mitigating flood release of 2,500cms', ' For instance, this proposed water release would end at least two of the downstream lakes', '  Below the Selous Game Reserve is the Rufiji River Delta', ' This delta area, including Mafia Island, is protected by the highest international level of wetland protection, called the Ramsar Convention', "" The ecology of this area also depends on the river's seasonal nature"", "" The wet season's river-water surge counteracts the saline sea, maintaining a balance of salinity in the delta that underpins its current plant and animal mix"", ' This salinity balance supports the largest mangrove stand in East Africa', ""  The river's wet season surge, because it brings a large volume of fertile sediments, also supports an algal bloom in the ocean delta"", ' This bloom spawns a rapid annual explosion in plankton, which in-turn supports a rapid increase in fish', ' Migratory whale sharks and other animals also visit the delta area in the wet season to specifically take advantage of this bloom', ""  By altering the river's flow and withholding sediment, the dam will therefore damage the UNESCO Selous Site, downstream lakes and the Ramsar-protected delta area"", '  Social Impacts on Livelihoods  Impacts on the environment will have important socio-economic effects', "" The river's annual irrigating and fertilising flood creates a rich area of farmland below the park"", ' Typically, this supports recession agriculture that takes place in the dry season', "" Indeed, the Rufiji valley contains some of Tanzania's richest farmland, including extensive paddy fields"", ' People living in the valley also utilise lakes which are replenished by annual floods', ' These lakes provide a source for irrigation and a useful fish stock', "" Therefore, a change caused by the dam will negatively impact people's livelihoods downstream"", '  Another key impact is on fishing in the Rufiji River delta', "" This area is Tanzania's economically-richest fishery, centred on prawns"", "" Prawns and other fish numbers are underpinned by the river's wet season pulse"", "" Building the Stiegler's Gorge Dam will therefore harm fisheries around the Rufiji delta"", '  Another direct impact of the dam will be on tourism', ' This will be twofold', ' The main photo-tourist area of the Selous is the part of the reserve immediately below the gorge', ' The remainder of the park is for hunting tourism and will be negatively affected by construction', ' The building of the dam will bring a visual impact on this area because of the improved roads and large number of vehicles transporting materials to the dam', ' The hydropower plant will also require transmission lines', ' The Beho Beho Hills will visually shield the dam itself', ' Regardless, the short and long-term negative impacts on the wildlife of the park will undermine the reason for hunting and photo tourism', '  Particularly large Rufiji floods can significantly damage the communities living along the Rufiji River', ' This happened in 1968 for instance  when floods destroyed crops, houses and infrastructure', ' However, research demonstrates that many people living in the valley value such large floods, seeing them as a blessing in the longer term, not a plague', ' This is because of a perception of the floods as agriculturally important', ' Floodwater spreads more sediment creating rich agricultural conditions in for the following years', '  On the other hand, the project is expected to provide employment opportunities and invaluable experience to many Tanzanian engineers', '   See also    List of power stations in Tanzania

Pre-1498  The presence of microliths suggests that Zanzibar has been home to humans for at least 20,000 years, which was the beginning of the Later Stone Age', '  A Greco-Roman text between the 1st and 3rd centuries, the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, mentioned the island of Menuthias (), which is probably Unguja', ' Zanzibar, like the nearby coast, was settled by Bantu speakers at the outset of the first millennium', ' Archaeological finds at Fukuchani, on the northwest coast of Zanzibar, indicate a settled agricultural and fishing community from the 6th century at the latest', ' The considerable amount of daub found indicates timber buildings, and shell beads, bead grinders, and iron slag have been found at the site', ' There is evidence of limited engagement in long-distance trade: a small amount of imported pottery has been found, less than 1% of total pottery finds, mostly from the Gulf and dated to the 5th to 8th century', ' The similarity to contemporary sites such as Mkokotoni and Dar es Salaam indicates a unified group of communities that developed into the first center of coastal maritime culture', ' The coastal towns appear to have been engaged in Indian Ocean

originally built with timber (circa 1050) and later in mud with coral walls (circa 1150)', ' The houses were continually rebuilt with more permanent materials', ' By the 13th century, houses were built with stone, and bonded with mud, and the 14th century saw the use of lime to bond stone', ' Only the wealthier patricians would have had stone and lime built houses, the strength of the materials allowing for flat roofs, while the majority of the population lived in single-story thatched houses similar to those from the 11th and 12th centuries', ' According to John Middleton and Mark Horton, the architectural style of these stone houses have no Arab or Persian elements, and should be viewed as an entirely indigenous development of local vernacular architecture', "" While much of Zanzibar Town's architecture was rebuilt during Omani rule, nearby sites elucidate the general development of Swahili, and Zanzibari, architecture before the 15th century"", '  From the 9th century, Swahili merchants on Zanzibar operated as brokers for long-distance traders from both the hinterland and Indian Ocean world', ' Persian, Indian, and Arab traders frequented Zanzibar to acquire East African goods like gold, ivory, and ambergris and then shipped them overseas to Asia', ' Similarly, caravan traders from the African Great Lakes and Zambezian Region came to the coast to trade for imported goods, especially Indian cloth', ' Before the Portuguese arrival, the southern towns of Unguja Ukuu and Kizimkazi and the northern town of Tumbatu were the dominant centers of exchange', ' Zanzibar was just one of the many autonomous city-states that dotted the East African littoral', ' These towns grew in wealth as the Swahili people served as intermediaries and facilitators to merchants and traders', ' This interaction between Central African and Indian Ocean cultures contributed in part to the evolution of the Swahili culture, which developed an Arabic-script literary tradition', ' Although a Bantu language, the Swahili language as a consequence today includes some borrowed elements, particularly loanwords from Arabic, though this was mostly a 19th-century

estimated at 4000 plus personnel and a number of sub-contractors', ' Neither company appears to have experience of management on this scale', ' In its most extreme sense, this raises questions about dam safety, both in the construction phases and in the end product', ' A number of dam collapses such as the St', ' Francis Dam (USA)  or Malpasset Dam (France)  stemmed from poor studies and insufficient engineering standards', '  Another risk concerns environmental and social impacts', ' Given inexperience, the companies are unlikely to be familiar with mitigation codes of practice that could limit impacts, e', 'g', ' stopping dumping of soil in the river or in handling waste', ' There are also concerns over dam safety for workers, given the long history of accidents on dam projects before extra industry efforts in the 21st century', '  There are also significant concerns over poaching which has been a longstanding issue in the Selous Game Reserve', ' Poaching was the primary reason for placing the UNESCO World Heritage Selous Game Reserve on a list of endangered sites', ' The increased presence of people and steady flow of construction traffic, as well as logging camps, provides substantive opportunities for poaching and smuggling, especially if the companies do not have knowhow to enforce anti-poaching measures', "" Thus, the choice of the contractors magnify the pre-existing risks of undertaking the Stiegler's Gorge project"", ""  Risks to operation   There are a number of risks to the effective functioning of the Stiegler's Gorge Hydropower Project, if it is

increase"", "" This is important as it will affect hydropower production, decreasing the dam's electricity-generation reliability"", ' This is particularly important in the context of hydro-dependency', ' Tanzania gets the majority of its electricity from hydropower', "" A failure in these dams in the dry season is the key reason for the country's power failures, which happen frequently"", "" This vulnerability will increase if the Stiegler's Gorge Dam is completed"", "" If brought online today, a failure of the Stiegler's Gorge Hydropower Plant would reduce power production by 58"", '3%', '  The other risk comes from sedimentation', ' A report highlighted the vulnerability of the reservoir to rapid sedimentation', ' This is because of the existing sediment load in the Rufiji River and the high levels of erosion likely to occur around the reservoir', "" Higher sedimentation would decrease the reservoir's capacity to store water"", ' Such a reduction would reduce the reliability of the reservoir, as it would make it more directly dependent on precipitation', ""  Another fiscal danger comes from the ability of Tanzania's electricity utility, TANESCO, to sell the hydro-plant's energy"", "" Given Tanzania's current peak capacity of around 1"", '05GW and installed capacity of 1', ""5GW, there are persistent doubts about whether Tanzania can sell the dam's energy"", "" A number of reports cast doubt on the ability of the Tanzanian economy and electrification schemes to absorb the dam's demand"", ' Without such sales, the government will not easily recoup their investment', ' These reports also suggest that selling to the regional grid, to neighbouring countries through the Southern and Eastern African Power Pools, is unlikely to work given that both trading schemes are insufficiently institutionalised', ' There also appears to be a high level of distrust between countries when it comes to relying on others for power', ""  Negative Impacts  Academics and consultants have established the Stiegler's Gorge Dam's impacts"", "" They have argued that the significant level of environmental and social effects constitute an important trade-off in pursuing Stiegler's Gorge Dam"", ""  Environmental impacts  The key controversy of the proposed Stiegler's Gorge project concerns its environmental impacts"", ' An obvious concern is the location of the gorge in the middle of the Selous Game Reserve World Heritage Site', ' Firstly, the dam will flood over 2', ""2% of the reserve's total area, roughly equivalent to the size of Andorra, reducing its forest and riverine habitat"", '  Additionally, the dam project would be directly above the main area of biodiversity in the reserve', ' This consists of a large wetland, marsh and savanna area', ' The Rufiji River plays a central role in creating this environment', ' In the wet season, this river has a particularly strong hydrological surge', "" This force of water during the wet season changes the Rufiji River's path, creating a shifting pattern of oxbow lakes, dried river channels and wetland"", ' Collectively this creates a rich habitat contrasting with surrounding dry savannah', '  The Rufiji River has a strong seasonal variation', ' In the wet season, it floods a large area of land, irrigating the soil and spreading nutrient sediments', ' The wet season also refills and connects lakes in the Selous Reserve', '  Building a dam will change this seasonal river pattern and withhold sediment', ' It will create a more constant hydrological discharge, reducing the wet season flood', ' This will undermine the ecological irrigating and fertilising services of the river', "" The Stiegler's Gorge Dam will therefore harm the wetland areas of the Selous and the wide variety of mammal and bird life that use it, including numerous waders, storks and herons as well as hippo and crocodiles"", ' Large, land-based mammals from elephants to lions also benefit from the presence of the water, particularly in the dry season', '  The Selous contains a number of endangered species, including white and black rhinoceros, lion, cheetah, Sanje crested Mangaby, wetland crane, lesser kestrel, Udzungwa red colobus monkey, Udzungwa forest partridge and rufous-winged partridge', ' Impact assessments indicate these could be affected by a future project', '  The dam will mean that downstream oxbow lakes are cut-off, become more saline from evaporation and will reduce in size', ' Cutting-off the lakes will also prevent the regeneration of fish stocks, particularly migratory fish', ' A study by Duvail et al', ' found that these negative impacts would occur even with a mitigating flood release of 2,500cms', ' For instance, this proposed water release would end at least two of the downstream lakes', '  Below the Selous Game Reserve is the Rufiji River Delta', ' This delta area, including Mafia Island, is protected by the highest international level of wetland protection, called the Ramsar Convention', "" The ecology of this area also depends on the river's seasonal nature"", "" The wet season's river-water surge counteracts the saline sea, maintaining a balance of salinity in the delta that underpins its current plant and animal mix"", ' This salinity balance supports the largest mangrove stand in East Africa', ""  The river's wet season surge, because it brings a large volume of fertile sediments, also supports an algal bloom in the ocean delta"", ' This bloom spawns a rapid annual explosion in plankton, which in-turn supports a rapid increase in fish', ' Migratory whale sharks and other animals also visit the delta area in the wet season to specifically take advantage of this bloom', ""  By altering the river's flow and withholding sediment, the dam will therefore damage the UNESCO Selous Site, downstream lakes and the Ramsar-protected delta area"", '  Social Impacts on Livelihoods  Impacts on the environment will have important socio-economic effects', "" The river's annual irrigating and fertilising flood creates a rich area of farmland below the park"", ' Typically, this supports recession agriculture that takes place in the dry season', "" Indeed, the Rufiji valley contains some of Tanzania's richest farmland, including extensive paddy fields"", ' People living in the valley also utilise lakes which are replenished by annual floods', ' These lakes provide a source for irrigation and a useful fish stock', "" Therefore, a change caused by the dam will negatively impact people's livelihoods downstream"", '  Another key impact is on fishing in the Rufiji River delta', "" This area is Tanzania's economically-richest fishery, centred on prawns"", "" Prawns and other fish numbers are underpinned by the river's wet season pulse"", "" Building the Stiegler's Gorge Dam will therefore harm fisheries around the Rufiji delta"", '  Another direct impact of the dam will be on tourism', ' This will be twofold', ' The main photo-tourist area of the Selous is the part of the reserve immediately below the gorge', ' The remainder of the park is for hunting tourism and will be negatively affected by construction', ' The building of the dam will bring a visual impact on this area because of the improved roads and large number of vehicles transporting materials to the dam', ' The hydropower plant will also require transmission lines', ' The Beho Beho Hills will visually shield the dam itself', ' Regardless, the short and long-term negative impacts on the wildlife of the park will undermine the reason for hunting and photo tourism', '  Particularly large Rufiji floods can significantly damage the communities living along the Rufiji River', ' This happened in 1968 for instance  when floods destroyed crops, houses and infrastructure', ' However, research demonstrates that many people living in the valley value such large floods, seeing them as a blessing in the longer term, not a plague', ' This is because of a perception of the floods as agriculturally important', ' Floodwater spreads more sediment creating rich agricultural conditions in for the following years', '  On the other hand, the project is expected to provide employment opportunities and invaluable experience to many Tanzanian engineers', '   See also    List of power stations in Tanzania

length increased, and signs of battering on other artifacts increased', ' Some likely implications of these factors, among others, are that after this pivotal time hominins used tools more frequently, became better at making tools, and  transported tools more often', '  Hunters or scavengers? thumb|250px|right|Worked lithic flake Though substantial evidence of hunting and scavenging has been discovered at Olduvai Gorge, it is believed by archaeologists that hominins inhabiting the area between 1', '9 and 1', '7 million years ago spent the majority of their time gathering wild plant foods, such as berries, tubers and roots', ' The earliest hominins most likely did not rely on meat for the bulk of their nutrition', ' Speculation about the amount of meat in their diets is inferred from comparative studies with a close relative of early hominins: the modern chimpanzee', "" The chimpanzee's diet in the wild consists of only about five percent as meat"", ' And the diets of modern hunter-gatherers do not include a large amount of meat', "" That is, most of the calories in both groups' diets came from plant sources"", ' Thus, it can be assumed that early hominins had similar diet proportions, (see the middle-range theory or bridging arguments—bridging arguments are used by archaeologists to explain past behaviors, and they include an underlying assumption of uniformitarianism', ')  Much of the information about early hominins comes from tools and debris piles of lithic flakes from such sites as FLK-Zinjanthropus in Olduvai Gorge', ' Early hominins selected specific types of rocks that would break in a predictable manner when ""worked"", and carried these rocks from deposits several kilometres away', ' Archaeologists such as Fiona Marshall fitted rock fragments back together like a puzzle', ' She states in her article ""Life in Olduvai Gorge"" that early hominins, ""knew the right angle to hit the cobble, or core, in order to successfully produce sharp-edged flakes ', '', '', '""', ' She noted that selected flakes then were used to cut meat from animal carcasses, and shaped cobbles (called choppers) were used to extract marrow and to chop tough  plant material', '  Bone fragments of birds, fish, amphibians, and large mammals were found at the FLK-Zinj site, many of which were scarred with marks', ' These likely were made by hominins breaking open the bones for marrow, using tools to strip the meat, or by carnivores having gnawed the bones', ' Since several kinds of marks are present together, some archaeologists including Lewis Binford think that hominins scavenged the meat or marrow left over from carnivore kills', ' Others like Henry Bunn believe the hominins hunted and killed these animals, and carnivores later chewed the bones', ' This issue is still debated today, but archaeologist Pat Shipman provided evidence that scavenging was probably the more common practice; she published that the majority of carnivore teeth marks came before the cut marks', ' Another finding by Shipman at FLK-Zinj is that many of the wildebeest bones found there are over-represented by adult and male bones; and this may indicate that hominins were systematically hunting these animals as well as scavenging them', ' The issue of hunting versus gathering at Olduvai Gorge is still a controversial one', '  Hominid fossils

made by hominins breaking open the bones for marrow, using tools to strip the meat, or by carnivores having gnawed the bones', ' Since several kinds of marks are present together, some archaeologists including Lewis Binford think that hominins scavenged the meat or marrow left over from carnivore kills', ' Others like Henry Bunn believe the hominins hunted and killed these animals, and carnivores later chewed the bones', ' This issue is still debated today, but archaeologist Pat Shipman provided evidence that scavenging was probably the more common practice; she published that the majority of carnivore teeth marks came before the cut marks', ' Another finding by Shipman at FLK-Zinj is that many of the wildebeest bones found there are over-represented by adult and male bones; and this may indicate that hominins were systematically hunting these animals as well as scavenging them', ' The issue of hunting versus gathering at Olduvai Gorge is still a controversial one', '  Hominid fossils

reason for placing the UNESCO World Heritage Selous Game Reserve on a list of endangered sites', ' The increased presence of people and steady flow of construction traffic, as well as logging camps, provides substantive opportunities for poaching and smuggling, especially if the companies do not have knowhow to enforce anti-poaching measures', "" Thus, the choice of the contractors magnify the pre-existing risks of undertaking the Stiegler's Gorge project"", ""  Risks to operation   There are a number of risks to the effective functioning of the Stiegler's Gorge Hydropower Project, if it is

hydro-dependency', ' Tanzania gets the majority of its electricity from hydropower', "" A failure in these dams in the dry season is the key reason for the country's power failures, which happen frequently"", "" This vulnerability will increase if the Stiegler's Gorge Dam is completed"", "" If brought online today, a failure of the Stiegler's Gorge Hydropower Plant would reduce power production by 58"", '3%', '  The other risk comes from sedimentation', ' A report highlighted the vulnerability of the reservoir to rapid sedimentation', ' This is because of the existing sediment load in the Rufiji River and the high levels of erosion likely to occur around the reservoir', "" Higher sedimentation would decrease the reservoir's capacity to store water"", ' Such a reduction would reduce the reliability of the reservoir, as it would make it more directly dependent on precipitation', ""  Another fiscal danger comes from the ability of Tanzania's electricity utility, TANESCO, to sell the hydro-plant's energy"", "" Given Tanzania's current peak capacity of around 1"", '05GW and installed capacity of 1', ""5GW, there are persistent doubts about whether Tanzania can sell the dam's energy"", "" A number of reports cast doubt on the ability of the Tanzanian economy and electrification schemes to absorb the dam's demand"", ' Without such sales, the government will not easily recoup their investment', ' These reports also suggest that selling to the regional grid, to neighbouring countries through the Southern and Eastern African Power Pools, is unlikely to work given that both trading schemes are insufficiently institutionalised', ' There also appears to be a high level of distrust between countries when it comes to relying on others for power', ""  Negative Impacts  Academics and consultants have established the Stiegler's Gorge Dam's impacts"", "" They have argued that the significant level of environmental and social effects constitute an important trade-off in pursuing Stiegler's Gorge Dam"", ""  Environmental impacts  The key controversy of the proposed Stiegler's Gorge project concerns its environmental impacts"", ' An obvious concern is the location of the gorge in the middle of the Selous Game Reserve World Heritage Site', ' Firstly, the dam will flood over 2', ""2% of the reserve's total area, roughly equivalent to the size of Andorra, reducing its forest and riverine habitat"", '  Additionally, the dam project would be directly above the main area of biodiversity in the reserve', ' This consists of a large wetland, marsh and savanna area', ' The Rufiji River plays a central role in creating this environment', ' In the wet season, this river has a particularly strong hydrological surge', "" This force of water during the wet season changes the Rufiji River's path, creating a shifting pattern of oxbow lakes, dried river channels and wetland"", ' Collectively this creates a rich habitat contrasting with surrounding dry savannah', '  The Rufiji River has a strong seasonal variation', ' In the wet season, it floods a large area of land, irrigating the soil and spreading nutrient sediments', ' The wet season also refills and connects lakes in the Selous Reserve', '  Building a dam will change this seasonal river pattern and withhold sediment', ' It will create a more constant hydrological discharge, reducing the wet season flood', ' This will undermine the ecological irrigating and fertilising services of the river', "" The Stiegler's Gorge Dam will therefore harm the wetland areas of the Selous and the wide variety of mammal and bird life that use it, including numerous waders, storks and herons as well as hippo and crocodiles"", ' Large, land-based mammals from elephants to lions also benefit from the presence of the water, particularly in the dry season', '  The Selous contains a number of endangered species, including white and black rhinoceros, lion, cheetah, Sanje crested Mangaby, wetland crane, lesser kestrel, Udzungwa red colobus monkey, Udzungwa forest partridge and rufous-winged partridge', ' Impact assessments indicate these could be affected by a future project', '  The dam will mean that downstream oxbow lakes are cut-off, become more saline from evaporation and will reduce in size', ' Cutting-off the lakes will also prevent the regeneration of fish stocks, particularly migratory fish', ' A study by Duvail et al', ' found that these negative impacts would occur even with a mitigating flood release of 2,500cms', ' For instance, this proposed water release would end at least two of the downstream lakes', '  Below the Selous Game Reserve is the Rufiji River Delta', ' This delta area, including Mafia Island, is protected by the highest international level of wetland protection, called the Ramsar Convention', "" The ecology of this area also depends on the river's seasonal nature"", "" The wet season's river-water surge counteracts the saline sea, maintaining a balance of salinity in the delta that underpins its current plant and animal mix"", ' This salinity balance supports the largest mangrove stand in East Africa', ""  The river's wet season surge, because it brings a large volume of fertile sediments, also supports an algal bloom in the ocean delta"", ' This bloom spawns a rapid annual explosion in plankton, which in-turn supports a rapid increase in fish', ' Migratory whale sharks and other animals also visit the delta area in the wet season to specifically take advantage of this bloom', ""  By altering the river's flow and withholding sediment, the dam will therefore damage the UNESCO Selous Site, downstream lakes and the Ramsar-protected delta area"", '  Social Impacts on Livelihoods  Impacts on the environment will have important socio-economic effects', "" The river's annual irrigating and fertilising flood creates a rich area of farmland below the park"", ' Typically, this supports recession agriculture that takes place in the dry season', "" Indeed, the Rufiji valley contains some of Tanzania's richest farmland, including extensive paddy fields"", ' People living in the valley also utilise lakes which are replenished by annual floods', ' These lakes provide a source for irrigation and a useful fish stock', "" Therefore, a change caused by the dam will negatively impact people's livelihoods downstream"", '  Another key impact is on fishing in the Rufiji River delta', "" This area is Tanzania's economically-richest fishery, centred on prawns"", "" Prawns and other fish numbers are underpinned by the river's wet season pulse"", "" Building the Stiegler's Gorge Dam will therefore harm fisheries around the Rufiji delta"", '  Another direct impact of the dam will be on tourism', ' This will be twofold', ' The main photo-tourist area of the Selous is the part of the reserve immediately below the gorge', ' The remainder of the park is for hunting tourism and will be negatively affected by construction', ' The building of the dam will bring a visual impact on this area because of the improved roads and large number of vehicles transporting materials to the dam', ' The hydropower plant will also require transmission lines', ' The Beho Beho Hills will visually shield the dam itself', ' Regardless, the short and long-term negative impacts on the wildlife of the park will undermine the reason for hunting and photo tourism', '  Particularly large Rufiji floods can significantly damage the communities living along the Rufiji River', ' This happened in 1968 for instance  when floods destroyed crops, houses and infrastructure', ' However, research demonstrates that many people living in the valley value such large floods, seeing them as a blessing in the longer term, not a plague', ' This is because of a perception of the floods as agriculturally important', ' Floodwater spreads more sediment creating rich agricultural conditions in for the following years', '  On the other hand, the project is expected to provide employment opportunities and invaluable experience to many Tanzanian engineers', '   See also    List of power stations in Tanzania

serve up to 1', '5 million passengers per year', ""  Zanzibar's marine ecosystem is an important part of the economy for fishing and algaculture and contains important marine ecosystems that act as fish nurseries for Indian Ocean fish populations"", ' Moreover, the land ecosystem is the home of the endemic Zanzibar red colobus, the Zanzibar servaline genet, and the extinct or rare Zanzibar leopard', ' Pressure from the tourist industry and fishing as well as larger threats such as sea level rise caused by climate change are creating increasing environmental concerns throughout the region', '   Etymology  The word Zanzibar came from Arabic zanjibār ( ), which is in turn from Persian zangbâr ( ), a compound of Zang ( , ""black"") + bâr ( , ""coast""), cf', ' the Sea of Zanj', ' The name is one of several toponyms sharing similar etymologies, ultimately meaning ""land of the blacks"" or similar meanings, in reference to the dark skin of the inhabitants', '   History    Pre-1498  The presence of microliths suggests that Zanzibar has been home to humans for at least 20,000 years, which was the beginning of the Later Stone Age', '  A Greco-Roman text between the 1st and 3rd centuries, the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, mentioned the island of Menuthias (), which is probably Unguja', ' Zanzibar, like the nearby coast, was settled by Bantu speakers at the outset of the first millennium', ' Archaeological finds at Fukuchani, on the northwest coast of Zanzibar, indicate a settled agricultural and fishing community from the 6th century at the latest', ' The considerable amount of daub found indicates timber buildings, and shell beads, bead grinders, and iron slag have been found at the site', ' There is evidence of limited engagement in long-distance trade: a small amount of imported pottery has been found, less than 1% of total pottery finds, mostly from the Gulf and dated to the 5th to 8th century', ' The similarity to contemporary sites such as Mkokotoni and Dar es Salaam indicates a unified group of communities that developed into the first center of coastal maritime culture', ' The coastal towns appear to have been engaged in Indian Ocean and inland African trade at this early period', ' Trade rapidly increased in importance and quantity beginning in the mid-8th century and by the close of the 10th century Zanzibar was one of the

originally built with timber (circa 1050) and later in mud with coral walls (circa 1150)', ' The houses were continually rebuilt with more permanent materials', ' By the 13th century, houses were built with stone, and bonded with mud, and the 14th century saw the use of lime to bond stone', ' Only the wealthier patricians would have had stone and lime built houses, the strength of the materials allowing for flat roofs, while the majority of the population lived in single-story thatched houses similar to those from the 11th and 12th centuries', ' According to John Middleton and Mark Horton, the architectural style of these stone houses have no Arab or Persian elements, and should be viewed as an entirely indigenous development of local vernacular architecture', "" While much of Zanzibar Town's architecture was rebuilt during Omani rule, nearby sites elucidate the general development of Swahili, and Zanzibari, architecture before the 15th century"", '  From the 9th century, Swahili merchants on Zanzibar operated as brokers for long-distance traders from both the hinterland and Indian Ocean world', ' Persian, Indian, and Arab traders frequented Zanzibar to acquire East African goods like gold, ivory, and ambergris and then shipped them overseas to Asia', ' Similarly, caravan traders from the African Great Lakes and Zambezian Region came to the coast to trade for imported goods, especially Indian cloth', ' Before the Portuguese arrival, the southern towns of Unguja Ukuu and Kizimkazi and the northern town of Tumbatu were the dominant centers of exchange', ' Zanzibar was just one of the many autonomous city-states that dotted the East African littoral', ' These towns grew in wealth as the Swahili people served as intermediaries and facilitators to merchants and traders', ' This interaction between Central African and Indian Ocean cultures contributed in part to the evolution of the Swahili culture, which developed an Arabic-script literary tradition', ' Although a Bantu language, the Swahili language as a consequence today includes some borrowed elements, particularly loanwords from Arabic, though this was mostly a 19th-century phenomenon with the growth of Omani hegemony', ' Many foreign traders from Africa and Asia married into wealthy patrician families on Zanzibar', ' Particularly Asian men, who ""wintered"" on the coast

construction', ' The nine turbines are each to have a capacity of 235MW', '  Foundation for the power house was also in progress', ""  Construction Risks  The Stiegler's Gorge Dam's financial costs are contested"", ' When Odebrecht rewrote feasibility and design studies for the dam in 2013, they estimated that it would cost £3', '6 billion', ' The government used this figure in announcing the new design and feasibility study in 2018', ' However, Hartmann claims the underlying costs have changed, in the price of concrete and construction costs and in engineering services', ' Using contemporary dam cases, he suggests that, after excluding socio-environmental mitigation, the current cost estimation should be US$7', '57billion, rising to US$9', '8billion if a conservative amount of overrun is factored in', ""  Tanzania has not announced any funding agreements for the dam's construction"", "" Given the country's economy and tax base, there are doubts about whether the government has sufficient revenue to build the dam"", "" These are particularly relevant given specific outstanding debt issues with the electricity utility, who has signed the contracts for the Stiegler's Gorge Dam's construction"", ' This financial situation could delay or stop payments to the contractors which would harm or derail construction', '  Additional risks come from the choice of the two contractors', ' According to their public profiles, Dye claims that neither company has had experience of dam construction, and rather primarily builds commercial and residential buildings and transmission lines', ""   This lack of experience is notable given the size of Stiegler's Gorge Dam and the degree of hydrological flux in the Rufiji River"", "" There has not been a supervising, 'owner's engineer' appointed to ensure the quality of construction"", '  This contracting arrangement and the appointed companies entail important risks', ' Some of these are technical, concerning the construction of a project that stands up and functions (producing electricity) for the intended 50 years', "" This will depend on the accuracy and rigour of hydrology, sediment, climatic and hydropower studies and the engineers' ability to accurately implement complex designs"", ' There would also be a project management issue in undertaking infrastructure on this scale with recruitment estimated at 4000 plus personnel and a number of sub-contractors', ' Neither company appears to have experience of management on this scale', ' In its most extreme sense, this raises questions about dam safety, both in the construction phases and in the end product', ' A number of dam collapses such as the St', ' Francis Dam (USA)  or Malpasset Dam (France)  stemmed from poor studies and insufficient engineering standards', '  Another risk concerns environmental and social impacts', ' Given inexperience, the companies are unlikely to be familiar with mitigation codes of practice that could limit impacts, e', 'g', ' stopping dumping of soil in the river or in handling waste', ' There are also concerns over dam safety for workers, given the long history of accidents on dam projects before extra industry efforts in the 21st century', '  There are also significant concerns over poaching which has been a longstanding issue in the Selous Game Reserve', ' Poaching was the primary reason for placing the UNESCO World Heritage Selous Game Reserve on a list of endangered sites', ' The increased presence of people and steady flow of construction traffic, as well as logging camps, provides substantive opportunities for poaching and smuggling, especially if the companies do not have knowhow to enforce anti-poaching measures', "" Thus, the choice of the contractors magnify the pre-existing risks of undertaking the Stiegler's Gorge project"", ""  Risks to operation   There are a number of risks to the effective functioning of the Stiegler's Gorge Hydropower Project, if it is completed"", ' One of these comes from climate change', "" It is unclear if the total rainfall in Tanzania will increase or decrease, but studies suggest that precipitation's variability will increase"", "" This is important as it will affect hydropower production, decreasing the dam's electricity-generation reliability"", ' This is particularly important in the context of hydro-dependency', ' Tanzania gets the majority of its electricity from hydropower', "" A failure in these dams in the dry season is the key reason for the country's power failures, which happen frequently"", "" This vulnerability will increase if the Stiegler's Gorge Dam is completed"", "" If brought online today, a failure of the Stiegler's Gorge Hydropower Plant would reduce power production by 58"", '3%', '  The other risk comes from sedimentation', ' A report highlighted the vulnerability of the reservoir to rapid sedimentation', ' This is because of the existing sediment load in the Rufiji River and the high levels of erosion likely to occur around the reservoir', "" Higher sedimentation would decrease the reservoir's capacity to store water"", ' Such a reduction would reduce the reliability of the reservoir, as it would make it more directly dependent on precipitation', ""  Another fiscal danger comes from the ability of Tanzania's electricity utility, TANESCO, to sell the hydro-plant's energy"", "" Given Tanzania's current peak capacity of around 1"", '05GW and installed capacity of 1', ""5GW, there are persistent doubts about whether Tanzania can sell the dam's energy"", "" A number of reports cast doubt on the ability of the Tanzanian economy and electrification schemes to absorb the dam's demand"", ' Without such sales, the government will not easily recoup their investment', ' These reports also suggest that selling to the regional grid, to neighbouring countries through the Southern and Eastern African Power Pools, is unlikely to work given that both trading schemes are insufficiently institutionalised', ' There also appears to be a high level of distrust between countries when it comes to relying on others for power', ""  Negative Impacts  Academics and consultants have established the Stiegler's Gorge Dam's impacts"", "" They have argued that the significant level of environmental and social effects constitute an important trade-off in pursuing Stiegler's Gorge Dam"", ""  Environmental impacts  The key controversy of the proposed Stiegler's Gorge project concerns its environmental impacts"", ' An obvious concern is the location of the gorge in the middle of the Selous Game Reserve World Heritage Site', ' Firstly, the dam will flood over 2', ""2% of the reserve's total area, roughly equivalent to the size of Andorra, reducing its forest and riverine habitat"", '  Additionally, the dam project would be directly above the main area of biodiversity in the reserve', ' This consists of a large wetland, marsh and savanna area', ' The Rufiji River plays a central role in creating this environment', ' In the wet season, this river has a particularly strong hydrological surge', "" This force of water during the wet season changes the Rufiji River's path, creating a shifting pattern of oxbow lakes, dried river channels and wetland"", ' Collectively this creates a rich habitat contrasting with surrounding dry savannah', '  The Rufiji River has a strong seasonal variation', ' In the wet season, it floods a large area of land, irrigating the soil and spreading nutrient sediments', ' The wet season also refills and connects lakes in the Selous Reserve', '  Building a dam will change this seasonal river pattern and withhold sediment', ' It will create a more constant hydrological discharge, reducing the wet season flood', ' This will undermine the ecological irrigating and fertilising services of the river', "" The Stiegler's Gorge Dam will therefore harm the wetland areas of the Selous and the wide variety of mammal and bird life that use it, including numerous waders, storks and herons as well as hippo and crocodiles"", ' Large, land-based mammals from elephants to lions also benefit from the presence of the water, particularly in the dry season', '  The Selous contains a number of endangered species, including white and black rhinoceros, lion, cheetah, Sanje crested Mangaby, wetland crane, lesser kestrel, Udzungwa red colobus monkey, Udzungwa forest partridge and rufous-winged partridge', ' Impact assessments indicate these could be affected by a future project', '  The dam will mean that downstream oxbow lakes are cut-off, become more saline from evaporation and will reduce in size', ' Cutting-off the lakes will also prevent the regeneration of fish stocks, particularly migratory fish', ' A study by Duvail et al', ' found that these negative impacts would occur even with a mitigating flood release of 2,500cms', ' For instance, this proposed water release would end at least two of the downstream lakes', '  Below the Selous Game Reserve is the Rufiji River Delta', ' This delta area, including Mafia Island, is protected by the highest international level of wetland protection, called the Ramsar Convention', "" The ecology of this area also depends on the river's seasonal nature"", "" The wet season's river-water surge counteracts the saline sea, maintaining a balance of salinity in the delta that underpins its current plant and animal mix"", ' This salinity balance supports the largest mangrove stand in East Africa', ""  The river's wet season surge, because it brings a large volume of fertile sediments, also supports an algal bloom in the ocean delta"", ' This bloom spawns a rapid annual explosion in plankton, which in-turn supports a rapid increase in fish', ' Migratory whale sharks and other animals also visit the delta area in the wet season to specifically take advantage of this bloom', ""  By altering the river's flow and withholding sediment, the dam will therefore damage the UNESCO Selous Site, downstream lakes and the Ramsar-protected delta area"", '  Social Impacts on Livelihoods  Impacts on the environment will have important socio-economic effects', "" The river's annual irrigating and fertilising flood creates a rich area of farmland below the park"", ' Typically, this supports recession agriculture that takes place in the dry season', "" Indeed, the Rufiji valley contains some of Tanzania's richest farmland, including extensive paddy fields"", ' People living in the valley also utilise lakes which are replenished by annual floods', ' These lakes provide a source for irrigation and a useful fish stock', "" Therefore, a change caused by the dam will negatively impact people's livelihoods downstream"", '  Another key impact is on fishing in the Rufiji River delta', "" This area is Tanzania's economically-richest fishery, centred on prawns"", "" Prawns and other fish numbers are underpinned by the river's wet season pulse"", "" Building the Stiegler's Gorge Dam will therefore harm fisheries around the Rufiji delta"", '  Another direct impact of the dam will be on tourism', ' This will be twofold', ' The main photo-tourist area of the Selous is the part of the reserve immediately below the gorge', ' The remainder of the park is for hunting tourism and will be negatively affected by construction', ' The building of the dam will bring a visual impact on this area because of the improved roads and large number of vehicles transporting materials to the dam', ' The hydropower plant will also require transmission lines', ' The Beho Beho Hills will visually shield the dam itself', ' Regardless, the short and long-term negative impacts on the wildlife of the park will undermine the reason for hunting and photo tourism', '  Particularly large Rufiji floods can significantly damage the communities living along the Rufiji River', ' This happened in 1968 for instance  when floods destroyed crops, houses and infrastructure', ' However, research demonstrates that many people living in the valley value such large floods, seeing them as a blessing in the longer term, not a plague', ' This is because of a perception of the floods as agriculturally important', ' Floodwater spreads more sediment creating rich agricultural conditions in for the following years', '  On the other hand, the project is expected to provide employment opportunities and invaluable experience to many Tanzanian engineers', '   See also    List of power stations in Tanzania

added it to the grounds for the Selous Game Reserve to be on the List of World Heritage in Danger, which grounds previously were only concerned with elephant poaching"", ""  In October 2018, after diplomatic negotiations between Tanzania's President Magufuli and Egypt's President Sisi, the government of Tanzania awarded the design and construction contract for this power project to the Egyptian company Arab Contractors together with the Egyptian manufacturing company El Sewedy Electric, at a budgeted cost of US$2"", '9 billion (TSh6', '558 trillion)', '  In February 2019, the government of Tanzania handed the construction site over to the contractors', ' Allowing several months to mobilize equipment, actual construction did not start until the summer of 2019', ' In April 2019, the Tanzanian government made an upfront payment of US$309', '645 million, representing approximately 15 percent total cost of construction', ""   Redesign and Construction  In 2018, a new design for Stiegler's Gorge Dam was unveiled"", ' A 131m high and 700m wide dam wall is under construction', ' The hydropower plant is planned to have an installed capacity of 2,115 megawatts', "" If completed

megawatts)"", ""  At 2,115 megawatts, the dam's contribution is more than the current peak demand of Tanzania"", "" The country's highest recorded power demand was 1051"", '27 megawatts in February 2017', ' Installed capacity has been reported to be between 1366', '60 megawatts and 1,602 megawatts', "" The Stiegler's Gorge Hydropower Project will therefore significantly increase the installed capacity on-grid in Tanzania, supporting power for industrialisation and electrification"", ""  A key rationale for new electricity generation are Tanzania's regular electricity crises"", "" The majority of Tanzania's power shortfalls occur in the dry season and in below-average rainfall years, this causes electricity shortages which are socially and economically damaging"", "" For instance, load shedding between 2014-2015 supposedly cost between 5-7% of Tanzania's GDP"", '  In preparation for the start of construction, Magufuli ordered Tanesco to prepare the site', ' Contracts were awarded to clear the construction area, prepare a road for large vehicles and provide power and water', ' The government also handed out rights to log the large reservoir area, which could bring in significant revenue', '  Arab Contractors, a public sector Egyptian firm would undertake the civil engineering works while El Sewedy Electric would install the electro-mechanical equipment including the turbines, generators and transmission lines', ' They signed contracts with the state-owned energy utility company TANESCO', "" The government has publicly stated that the dam will be financed by Tanzania's national budget, yet no funding package was announced and the World Bank and other financiers rejecting support for the dam"", ' Elsewedy have secured a loan of $500 million from the African Export-Import Bank, with guarantees from the United Bank for Africa and CRDB Bank, which they plan to repay through the project contract', ' After the allocation of a portion of the national

are contested"", ' When Odebrecht rewrote feasibility and design studies for the dam in 2013, they estimated that it would cost £3', '6 billion', ' The government used this figure in announcing the new design and feasibility study in 2018', ' However, Hartmann claims the underlying costs have changed, in the price of concrete and construction costs and in engineering services', ' Using contemporary dam cases, he suggests that, after excluding socio-environmental mitigation, the current cost estimation should be US$7', '57billion, rising to US$9', '8billion if a conservative amount of overrun is factored in', ""  Tanzania has not announced any funding agreements for the dam's construction"", "" Given the country's economy and tax base, there are doubts about whether the government has sufficient revenue to build the dam"", "" These are particularly relevant given specific outstanding debt issues with the electricity utility, who has signed the contracts for the Stiegler's Gorge Dam's construction"", ' This financial situation could delay or stop payments to the contractors which would harm or derail construction', '  Additional risks come from the choice of the two contractors', ' According to their public profiles, Dye claims that neither company has had experience of dam construction, and rather primarily builds commercial and residential buildings and transmission lines', ""   This lack of experience is notable given the size of Stiegler's Gorge Dam and the degree of hydrological flux in the Rufiji River"", "" There has not been a supervising, 'owner's engineer' appointed to ensure the quality of construction"", '  This contracting arrangement and the appointed companies entail important risks', ' Some of these are technical, concerning the construction of a project that stands up and functions (producing electricity) for the intended 50 years', "" This will depend on the accuracy and rigour of hydrology, sediment, climatic and hydropower studies and the engineers' ability to accurately implement complex designs"", ' There would also be a project management issue in undertaking infrastructure on this scale with recruitment estimated at 4000 plus personnel and a number of sub-contractors', ' Neither company appears to have experience of management on this scale', ' In its most extreme sense, this raises questions about dam safety, both in the construction phases and in the end product', ' A number of dam collapses such as the St', ' Francis Dam (USA)  or Malpasset Dam (France)  stemmed from poor studies and insufficient engineering standards', '  Another risk concerns environmental and social impacts', ' Given inexperience, the companies are unlikely to be familiar with mitigation codes of practice that could limit impacts, e', 'g', ' stopping dumping of soil in the river or in handling waste', ' There are also concerns over dam safety for workers, given the long history of accidents on dam projects before extra industry efforts in the 21st century', '  There are also significant concerns over poaching which has been a longstanding issue in the Selous Game Reserve', ' Poaching was the primary reason for placing the UNESCO World Heritage Selous Game Reserve on a list of endangered sites', ' The increased presence of people and steady flow of construction traffic, as well as logging camps, provides substantive opportunities for poaching and smuggling, especially if the companies do not have knowhow to enforce anti-poaching measures', "" Thus, the choice of the contractors magnify the pre-existing risks of undertaking the Stiegler's Gorge project"", ""  Risks to operation   There are a number of risks to the effective functioning of the Stiegler's Gorge Hydropower Project, if it is completed"", ' One of these comes from climate change', "" It is unclear if the total rainfall in Tanzania will increase or decrease, but studies suggest that precipitation's variability will increase"", "" This is important as it will affect hydropower production, decreasing the dam's electricity-generation reliability"", ' This is particularly important in the context of hydro-dependency', ' Tanzania gets the majority of its electricity from hydropower', "" A failure in these dams in the dry season is the key reason for the country's power failures, which happen frequently"", "" This vulnerability will increase if the Stiegler's Gorge Dam is completed"", "" If brought online today, a failure of the Stiegler's Gorge Hydropower Plant would reduce power production by 58"", '3%', '  The other risk comes from sedimentation', ' A report highlighted the vulnerability of the reservoir to rapid sedimentation', ' This is because of the existing sediment load in the Rufiji River and the high levels of erosion likely to occur around the reservoir', "" Higher sedimentation would decrease the reservoir's capacity to store water"", ' Such a reduction would reduce the reliability of the reservoir, as it would make it more directly dependent on precipitation', ""  Another fiscal danger comes from the ability of Tanzania's electricity utility, TANESCO, to sell the hydro-plant's energy"", "" Given Tanzania's current peak capacity of around 1"", '05GW and installed capacity of 1', ""5GW, there are persistent doubts about whether Tanzania can sell the dam's energy"", "" A number of reports cast doubt on the ability of the Tanzanian economy and electrification schemes to absorb the dam's demand"", ' Without such sales, the government will not easily recoup their investment', ' These reports also suggest that selling to the regional grid, to neighbouring countries through the Southern and Eastern African Power Pools, is unlikely to work given that both trading schemes are insufficiently institutionalised', ' There also appears to be a high level of distrust between countries when it comes to relying on others for power', ""  Negative Impacts  Academics and consultants have established the Stiegler's Gorge Dam's impacts"", "" They have argued that the significant level of environmental and social effects constitute an important trade-off in pursuing Stiegler's Gorge Dam"", ""  Environmental impacts  The key controversy of the proposed Stiegler's Gorge project concerns its environmental impacts"", ' An obvious concern is the location of the gorge in the middle of the Selous Game Reserve World Heritage Site', ' Firstly, the dam will flood over 2', ""2% of the reserve's total area, roughly equivalent to the size of Andorra, reducing its forest and riverine habitat"", '  Additionally, the dam project would be directly above the main area of biodiversity in the reserve', ' This consists of a large wetland, marsh and savanna area', ' The Rufiji River plays a central role in creating this environment', ' In the wet season, this river has a particularly strong hydrological surge', "" This force of water during the wet season changes the Rufiji River's path, creating a shifting pattern of oxbow lakes, dried river channels and wetland"", ' Collectively this creates a rich habitat contrasting with surrounding dry savannah', '  The Rufiji River has a strong seasonal variation', ' In the wet season, it floods a large area of land, irrigating the soil and spreading nutrient sediments', ' The wet season also refills and connects lakes in the Selous Reserve', '  Building a dam will change this seasonal river pattern and withhold sediment', ' It will create a more constant hydrological discharge, reducing the wet season flood', ' This will undermine the ecological irrigating and fertilising services of the river', "" The Stiegler's Gorge Dam will therefore harm the wetland areas of the Selous and the wide variety of mammal and bird life that use it, including numerous waders, storks and herons as well as hippo and crocodiles"", ' Large, land-based mammals from elephants to lions also benefit from the presence of the water, particularly in the dry season', '  The Selous contains a number of endangered species, including white and black rhinoceros, lion, cheetah, Sanje crested Mangaby, wetland crane, lesser kestrel, Udzungwa red colobus monkey, Udzungwa forest partridge and rufous-winged partridge', ' Impact assessments indicate these could be affected by a future project', '  The dam will mean that downstream oxbow lakes are cut-off, become more saline from evaporation and will reduce in size', ' Cutting-off the lakes will also prevent the regeneration of fish stocks, particularly migratory fish', ' A study by Duvail et al', ' found that these negative impacts would occur even with a mitigating flood release of 2,500cms', ' For instance, this proposed water release would end at least two of the downstream lakes', '  Below the Selous Game Reserve is the Rufiji River Delta', ' This delta area, including Mafia Island, is protected by the highest international level of wetland protection, called the Ramsar Convention', "" The ecology of this area also depends on the river's seasonal nature"", "" The wet season's river-water surge counteracts the saline sea, maintaining a balance of salinity in the delta that underpins its current plant and animal mix"", ' This salinity balance supports the largest mangrove stand in East Africa', ""  The river's wet season surge, because it brings a large volume of fertile sediments, also supports an algal bloom in the ocean delta"", ' This bloom spawns a rapid annual explosion in plankton, which in-turn supports a rapid increase in fish', ' Migratory whale sharks and other animals also visit the delta area in the wet season to specifically take advantage of this bloom', ""  By altering the river's flow and withholding sediment, the dam will therefore damage the UNESCO Selous Site, downstream lakes and the Ramsar-protected delta area"", '  Social Impacts on Livelihoods  Impacts on the environment will have important socio-economic effects', "" The river's annual irrigating and fertilising flood creates a rich area of farmland below the park"", ' Typically, this supports recession agriculture that takes place in the dry season', "" Indeed, the Rufiji valley contains some of Tanzania's richest farmland, including extensive paddy fields"", ' People living in the valley also utilise lakes which are replenished by annual floods', ' These lakes provide a source for irrigation and a useful fish stock', "" Therefore, a change caused by the dam will negatively impact people's livelihoods downstream"", '  Another key impact is on fishing in the Rufiji River delta', "" This area is Tanzania's economically-richest fishery, centred on prawns"", "" Prawns and other fish numbers are underpinned by the river's wet season pulse"", "" Building the Stiegler's Gorge Dam will therefore harm fisheries around the Rufiji delta"", '  Another direct impact of the dam will be on tourism', ' This will be twofold', ' The main photo-tourist area of the Selous is the part of the reserve immediately below the gorge', ' The remainder of the park is for hunting tourism and will be negatively affected by construction', ' The building of the dam will bring a visual impact on this area because of the improved roads and large number of vehicles transporting materials to the dam', ' The hydropower plant will also require transmission lines', ' The Beho Beho Hills will visually shield the dam itself', ' Regardless, the short and long-term negative impacts on the wildlife of the park will undermine the reason for hunting and photo tourism', '  Particularly large Rufiji floods can significantly damage the communities living along the Rufiji River', ' This happened in 1968 for instance  when floods destroyed crops, houses and infrastructure', ' However, research demonstrates that many people living in the valley value such large floods, seeing them as a blessing in the longer term, not a plague', ' This is because of a perception of the floods as agriculturally important', ' Floodwater spreads more sediment creating rich agricultural conditions in for the following years', '  On the other hand, the project is expected to provide employment opportunities and invaluable experience to many Tanzanian engineers', '   See also    List of power stations in Tanzania

The name is one of several toponyms sharing similar etymologies, ultimately meaning ""land of the blacks"" or similar meanings, in reference to the dark skin of the inhabitants', '   History    Pre-1498  The presence of microliths suggests that Zanzibar has been home to humans for at least 20,000 years, which was the beginning of the Later Stone Age', '  A Greco-Roman text between the 1st and 3rd centuries, the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, mentioned the island of Menuthias (), which is probably Unguja', ' Zanzibar, like the nearby coast, was settled by Bantu speakers at the outset of the first millennium', ' Archaeological finds at Fukuchani, on the northwest coast of Zanzibar, indicate a settled agricultural and fishing community from the 6th century at the latest', ' The considerable amount of daub found indicates timber buildings, and shell beads, bead grinders, and iron slag have been found at the site', ' There is evidence of limited engagement in long-distance trade: a small amount of imported pottery has been found, less than 1% of total pottery finds, mostly from the Gulf and dated to the 5th to 8th century', ' The similarity to contemporary sites such as Mkokotoni and Dar es Salaam indicates a unified group of communities that developed into the first center of coastal maritime culture', ' The coastal towns appear to have been engaged in Indian Ocean

materials allowing for flat roofs, while the majority of the population lived in single-story thatched houses similar to those from the 11th and 12th centuries', ' According to John Middleton and Mark Horton, the architectural style of these stone houses have no Arab or Persian elements, and should be viewed as an entirely indigenous development of local vernacular architecture', "" While much of Zanzibar Town's architecture was rebuilt during Omani rule, nearby sites elucidate the general development of Swahili, and Zanzibari, architecture before the 15th century"", '  From the 9th century, Swahili merchants on Zanzibar operated as brokers for long-distance traders from both the hinterland and Indian Ocean world', ' Persian, Indian, and Arab traders frequented Zanzibar to acquire East African goods like gold, ivory, and ambergris and then shipped them overseas to Asia', ' Similarly, caravan traders from the African Great Lakes and Zambezian Region came to the coast to trade for imported goods, especially Indian cloth', ' Before the Portuguese arrival, the southern towns of Unguja Ukuu and Kizimkazi and the northern town of Tumbatu were the dominant centers of exchange', ' Zanzibar was just one of the many autonomous city-states that dotted the East African littoral', ' These towns grew in wealth as the Swahili people served as intermediaries and facilitators to merchants and traders', ' This interaction between Central African and Indian Ocean cultures contributed in part to the evolution of the Swahili culture, which developed an Arabic-script literary tradition', ' Although a Bantu language, the Swahili language as a consequence today includes some borrowed elements, particularly loanwords from Arabic, though this was mostly a 19th-century phenomenon with the growth of Omani hegemony', ' Many foreign traders from Africa and Asia married into wealthy patrician families on Zanzibar', ' Particularly Asian men, who ""wintered"" on the coast

reason for placing the UNESCO World Heritage Selous Game Reserve on a list of endangered sites', ' The increased presence of people and steady flow of construction traffic, as well as logging camps, provides substantive opportunities for poaching and smuggling, especially if the companies do not have knowhow to enforce anti-poaching measures', "" Thus, the choice of the contractors magnify the pre-existing risks of undertaking the Stiegler's Gorge project"", ""  Risks to operation   There are a number of risks to the effective functioning of the Stiegler's Gorge Hydropower Project, if it is completed"", ' One of these comes from climate change', "" It is unclear if the total rainfall in Tanzania will increase or decrease, but studies suggest that precipitation's variability will increase"", "" This is important as it will affect hydropower production, decreasing the dam's electricity-generation reliability"", ' This is particularly important in the context of hydro-dependency', ' Tanzania gets the majority of its electricity from hydropower', "" A failure in these dams in the dry season is the key reason for the country's power failures, which happen frequently"", "" This vulnerability will increase if the Stiegler's Gorge Dam is completed"", "" If brought online today, a failure of the Stiegler's Gorge Hydropower Plant would reduce power production by 58"", '3%', '  The other risk comes from sedimentation', ' A report highlighted the vulnerability of the reservoir to rapid sedimentation', ' This is because of the existing sediment load in the Rufiji River and the high levels of erosion likely to occur around the reservoir', "" Higher sedimentation would decrease the reservoir's capacity to store water"", ' Such a reduction would reduce the reliability of the reservoir, as it would make it more directly dependent on precipitation', ""  Another fiscal danger comes from the ability of Tanzania's electricity utility, TANESCO, to sell the hydro-plant's energy"", "" Given Tanzania's current peak capacity of around 1"", '05GW and installed capacity of 1', ""5GW, there are persistent doubts about whether Tanzania can sell the dam's energy"", "" A number of reports cast doubt on the ability of the Tanzanian economy and electrification schemes to absorb the dam's demand"", ' Without such sales, the government will not easily recoup their investment', ' These reports also suggest that selling to the regional grid, to neighbouring countries through the Southern and Eastern African Power Pools, is unlikely to work given that both trading schemes are insufficiently institutionalised', ' There also appears to be a high level of distrust between countries when it comes to relying on others for power', ""  Negative Impacts  Academics and consultants have established the Stiegler's Gorge Dam's impacts"", "" They have argued that the significant level of environmental and social effects constitute an important trade-off in pursuing Stiegler's Gorge Dam"", ""  Environmental impacts  The key controversy of the proposed Stiegler's Gorge project concerns its environmental impacts"", ' An obvious concern is the location of the gorge in the middle of the Selous Game Reserve World Heritage Site', ' Firstly, the dam will flood over 2', ""2% of the reserve's total area, roughly equivalent to the size of Andorra, reducing its forest and riverine habitat"", '  Additionally, the dam project would be directly above the main area of biodiversity in the reserve', ' This consists of a large wetland, marsh and savanna area', ' The Rufiji River plays a central role in creating this environment', ' In the wet season, this river has a particularly strong hydrological surge', "" This force of water during the wet season changes the Rufiji River's path, creating a shifting pattern of oxbow lakes, dried river channels and wetland"", ' Collectively this creates a rich habitat contrasting with surrounding dry savannah', '  The Rufiji River has a strong seasonal variation', ' In the wet season, it floods a large area of land, irrigating the soil and spreading nutrient sediments', ' The wet season also refills and connects lakes in the Selous Reserve', '  Building a dam will change this seasonal river pattern and withhold sediment', ' It will create a more constant hydrological discharge, reducing the wet season flood', ' This will undermine the ecological irrigating and fertilising services of the river', "" The Stiegler's Gorge Dam will therefore harm the wetland areas of the Selous and the wide variety of mammal and bird life that use it, including numerous waders, storks and herons as well as hippo and crocodiles"", ' Large, land-based mammals from elephants to lions also benefit from the presence of the water, particularly in the dry season', '  The Selous contains a number of endangered species, including white and black rhinoceros, lion, cheetah, Sanje crested Mangaby, wetland crane, lesser kestrel, Udzungwa red colobus monkey, Udzungwa forest partridge and rufous-winged partridge', ' Impact assessments indicate these could be affected by a future project', '  The dam will mean that downstream oxbow lakes are cut-off, become more saline from evaporation and will reduce in size', ' Cutting-off the lakes will also prevent the regeneration of fish stocks, particularly migratory fish', ' A study by Duvail et al', ' found that these negative impacts would occur even with a mitigating flood release of 2,500cms', ' For instance, this proposed water release would end at least two of the downstream lakes', '  Below the Selous Game Reserve is the Rufiji River Delta', ' This delta area, including Mafia Island, is protected by the highest international level of wetland protection, called the Ramsar Convention', "" The ecology of this area also depends on the river's seasonal nature"", "" The wet season's river-water surge counteracts the saline sea, maintaining a balance of salinity in the delta that underpins its current plant and animal mix"", ' This salinity balance supports the largest mangrove stand in East Africa', ""  The river's wet season surge, because it brings a large volume of fertile sediments, also supports an algal bloom in the ocean delta"", ' This bloom spawns a rapid annual explosion in plankton, which in-turn supports a rapid increase in fish', ' Migratory whale sharks and other animals also visit the delta area in the wet season to specifically take advantage of this bloom', ""  By altering the river's flow and withholding sediment, the dam will therefore damage the UNESCO Selous Site, downstream lakes and the Ramsar-protected delta area"", '  Social Impacts on Livelihoods  Impacts on the environment will have important socio-economic effects', "" The river's annual irrigating and fertilising flood creates a rich area of farmland below the park"", ' Typically, this supports recession agriculture that takes place in the dry season', "" Indeed, the Rufiji valley contains some of Tanzania's richest farmland, including extensive paddy fields"", ' People living in the valley also utilise lakes which are replenished by annual floods', ' These lakes provide a source for irrigation and a useful fish stock', "" Therefore, a change caused by the dam will negatively impact people's livelihoods downstream"", '  Another key impact is on fishing in the Rufiji River delta', "" This area is Tanzania's economically-richest fishery, centred on prawns"", "" Prawns and other fish numbers are underpinned by the river's wet season pulse"", "" Building the Stiegler's Gorge Dam will therefore harm fisheries around the Rufiji delta"", '  Another direct impact of the dam will be on tourism', ' This will be twofold', ' The main photo-tourist area of the Selous is the part of the reserve immediately below the gorge', ' The remainder of the park is for hunting tourism and will be negatively affected by construction', ' The building of the dam will bring a visual impact on this area because of the improved roads and large number of vehicles transporting materials to the dam', ' The hydropower plant will also require transmission lines', ' The Beho Beho Hills will visually shield the dam itself', ' Regardless, the short and long-term negative impacts on the wildlife of the park will undermine the reason for hunting and photo tourism', '  Particularly large Rufiji floods can significantly damage the communities living along the Rufiji River', ' This happened in 1968 for instance  when floods destroyed crops, houses and infrastructure', ' However, research demonstrates that many people living in the valley value such large floods, seeing them as a blessing in the longer term, not a plague', ' This is because of a perception of the floods as agriculturally important', ' Floodwater spreads more sediment creating rich agricultural conditions in for the following years', '  On the other hand, the project is expected to provide employment opportunities and invaluable experience to many Tanzanian engineers', '   See also    List of power stations in Tanzania
