made by hominins breaking open the bones for marrow, using tools to strip the meat, or by carnivores having gnawed the bones', ' Since several kinds of marks are present together, some archaeologists including Lewis Binford think that hominins scavenged the meat or marrow left over from carnivore kills', ' Others like Henry Bunn believe the hominins hunted and killed these animals, and carnivores later chewed the bones', ' This issue is still debated today, but archaeologist Pat Shipman provided evidence that scavenging was probably the more common practice; she published that the majority of carnivore teeth marks came before the cut marks', ' Another finding by Shipman at FLK-Zinj is that many of the wildebeest bones found there are over-represented by adult and male bones; and this may indicate that hominins were systematically hunting these animals as well as scavenging them', ' The issue of hunting versus gathering at Olduvai Gorge is still a controversial one', '  Hominid fossils

broadcasts also were an integral part of the genocide, which further fueled the genocide by encouraging Hutu civilians to kill their Tutsi neighbours, labeled as ""cockroaches"" in need of extermination', ' Despite its colossal scale, particularly within such a short period of time, the genocide was carried out almost entirely by hand, usually with the utilization of machetes and clubs', ' Various atrocities committed include the rape of thousands of Tutsi women, as well as the dismemberment and disfigurement of victims', ' Frequently the killers were people the victims knew personally—neighbors, workmates, former friends, sometimes even relatives through marriage', ' At least 500,000 Tutsis were killed, and approximately 2 million refugees (mostly Hutus) left for refugee

serve up to 1', '5 million passengers per year', ""  Zanzibar's marine ecosystem is an important part of the economy for fishing and algaculture and contains important marine ecosystems that act as fish nurseries for Indian Ocean fish populations"", ' Moreover, the land ecosystem is the home of the endemic Zanzibar red colobus, the Zanzibar servaline genet, and the extinct or rare Zanzibar leopard', ' Pressure from the tourist industry and fishing as well as larger threats such as sea level rise caused by climate change are creating increasing environmental concerns throughout the region', '   Etymology  The word Zanzibar came from Arabic zanjibār ( ), which is in turn from Persian zangbâr ( ), a compound of Zang ( , ""black"") + bâr ( , ""coast""), cf', ' the Sea of Zanj', ' The name is one of several toponyms sharing similar etymologies, ultimately meaning ""land of the blacks"" or similar meanings, in reference to the dark skin of the inhabitants', '   History    Pre-1498  The presence of microliths suggests that Zanzibar has been home to humans for at least 20,000 years, which was the beginning of the Later Stone Age', '  A Greco-Roman text between the 1st and 3rd centuries, the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, mentioned the island of Menuthias (), which is probably Unguja', ' Zanzibar, like the nearby coast, was settled by Bantu speakers at the outset of the first millennium', ' Archaeological finds at Fukuchani, on the northwest coast of Zanzibar, indicate a settled agricultural and fishing community from the 6th century at the latest', ' The considerable amount of daub found indicates timber buildings, and shell beads, bead grinders, and iron slag have been found at the site', ' There is evidence of limited engagement in long-distance trade: a small amount of imported pottery has been found, less than 1% of total pottery finds, mostly from the Gulf and dated to the 5th to 8th century', ' The similarity to contemporary sites such as Mkokotoni and Dar es Salaam indicates a unified group of communities that developed into the first center of coastal maritime culture', ' The coastal towns appear to have been engaged in Indian Ocean and inland African trade at this early period', ' Trade rapidly increased in importance and quantity beginning in the mid-8th century and by the close of the 10th century Zanzibar was one of the

originally built with timber (circa 1050) and later in mud with coral walls (circa 1150)', ' The houses were continually rebuilt with more permanent materials', ' By the 13th century, houses were built with stone, and bonded with mud, and the 14th century saw the use of lime to bond stone', ' Only the wealthier patricians would have had stone and lime built houses, the strength of the materials allowing for flat roofs, while the majority of the population lived in single-story thatched houses similar to those from the 11th and 12th centuries', ' According to John Middleton and Mark Horton, the architectural style of these stone houses have no Arab or Persian elements, and should be viewed as an entirely indigenous development of local vernacular architecture', "" While much of Zanzibar Town's architecture was rebuilt during Omani rule, nearby sites elucidate the general development of Swahili, and Zanzibari, architecture before the 15th century"", '  From the 9th century, Swahili merchants on Zanzibar operated as brokers for long-distance traders from both the hinterland and Indian Ocean world', ' Persian, Indian, and Arab traders frequented Zanzibar to acquire East African goods like gold, ivory, and ambergris and then shipped them overseas to Asia', ' Similarly, caravan traders from the African Great Lakes and Zambezian Region came to the coast to trade for imported goods, especially Indian cloth', ' Before the Portuguese arrival, the southern towns of Unguja Ukuu and Kizimkazi and the northern town of Tumbatu were the dominant centers of exchange', ' Zanzibar was just one of the many autonomous city-states that dotted the East African littoral', ' These towns grew in wealth as the Swahili people served as intermediaries and facilitators to merchants and traders', ' This interaction between Central African and Indian Ocean cultures contributed in part to the evolution of the Swahili culture, which developed an Arabic-script literary tradition', ' Although a Bantu language, the Swahili language as a consequence today includes some borrowed elements, particularly loanwords from Arabic, though this was mostly a 19th-century phenomenon with the growth of Omani hegemony', ' Many foreign traders from Africa and Asia married into wealthy patrician families on Zanzibar', ' Particularly Asian men, who ""wintered"" on the coast for up to six months because of the prevailing monsoon wind patterns, married East African women', ' Since most Asian traders were Muslim, their children inherited their paternal ethnic identity,

The ethnic categorization of the two was an imposed and an arbitrary construct based more on physical characteristics than ethnic background', ' However, the social differences between the Hutu and the Tusi have traditionally allowed the Tutsi, with a strong pastoralist tradition, to gain social, economic, and political ascendancy over the Hutu, who were primarily agriculturalists', ' The

carrying then-President Juvenal Habyarimana, and Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi was shot down, killing everyone on board', ' The Hutu held the RPF accountable and immediately began the genocide, targeted at both Tutsis and Hutu moderates', '  Most of the killing during the Rwandan genocide was carried out by the radical Hutu groups known as the Interahamwe and the Impuzamugambi', ' Radio broadcasts also were an integral part of the genocide, which further fueled the genocide by encouraging Hutu civilians to kill their Tutsi neighbours, labeled as ""cockroaches"" in need of extermination', ' Despite its colossal scale, particularly within such a short period of time, the genocide was carried out almost entirely by hand, usually with the utilization of machetes and clubs', ' Various atrocities committed include the rape of thousands of Tutsi women, as well as the dismemberment and disfigurement of victims', ' Frequently the killers were people the victims knew personally—neighbors, workmates, former friends, sometimes even relatives through marriage', ' At least 500,000 Tutsis were killed, and approximately 2 million refugees (mostly Hutus) left for refugee

found in Beds II, III, and IV, with small tools made mostly from chert rather than quartzite', '  These tools are mostly spheroids and sub-spheroids, followed by choppers', '  Besides the chert quarry in Bed II, the Leakeys were able to identify the other source locations of the principal rocks used to make the stone tools', '  The most common material was quartzite, which originated from the Naibor Soit Inselberg just north of the gorges', '  The phonolite originated from the Engelosen volcano 5\xa0km to the north', '  The gneiss came from the Kelogi inselborg 9\xa0km to the southwest', '  The first species found by the Leakeys, Zinjanthropus boisei or Australopithecus boisei (renamed and still debated as Paranthropus boisei), featured a sagittal crest and large molars', ' These attributes suggested the species engaged in heavy chewing, indicating a diet of tough plant material, including tubers, nuts, and seeds—and possibly large quantities of grasses and sedges', ""  Conversely, the Leakeys' 1960s finds presented different characteristics"", ' The skull lacked a sagittal crest and the braincase was much more rounded, suggesting it was not australopithecine', ' The larger braincase suggested a larger brain capacity than that of Australopithecus boisei', ' These important differences indicated a different species, which eventually was named Homo habilis', ' Its larger brain capacity and decreased teeth size pointed to Homo as the probable toolmaker', '  The oldest tools at Olduvai, found at the lowest layer and classified as Oldowan, consist of pebbles chipped on one edge', ' Above this layer, and later in time, are the true hand-axe industries, the Chellean and the Acheulean', ' Higher still (and later still) are located Levallois artifacts, and finally the Stillbay implements', ' Oldowan tools in general are called ""pebble tools"" because the blanks chosen by the stone knapper already resembled, in pebble form, the final product', '<ref>Napier, John', ' 1960', ' ""Fossil Hand Bones from Olduvai Gorge', '"" in Nature"", December 17th edition', '</ref> Mary Leakey classified the Oldowan tools according to usage; she developed Oldowan A, B, and C categories, linking them to Modes 1, 2, and 3 assemblages classified according to mode of manufacture', ' Her work remains a foundation for assessing local, regional, and continental changes in stone tool-making during the early Pleistocene, and aids in assessing which hominins were responsible for the several changes in stone tool technology over time', '  It is not known for sure which hominin species was first to create Oldowan tools', ' The emergence of tool culture has also been associated with the pre-Homo species Australopithecus garhi, and its flourishing is associated with the early species Homo habilis and Homo ergaster', ' Beginning 1', '7 million years ago, early Homo erectus apparently inherited Oldowan technology and refined it into the Acheulean industry', ' ', '  Oldowan tools occur in Beds I–IV at Olduvai Gorge', ' Bed I, dated 1', '85 to 1', '7 mya, contains Oldowan tools and fossils of Paranthropus boisei and Homo habilis, as does Bed II,

significant change took place between Beds I and II at about 1', '5 mya', ' Flake size increased, the length of bifacial edges (as opposed to single-face edges) occurred more frequently and their length increased, and signs of battering on other artifacts increased', ' Some likely implications of these factors, among others, are that after this pivotal time hominins used tools more frequently, became better at making tools, and  transported tools more often', '  Hunters or scavengers? thumb|250px|right|Worked lithic flake Though substantial evidence of hunting and scavenging has been discovered at Olduvai Gorge, it is believed by archaeologists that hominins inhabiting the area between 1', '9 and 1', '7 million years ago spent the majority of their time gathering wild plant foods, such as berries, tubers and roots', ' The earliest hominins most likely did not rely on meat for the bulk of their nutrition', ' Speculation about the amount of meat in their diets is inferred from comparative studies with a close relative of early hominins: the modern chimpanzee', "" The chimpanzee's diet in the wild consists of only about five percent as meat"", ' And the diets of modern hunter-gatherers do not include a large amount of meat', "" That is, most of the calories in both groups' diets came from plant sources"", ' Thus, it can be assumed that early hominins had similar diet proportions, (see the middle-range theory or bridging arguments—bridging arguments are used by archaeologists to explain past behaviors, and they include an underlying assumption of uniformitarianism', ')  Much of the information about early hominins comes from tools and debris piles of lithic flakes from such sites as FLK-Zinjanthropus in Olduvai Gorge', ' Early hominins selected specific types of rocks that would break in a predictable manner when ""worked"", and carried these rocks from deposits several kilometres away', ' Archaeologists such as Fiona Marshall fitted rock fragments back together like a puzzle', ' She states in her article ""Life in Olduvai Gorge"" that early hominins, ""knew the right angle to hit the cobble, or core, in order to successfully produce sharp-edged flakes ', '', '', '""', ' She noted that selected flakes then were used to cut meat from animal carcasses, and shaped cobbles (called choppers) were used to extract marrow and to chop tough  plant material', '  Bone fragments of birds, fish, amphibians, and large mammals were found at the FLK-Zinj site, many of which were scarred with marks', ' These likely were made by hominins breaking open the bones for marrow, using tools to strip the meat, or by carnivores having gnawed the bones', ' Since several kinds of marks are present together, some archaeologists including Lewis Binford think that hominins scavenged the meat or marrow left over from carnivore kills', ' Others like Henry Bunn believe the hominins hunted and killed these animals, and carnivores later chewed the bones', ' This issue is still debated today, but archaeologist Pat Shipman provided evidence that scavenging was probably the more common practice; she published that the majority of carnivore teeth marks came before the cut marks', ' Another finding by Shipman at FLK-Zinj is that many of the wildebeest bones found there are over-represented by adult and male bones; and this may indicate that hominins were systematically hunting these animals as well as scavenging them', ' The issue of hunting versus gathering at Olduvai Gorge is still a controversial one', '  Hominid fossils

of the three divisions of the Chagga states by the British rule in 1946 with the recognition of Chief M', 'H', ' Abdiel Shangali of Machame as the divisional chief, could have been none other than tracing back the Chagga politics to its old pre-German colonial rule where the then King of Machame extended his influence', ' The Hai division comprised Chagga states from Siha in the Western-end of Chagga to river Nanga, forming a rough boundary within Vunjo to the further Eastern Chagga states of Rombo', 'Stahl, Kathleen Mary (1964)', ' History of the Chagga People of Kilimanjaro', ' Mouton Publication: London', ' By 1920s however, due to successive political instability and confusion in the obscure state of Siha, supposedly instigated by the Machame political aristocrats, Chief Abdiel Shangali of Machame re-claimed Siha by implying that ""the efforts to make it independent from Machame have failed""', "" Since the 1880s to 1946, Machame had lost 'for good' its influence over all the Chagga states from Weruweru river Eastwards"", ' It was therefore the formation of the Hai division in 1946 that brought back the influence of the Chief of Machame to the Eastern Chagga states beyond Weruweru river', ' However, the redefinition of Chagga politics revived by the formation of divisions by the British rule would soon escalate to set the Chagga politics into the edge, the saga of which is discussed later in this article', '  After Tanganyika independence in 1961, the provinces were abolished and local authorities redefined', ' The Hai division became Hai district which mainly included the Kilimanjaro area West of Weruweru river, hence, roughly comprising the old Chagga states once identified as the confederation under the ruler of Machame', ' In 2005, Siha became a new constituency separate from the Hai district', ' Today Machame-Masama form the Hai constituency separated by the Kikafu river, with Machame to its East and Masama to the West', "" Out of 10 wards that comprise the Hai constituency, 6 form part of Machame and 4 are Masama's"", ' This division though, seems again to repeat the history of Machame chiefdom in the late 1880s and 1890s', ' Over and

1990s and later, the flumes are still used and maintained for agricultural irrigation', '  We will observe in this article that, although there is a particular location identified as Machame, due to historical reasons, the study will inevitably present Machame and Masama as a composite narrative and classical discourse as this seems to be the case ever since before Masama got that identity

history has a long, interesting and yet complex background as noted by the historian M', 'K', ' Stahl', ' It portrays an African heritage and socio-political system which preceded the colonial rule depicting somehow advanced African political systems even during the times of primitive African social lifestyle', ' Machame chiefdom for example, by the mid-1800s had expanded to rule all areas to the western part of Chagga', ' As narrated to Rev', ' Johannine Rebmann while in Kilema, the Chief of Machame had a command in all of the Chagga except Rombo', 'Herrmann, K', ' (1997) Rebmann, Johannes: Tagebuch des Missionars, vom 14', ' Februar 1848-16', ' Februar 1849', ' However, according to M', 'K', ' Stahl, the actual location identified by Machame name was but a small strip of land with total control and influence extending between the two major rivers of Kilimanjaro, i', 'e', ' Kikafu and Weruweru', ' The development therefore of what was later to be known as the greater Machame is of interest in this article including the study on different etymologies and the traditions which are expected to benefit those who study African history', '   Migration to the mountain  The Machame  and Meru people are said to have migrated from the Usambara mountains in Tanga Region 400 years ago to Kilimanjaro Region', ' However, it is not easy to know today when did the modern Chagga started to migrate to the Mountain', "" Many narrations exist, legendary or true, since many African tribes didn't have the tradition of writing down the events in their lifetimes"", ' However, following Machame narrations, who are among the few Chagga families to recall the encounter with the earlier inhabitants on the mountain, it seems that the migration of the later people who came to be called the Chagga, started about 600 years ago', ' The Machame elders recall the encounter of their ancestors with the earlier settlers of the mountain whom they referred to as the Koningo (wataremba), meaning, the pigmies (or mbilikimo in Swahili)', '  Since very few other Chagga clans on the mountain can recall the existence of such people on the mountain, this can mean that the machame ancestors might have been one of the earliest immigrants of the later Chaggas on the mountain', ' They describe the koningo as the short people with big heads carrying hones wherever they went', ' The horns were used for blowing in case one fell down for another one to come and lift him/her up', ' They also used hones to notify others of an important issue that needed caution or assembling', ' They were skilled in hunting and are described as very innocent people', ' However, these were replaced by the now migrating folks although till today the remains of these people can be traced on some parts of the mountain which indicates that some were integrated into the incoming migrants probably through marriage', ' It was historical unfortunate that the later visitors to the mountain thought the Chagga to be one tribe', ' Since they were referred to as the Chagga by the Swahili from the coast, other visitors to the mountain such as missionaries and explorers thought that the mountain was dwelt by one tribe called the Chagga', ' However, this was not the case', '   The people who migrated to the mountain came from completely diverse backgrounds', ' There were those who came from the Usambara mountains, who migrated to the west and some parts of the central area of the mountain, those who migrated from the Kamba origin, especially those who settled to the east of the mountain together with the Taita, and those who had the maasai and waarush background who initially settled in the lower plains of the mountain but slowly some moved up to settle in upper parts of the mountain', ' Different reasons contributed to the migration of these different groups to the mountain, some of them are: Fleeing from drought, famine or epidemics where they had lived', ' A search for a peaceful environment, fleeing from wars and insecurity as they saw the mountainous place to be safer than where they had been', ' A search for a more prosperous land, since the mountainous soil was very fertile with many streams of water and the weather was very promising for agricultural activities', ' Travellers and those who went to the mountain for various activities such as trade, but decided to remain there', '  All these reflect different backgrounds', ' Different backgrounds then mean different languages, cultures, skills and traditions although the fact that majority were of the Bantu origin, it accounted for the similarity of languages, cultures and traditions', ' Different groups came with different skills to the mountain like hunting, forging weapons, war skills, pot making, furrow making, making and collecting honey, etc', ' These various groups intermingled to some degree and their existence on the mountain is what formed what came to be known as Chagga complex', ' All these contributed to the high skills and the brightness that the Chagga people portrayed', '  Etymology of the land At this stage we will look at three important words in the Chagga history, chagga, kilimanjaro and moshi', ' Historian Mary K', ' Stahl and explorer Charles NewNew, Charles (1873)', ' Life, Wanderings and Labours in Eastern Africa', ' Royal Geographical Society: London', ' give their opinions as to the meanings of the first two words', ' The origin of the word Chagga (dschagga or jagga) is not very clear today', ' K', ' Stahl gives differing opinions as to its origin although one of her opinions seem to concur with Charles new\'s meaning of ""getting lost"" or ""to give farewell to someone who is about to take a journey that you are not sure if they will be back (as they may get lost forever)""', "" In earlier Swahili language this would have been called 'kuchaaga' meaning to say bye"", "" Today's Swahili is 'kuaga'"", "" Why the land was attached with the word 'to get lost'? This is where the stories begin"", ' It is claimed that the first coastal trade people to get into the land got lost due to the thick forests', ' As hypothesized by Stahl, it took them days to get their original route again and they thought that their getting lost was mysterious', ' When they went back to the coast they spread this news and the land was called Chaga (or Chagga) as a sign of getting lost', '  Another explanation of the origin of the word, which also missionary Charles New mentioned as he quoted rev', ' Johannine Rebmann, is that the word came out of a terrible event that befell on people', ' The years of the event are not known to us but it was a time when a powerful chief of Machame, Rengua, was ruling and at that time caravans from the coast had already started to get there to trade on ivory with the natives', ' Being constantly instigated by the Swahili people that what is on top of the mountain has to do with silver which promises much richness to his kingdom, Chief Rengua sent a large band of emissary to get as much silver as possible down to him', ' A caravan trader from the coast Bwana Heri who accompanied rev', ' Rebmann to the mountain told him that he actually saw one of the survivors of the tragedy who had become disabled due to freezing temperature as they went up the mountain', ' The rest of the envoy perished on the way', ' The story that survived was that on the mountain there is a spirit that will destroy anyone who would try to get close to it, and the Swahili who were at the court of Rengua, seeing the disaster that had befallen those who went up, spread news to the coast that anyone trying to get higher on the mountain will get lost as the mountain has the dreadful spirit', '  The land was called chaaga as commemoration of the tragedy', ' This story apart from being backed up by the people who were close to the event as recorded in the history books, also connects very well with stories that circulated in the coast when rev', ' Rebmann arrived there on his mission to the Chagga', ' On learning that Rebmann wanted to go to the land of Chagga, the Swahili sultan of Mombasa who was an Arab, warned him that the land is dangerous as there is a spirit on the mountain that destroys people and he might get lost when he tries to do so', "" He mentioned to Rebmann that the name of the spirit (as known in the coast) was 'ndscharo' and hence the mountain was called mountain of ndscharo (i"", 'e', ' kilimandscharo)', "" He could nearly stop Rebmann from going to the land of Chagga if it were not for Rebmann's persistence to go there"", "" However, it shows that earlier the people of Chagga were known as 'wakirima', i"", 'e', ' people of the mountain (kirima was an old Swahili word for a hill)', ' Where they lived was known as the land of Chagga (i', 'e', ' land of getting lost) although later on the name was attached to the people themselves', ""  Of importance however, is the way the name 'Moshi' became prominent among the people of the mountain and by the early 1900s it could almost be used synonymously with the name of the Chagga land"", ' Moshi was one of the chiefdoms in Chagga ruled by Rindi (1860–1890)', ' Before that time the name scarcely surfaced in history although it seemed to be a recognisable location of some prominence', ' For example, in 1849, Rev', ' Rebmann mentions a young man who had come all the way from Moshi to trade honey and milk with his men when they camped at Machame', ' He also records in his diary of trouble in Kirua caused by one Kirumi who was supported by allies from Moshi (where his mother came from) to overthrow his father Marengo', ' This happened when Rev', ' Rebmann and his men were still in Kilema', ' These instances are the first appearances of Moshi in historical records, and just after a decade, Von der Decken records Moshi as a recognisable chiefdom although still not attained some autonomy from Machame as he observed earlier', 'Theil, E', ', Band, Z', "" (1871) Baron Carl Claus von der Decken's Reisen in Ost-Afrika in den Jahren 1862 bis 1865"", ""  During Decken's visit to Chagga a young chief Rindi was ruling in Moshi"", ' With much witticism and intrigue, and under the regency of his mother Mamchaki,Hollis, C', ', Von der Decken', ' Tanganyika Notes Records, 1958', ' Rindi established his chiefdom from a place known as tsudunyi in early 1860 and using the location of his chiefdom as a strategic advantage, directed many caravan traders to the mountain into his land', ' With much ambitions to power he even sabotaged caravans which did not show intention to pass through his chiefdom and those explorers who asked for guidance to other chiefdoms he conspired with his men who misguided them and got them lost or back to his chiefdom', ' However, there are indications that during his early days in power he acquired support from Machame to cleverly establish his presence in the east', ' By the early 1870s he could declare to foreigners that the whole of Chagga was divided into two major powers; Machame under Ndesserua being the greatest in the West and himself an important chief in the east', ' He substantiated his claim by providing a letter to Charles New that granted him safe passage to every chiefdom he could visit to the east of Chagga', '  Having acquired autonomy from Machame through allied raids to the east of Chagga and as far as Usambara, with extraordinary diplomatic schemes, by 1870 he could direct to his capital, Moshi, most missionaries and explorers who started to flock into the Chagga', ' This seemingly well calculated generosity made his chiefdom extremely popular to the coast and to the Europeans', ' Apart from all these well learned visitors to his chiefdom, it was an explorer Sir Henry H', 'H', ' JohnstonJohnston, Sir H', 'H', ' (1886)', ' Kilimanjaro Expedition', ' London', ' in 1884 who attempted to work on the etymology of the land', "" He investigated the meaning of the word 'Moshi' and the answers he got from traditional elders and others was just the variant of its pronunciations, like 'mushi', or 'muschi', 'moschi' etc"", 'etc', ' One thing he was assured was that the name did not relate to the Swahili word for smoke, i', 'e', ' moshi, as Chagga had a different word for that', "" He therefore had to conclude that the word 'probably comes from one of the kichagga terms or word'"", "" It's amazing how at that time couldn't the people of Moshi know the origin of the word for their chiefdom?

made by hominins breaking open the bones for marrow, using tools to strip the meat, or by carnivores having gnawed the bones', ' Since several kinds of marks are present together, some archaeologists including Lewis Binford think that hominins scavenged the meat or marrow left over from carnivore kills', ' Others like Henry Bunn believe the hominins hunted and killed these animals, and carnivores later chewed the bones', ' This issue is still debated today, but archaeologist Pat Shipman provided evidence that scavenging was probably the more common practice; she published that the majority of carnivore teeth marks came before the cut marks', ' Another finding by Shipman at FLK-Zinj is that many of the wildebeest bones found there are over-represented by adult and male bones; and this may indicate that hominins were systematically hunting these animals as well as scavenging them', ' The issue of hunting versus gathering at Olduvai Gorge is still a controversial one', '  Hominid fossils

member states; and  common customs procedures', '  Different rates are applied for raw materials (0%), intermediate products (10%) and finished goods (25%), the latter percentage is fixed as the maximum', ' This represents a significance decrease from what was previously the maximum in Kenya (35%), Tanzania (40%) and Uganda (15%)', ' However, this customs union is not yet fully implemented, because there is a significant list of exclusions to the Common External Tariff and tariff-free movement of goods and services', "" Technical work is also needed to harmonise and modernise the customs procedures in the EAC's major ports of entry"", ""  The expected revenue benefits are understood to be minimal by many analysts, based on comparative-static simulation exercises demonstrating the one-off impacts of the immediate introduction of the CU's full tariff package"", ' The findings suggest an increase in intraregional trade that is largely the result of trade diversion, not trade creation, with some aggregate welfare benefits in Kenya and Tanzania but welfare losses in Uganda', "" From a trade-integration perspective, the EAC may not be the best chosen unit, because the current trade between the three countries is small compared to their external trade, and the EAC's  citizens do not represent a large market in global terms, given the very low average incomes"", '  Emerging business trends Business leaders are far more positive than economists about the benefits of EAC integration, its customs union as a step in the process, as well as the wider integration under COMESA', ' The larger economic players perceive long-term benefits in a progressively expanding regional market', ' Pattern of regional development are already emerging, including:  Kenyan firms have successfully aligned to the lower protection afforded by the EAC CET and fears that firms would not adjust to a 25% maximum CET, or would relocate to Tanzania or Uganda have not been realised', '  An intraregional division of labour is developing that results in basic import-processing relocating to the coast to supply the hinterland', ' The final stages of import-processing (especially those bulky finished goods that involve high transportation costs) and natural-resource based activities, are moving up-country and up-region, either within value chains of large companies or different segments located by firms in different countries', '  Trade in goods and services has already increased as service provision to Kenyans and Tanzanians is already important for Uganda (in education and

overwhelmingly rural poor will be slight, with the significant exception of agro-industrial firms with out-grower schemes or that otherwise contribute to the co-ordination of smallholder production and trade"", '  It is informal trade across borders that is most often important to rural livelihoods and a customs union is unlikely to significantly impact the barriers that this faces and taxes are still being fixed separately by countries', ' However, the introduction of one-stop border posts being introduced and the reduction in tariff barriers are coming down progressively', '  The establishment of a common market will create both winners (numerous food producers and consumers on both sides of all borders) and losers (smugglers and the customs, police and local government officers who currently benefit from bribery at and around the borders) in the border areas', "" More substantial impact could be attained by a new generation of investments in world-market production

length increased, and signs of battering on other artifacts increased', ' Some likely implications of these factors, among others, are that after this pivotal time hominins used tools more frequently, became better at making tools, and  transported tools more often', '  Hunters or scavengers? thumb|250px|right|Worked lithic flake Though substantial evidence of hunting and scavenging has been discovered at Olduvai Gorge, it is believed by archaeologists that hominins inhabiting the area between 1', '9 and 1', '7 million years ago spent the majority of their time gathering wild plant foods, such as berries, tubers and roots', ' The earliest hominins most likely did not rely on meat for the bulk of their nutrition', ' Speculation about the amount of meat in their diets is inferred from comparative studies with a close relative of early hominins: the modern chimpanzee', "" The chimpanzee's diet in the wild consists of only about five percent as meat"", ' And the diets of modern hunter-gatherers do not include a large amount of meat', "" That is, most of the calories in both groups' diets came from plant sources"", ' Thus, it can be assumed that early hominins had similar diet proportions, (see the middle-range theory or bridging arguments—bridging arguments are used by archaeologists to explain past behaviors, and they include an underlying assumption of uniformitarianism', ')  Much of the information about early hominins comes from tools and debris piles of lithic flakes from such sites as FLK-Zinjanthropus in Olduvai Gorge', ' Early hominins selected specific types of rocks that would break in a predictable manner when ""worked"", and carried these rocks from deposits several kilometres away', ' Archaeologists such as Fiona Marshall fitted rock fragments back together like a puzzle', ' She states in her article ""Life in Olduvai Gorge"" that early hominins, ""knew the right angle to hit the cobble, or core, in order to successfully produce sharp-edged flakes ', '', '', '""', ' She noted that selected flakes then were used to cut meat from animal carcasses, and shaped cobbles (called choppers) were used to extract marrow and to chop tough  plant material', '  Bone fragments of birds, fish, amphibians, and large mammals were found at the FLK-Zinj site, many of which were scarred with marks', ' These likely were made by hominins breaking open the bones for marrow, using tools to strip the meat, or by carnivores having gnawed the bones', ' Since several kinds of marks are present together, some archaeologists

led to a highly confined influence constrained between Machame itself and a neighbouring ward, Masama, where a frail sultan of Machame seemed to alternate in abode', ' Although by 1889 she was still estimated to comprise almost 20% of all the population of the Chagga, towards the end of the 19th Century Machame distinctly became a lowly chieftaincy still with claims of influence over Masama', '

between 1860-1870', ' The presentation will alternate between the Machame as a confederation of Chagga states West of river Weruweru (by the 1860s), Machame as narrowly defining the Machame-Masama state by the end of the 1880s, and Machame as a location that bears that name (i', 'e', ' pre-1800 identity)', '   Economy and agricultural practices  The majority of residents of Machame, like in many other rural areas of Tanzania, earn a living through agriculture', ' The year-round temperate climate and fairly high humidity allow cultivation of a huge variety of crops', ' Since the colonial period, coffee has been an important cash crop for export; however, its prominence has decreased in recent decades', ' As noted by Mbonile, et al', ', declining prices for exports have influenced farmers to replace coffee with annual crops like tomatoes, of which the surplus may be sold and consumed regionally', ' The overall land-use pattern in Machame (and surrounding foothill areas of Mt', ' Kilimanjaro) have changed broadly over the past 120 years—even more dramatically in the post-independence period', ' Specifically, increasing agricultural planting in the bottom three of the five climatic zones of Kilimanjaro has reduced native vegetation', ' Agriculture in Machame fits generally into two modes: home gardens consisting of multipurpose trees interspersed with food crops near houses, and the ""shamba"" lands, or small fields, where food crops like maize, finger millet, and beans are grown', 'LUCID Working Paper #25, M', 'J', ' Mbonile, S', 'B', ' Misana, C', ' Sokoni', '

' There are also several formal markets—e', 'g', ', Kalali near the main road, and Bwani near Uraa—that are organized and regulated by local government entities', ' Each market typically has one or two designated market days each week', ' Machame is also dotted with other small businesses such as mills for grain and presses for sunflower oil', '  With the growing use of the Machame Route through Kilimanjaro National Park, a few businesses catering to tourists have emerged', ' Many are informal, small-scale vendors near the Machame Gate', ' Recently, the Protea hotel chain based in South Africa opened the Protea Hotel Aisha Machame just along the main north-south road', 'Link for Aishi Machame hotel at Protea corporate web site   Machame Hospital  Among formal institutions in Machame, one of the oldest and most renown is the Machame Hospital', ""Official website of Machame Hospital  This medical facility is located off the main north-south road between the post office and the

continuously served the population of Machame, many people travel from other areas to Machame Hospital because of the level of care', '   History of settlement on the mountain    Overview  Chagga history has a long, interesting and yet complex background as noted by the historian M', 'K', ' Stahl', ' It portrays an African heritage and socio-political system which preceded the colonial rule depicting somehow advanced African political systems even during the times of primitive African social lifestyle', ' Machame chiefdom for example, by the mid-1800s had expanded to rule all areas to the western part of Chagga', ' As narrated to Rev', ' Johannine Rebmann while in Kilema, the Chief of Machame had a command in all of the Chagga except Rombo', 'Herrmann, K', ' (1997) Rebmann, Johannes: Tagebuch des Missionars, vom 14', ' Februar 1848-16', ' Februar 1849', ' However, according to M', 'K', ' Stahl, the actual location identified by Machame name was but a small strip of land with total control and influence extending between the two major rivers of Kilimanjaro, i', 'e', ' Kikafu and Weruweru', ' The development therefore of what was later to be known as the greater Machame is of interest in this article including the study on different etymologies and the traditions which are expected to benefit those who study African history', '   Migration to the mountain  The Machame  and Meru people are said to have migrated from the Usambara mountains in Tanga Region 400 years ago to Kilimanjaro Region', ' However, it is not easy to know today when did the modern Chagga started to migrate to the Mountain', "" Many narrations exist, legendary or true, since many African tribes didn't have the tradition of writing down the events in their lifetimes"", ' However, following Machame narrations, who are among the few Chagga families to recall the encounter with the earlier inhabitants on the mountain, it seems that the migration of the later people who came to be called the Chagga, started about 600 years ago', ' The Machame elders recall the encounter of their ancestors with the earlier settlers of the mountain whom they referred to as the Koningo (wataremba), meaning, the pigmies (or mbilikimo in Swahili)', '  Since very few other Chagga clans on the mountain can recall the existence of such people on the mountain, this can mean that the machame ancestors might have been one of the earliest immigrants of the later Chaggas on the mountain', ' They describe the koningo as the short people with big heads carrying hones wherever they went', ' The horns were used for blowing in case one fell down for another one to come and lift him/her up', ' They also used hones to notify others of an important issue that needed caution or assembling', ' They were skilled in hunting and are described as very innocent people', ' However, these were replaced by the now migrating folks although till today the remains of these people can be traced on some parts of the mountain which indicates that some were integrated into the incoming migrants probably through marriage', ' It was historical unfortunate that the later visitors to the mountain thought the Chagga to be one tribe', ' Since they were referred to as the Chagga by the Swahili from the coast, other visitors to the mountain such as missionaries and explorers thought that the mountain was dwelt by one tribe called the Chagga', ' However, this was not the case', '   The people who migrated to the mountain came from completely diverse backgrounds', ' There were those who came from the Usambara mountains, who migrated to the west and some parts of the central area of the mountain, those who migrated from the Kamba origin, especially those who settled to the east of the mountain together with the Taita, and those who had the maasai and waarush background who initially settled in the lower plains of the mountain but slowly some moved up to settle in upper parts of the mountain', ' Different reasons contributed to the migration of these different groups to the mountain, some of them are: Fleeing from drought, famine or epidemics where they had lived', ' A search for a peaceful environment, fleeing from wars and insecurity as they saw the mountainous place to be safer than where they had been', ' A search for a more prosperous land, since the mountainous soil was very fertile with many streams of water and the weather was very promising for agricultural activities', ' Travellers and those who went to the mountain for various activities such as trade, but decided to remain there', '  All these reflect different backgrounds', ' Different backgrounds then mean different languages, cultures, skills and traditions although the fact that majority were of the Bantu origin, it accounted for the similarity of languages, cultures and traditions', ' Different groups came with different skills to the mountain like hunting, forging weapons, war skills, pot making, furrow making, making and collecting honey, etc', ' These various groups intermingled to some degree and their existence on the mountain is what formed what came to be known as Chagga complex', ' All these contributed to the high skills and the brightness that the Chagga people portrayed', '  Etymology of the land At this stage we will look at three important words in the Chagga history, chagga, kilimanjaro and moshi', ' Historian Mary K', ' Stahl and explorer Charles NewNew, Charles (1873)', ' Life, Wanderings and Labours in Eastern Africa', ' Royal Geographical Society: London', ' give their opinions as to the meanings of the first two words', ' The origin of the word Chagga (dschagga or jagga) is not very clear today', ' K', ' Stahl gives differing opinions as to its origin although one of her opinions seem to concur with Charles new\'s meaning of ""getting lost"" or ""to give farewell to someone who is about to take a journey that you are not sure if they will be back (as they may get lost forever)""', "" In earlier Swahili language this would have been called 'kuchaaga' meaning to say bye"", "" Today's Swahili is 'kuaga'"", "" Why the land was attached with the word 'to get lost'? This is where the stories begin"", ' It is claimed that the first coastal trade people to get into the land got lost due to the thick forests', ' As hypothesized by Stahl, it took them days to get their original route again and they thought that their getting lost was mysterious', ' When they went back to the coast they spread this news and the land was called Chaga (or Chagga) as a sign of getting lost', '  Another explanation of the origin of the word, which also missionary Charles New mentioned as he quoted rev', ' Johannine Rebmann, is that the word came out of a terrible event that befell on people', ' The years of the event are not known to us but it was a time when a powerful chief of Machame, Rengua, was ruling and at that time caravans from the coast had already started to get there to trade on ivory with the natives', ' Being constantly instigated by the Swahili people that what is on top of the mountain has to do with silver which promises much richness to his kingdom, Chief Rengua sent a large band of emissary to get as much silver as possible down to him', ' A caravan trader from the coast Bwana Heri who accompanied rev', ' Rebmann to the mountain told him that he actually saw one of the survivors of the tragedy who had become disabled due to freezing temperature as they went up the mountain', ' The rest of the envoy perished on the way', ' The story that survived was that on the mountain there is a spirit that will destroy anyone who would try to get close to it, and the Swahili who were at the court of Rengua, seeing the disaster that had befallen those who went up, spread news to the coast that anyone trying to get higher on the mountain will get lost as the mountain has the dreadful spirit', '  The land was called chaaga as commemoration of the tragedy', ' This story apart from being backed up by the people who were close to the event as recorded in the history books, also connects very well with stories that circulated in the coast when rev', ' Rebmann arrived there on his mission to the Chagga', ' On learning that Rebmann wanted to go to the land of Chagga, the Swahili sultan of Mombasa who was an Arab, warned him that the land is dangerous as there is a spirit on the mountain that destroys people and he might get lost when he tries to do so', "" He mentioned to Rebmann that the name of the spirit (as known in the coast) was 'ndscharo' and hence the mountain was called mountain of ndscharo (i"", 'e', ' kilimandscharo)', "" He could nearly stop Rebmann from going to the land of Chagga if it were not for Rebmann's persistence to go there"", "" However, it shows that earlier the people of Chagga were known as 'wakirima', i"", 'e', ' people of the mountain (kirima was an old Swahili word for a hill)', ' Where they lived was known as the land of Chagga (i', 'e', ' land of getting lost) although later on the name was attached to the people themselves', ""  Of importance however, is the way the name 'Moshi' became prominent among the people of the mountain and by the early 1900s it could almost be used synonymously with the name of the Chagga land"", ' Moshi was one of the chiefdoms in Chagga ruled by Rindi (1860–1890)', ' Before that time the name scarcely surfaced in history although it seemed to be a recognisable location of some prominence', ' For example, in 1849, Rev', ' Rebmann mentions a young man who had come all the way from Moshi to trade honey and milk with his men when they camped at Machame', ' He also records in his diary of trouble in Kirua caused by one Kirumi who was supported by allies from Moshi (where his mother came from) to overthrow his father Marengo', ' This happened when Rev', ' Rebmann and his men were still in Kilema', ' These instances are the first appearances of Moshi in historical records, and just after a decade, Von der Decken records Moshi as a recognisable chiefdom although still not attained some autonomy from Machame as he observed earlier', 'Theil, E', ', Band, Z', "" (1871) Baron Carl Claus von der Decken's Reisen in Ost-Afrika in den Jahren 1862 bis 1865"", ""  During Decken's visit to Chagga a young chief Rindi was ruling in Moshi"", ' With much witticism and intrigue, and under the regency of his mother Mamchaki,Hollis, C', ', Von der Decken', ' Tanganyika Notes Records, 1958', ' Rindi established his chiefdom from a place known as tsudunyi in early 1860 and using the location of his chiefdom as a strategic advantage, directed many caravan traders to the mountain into his land', ' With much ambitions to power he even sabotaged caravans which did not show intention to pass through his chiefdom and those explorers who asked for guidance to other chiefdoms he conspired with his men who misguided them and got them lost or back to his chiefdom', ' However, there are indications that during his early days in power he acquired support from Machame to cleverly establish his presence in the east', ' By the early 1870s he could declare to foreigners that the whole of Chagga was divided into two major powers; Machame under Ndesserua being the greatest in the West and himself an important chief in the east', ' He substantiated his claim by providing a letter to Charles New that granted him safe passage to every chiefdom he could visit to the east of Chagga', '  Having acquired autonomy from Machame through allied raids to the east of Chagga and as far as Usambara, with extraordinary diplomatic schemes, by 1870 he could direct to his capital, Moshi, most missionaries and explorers who started to flock into the Chagga', ' This seemingly well calculated generosity made his chiefdom extremely popular to the coast and to the Europeans', ' Apart from all these well learned visitors to his chiefdom, it was an explorer Sir Henry H', 'H', ' JohnstonJohnston, Sir H', 'H', ' (1886)', ' Kilimanjaro Expedition', ' London', ' in 1884 who attempted to work on the etymology of the land', "" He investigated the meaning of the word 'Moshi' and the answers he got from traditional elders and others was just the variant of its pronunciations, like 'mushi', or 'muschi', 'moschi' etc"", 'etc', ' One thing he was assured was that the name did not relate to the Swahili word for smoke, i', 'e', ' moshi, as Chagga had a different word for that', "" He therefore had to conclude that the word 'probably comes from one of the kichagga terms or word'"", "" It's amazing how at that time couldn't the people of Moshi know the origin of the word for their chiefdom? It is not clear when they told him it was 'mushi' if they meant name of people, a certain locality or another pronunciation"", ' However, a story that circulates now among the natives of the land (which is also repeated by Professor Isaria Kimambo and A', 'J', ' Temu in their bookKimambo, I', 'N', ' and Temu, A', 'J', ' 1971', ' A History of Tanzania', ' Heinemann Educational Publishers: Nairobi', "") is that the name Moshi is a modification of the name of a certain locality near that of Chief Rindi's boma (court), and that place was very popular at that time"", ' The place was known as Kimotchi which was a popular local market in the area', "" But the problem with this theory is how would a chief's neighbouring village become the name of his chiefdom and the transition from Kimotchi to Motchi (or Moshi) is not very clear"", "" Whatever the case is, the fact is that the meaning for the word 'Moshi' as used for Rindi's chiefdom is not clear to us today"", '  Machame as a political establishment  Original Name  M(a)shami Preceded by  Kikafu Basin Settlement                                                                                        Founded  Late 17th Century  The Ruling House  Mushi Royal Family Mushi/Kombe/Shangali Dynasty Traditional Salutation  Kafo Kombe Mushi!

marrow and to chop tough  plant material', '  Bone fragments of birds, fish, amphibians, and large mammals were found at the FLK-Zinj site, many of which were scarred with marks', ' These likely were made by hominins breaking open the bones for marrow, using tools to strip the meat, or by carnivores having gnawed the bones', ' Since several kinds of marks are present together, some archaeologists including Lewis Binford think that hominins scavenged the meat or marrow left over from carnivore kills', ' Others like Henry Bunn believe the hominins hunted and killed these animals, and carnivores later chewed the bones', ' This issue is still debated today, but archaeologist Pat Shipman provided evidence that scavenging was probably the more common practice; she published that the majority of carnivore teeth marks came before the cut marks', ' Another finding by Shipman at FLK-Zinj is that many of the wildebeest bones found there are over-represented by adult and male bones; and this may indicate that hominins were systematically hunting these animals as well as scavenging them', ' The issue of hunting versus gathering at Olduvai Gorge is still a controversial one', '  Hominid fossils

the Tusi have traditionally allowed the Tutsi, with a strong pastoralist tradition, to gain social, economic, and political ascendancy over the Hutu, who were primarily agriculturalists', ' The distinction under colonial powers allowed Tutsis to establish ruling power until a Hutu revolution in 1959 abolished the Tutsi monarchy by 1961', '   The hostility between the two groups continued, as

carrying then-President Juvenal Habyarimana, and Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi was shot down, killing everyone on board', ' The Hutu held the RPF accountable and immediately began the genocide, targeted at both Tutsis and Hutu moderates', '  Most of the killing during the Rwandan genocide was carried out by the radical Hutu groups known as the Interahamwe and the Impuzamugambi', ' Radio broadcasts also were an integral part of the genocide, which further fueled the genocide by encouraging Hutu civilians to kill their Tutsi neighbours, labeled as ""cockroaches"" in need of extermination', ' Despite its colossal scale, particularly within such a short period of time, the genocide was carried out almost entirely by hand, usually with the utilization of machetes and clubs', ' Various atrocities committed include the rape of thousands of Tutsi women, as well as the dismemberment and disfigurement of victims', ' Frequently the killers were people the victims knew personally—neighbors, workmates, former friends, sometimes even relatives through marriage', ' At least 500,000 Tutsis were killed, and approximately 2 million refugees (mostly Hutus) left for refugee

which it was reluctant to do after several of its soldiers were killed during a humanitarian mission in Somalia the previous year', ' Finally in July 1994, after the genocide was over, the UN Security Council called for an investigation of the events, and acted to establish an international criminal tribunal to prosecute those individuals most responsible for the genocide', ' Adopting Resolution

chief Sina) and Kilema"", ' The rapid and certain disintegration of its influence over other Chagga states after an atrocious attack and her subsequent subjugation by Sina of Kibosho in the mid-1889, led to a highly confined influence constrained between Machame itself and a neighbouring ward, Masama, where a frail sultan of Machame seemed to alternate in abode', ' Although by 1889 she was still estimated to comprise almost 20% of all the population of the Chagga, towards the end of the 19th Century Machame distinctly became a lowly chieftaincy still with claims of influence over Masama', '

of the three divisions of the Chagga states by the British rule in 1946 with the recognition of Chief M', 'H', ' Abdiel Shangali of Machame as the divisional chief, could have been none other than

the Chagga states from Weruweru river Eastwards"", ' It was therefore the formation of the Hai division in 1946 that brought back the influence of the Chief of Machame to the Eastern Chagga states beyond Weruweru river', ' However, the redefinition of Chagga politics revived by the formation of divisions by the British rule would soon escalate to set the Chagga politics into the edge, the saga of which is discussed later in this article', '  After Tanganyika independence in 1961, the provinces were abolished and local authorities redefined', ' The Hai division became Hai district which mainly included the Kilimanjaro area West of Weruweru river, hence, roughly comprising the old Chagga states once identified as the confederation under the ruler of Machame', ' In 2005, Siha became a new constituency separate from the Hai district', ' Today Machame-Masama form the Hai constituency separated by the Kikafu river, with Machame to its East and Masama to the West', "" Out of 10 wards

over again, a careful study of Chagga history and Machame in particular seems to amazingly confirm the theory of historic recurrence,G', 'W', ' Trompf, The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought, passim', ' where events repeat with patterns strikingly similar to what had happened before, even to the decisions made by authorities that have no clue to her historical past', '  Ever since

1990s and later, the flumes are still used and maintained for agricultural irrigation', '  We will observe in this article that, although there is a particular location identified as Machame, due to historical reasons, the study will inevitably present Machame and Masama as a composite narrative and classical discourse as this seems to be the case ever since before Masama got that identity

period, coffee has been an important cash crop for export; however, its prominence has decreased in recent decades', ' As noted by Mbonile, et al', ', declining prices for exports have influenced

' Kilimanjaro) have changed broadly over the past 120 years—even more dramatically in the post-independence period', ' Specifically, increasing agricultural planting in the bottom three of the five climatic zones of Kilimanjaro has reduced native vegetation', ' Agriculture in Machame fits generally into two modes: home gardens consisting of multipurpose trees interspersed with food crops near

history has a long, interesting and yet complex background as noted by the historian M', 'K', ' Stahl', ' It portrays an African heritage and socio-political system which preceded the colonial rule depicting somehow advanced African political systems even during the times of primitive African social lifestyle', ' Machame chiefdom for example, by the mid-1800s had expanded to rule all areas to the western part of Chagga', ' As narrated to Rev', ' Johannine Rebmann while in Kilema, the Chief of Machame had a command in all of the Chagga except Rombo', 'Herrmann, K', ' (1997) Rebmann, Johannes: Tagebuch des Missionars, vom 14', ' Februar 1848-16', ' Februar 1849', ' However, according to M', 'K', ' Stahl, the actual location identified by Machame name was but a small strip of land with total control and influence extending between the two major rivers of Kilimanjaro, i', 'e', ' Kikafu and Weruweru', ' The development therefore of what was later to be known as the greater Machame is of interest in this article including the study on different etymologies and the traditions which are expected to benefit those who study African history', '   Migration to the mountain  The Machame  and Meru people are said to have migrated from the Usambara mountains in Tanga Region 400 years ago to Kilimanjaro Region', ' However, it is not easy to know today when did the modern Chagga started to migrate to the Mountain', "" Many narrations exist, legendary or true, since many African tribes didn't have the tradition of writing down the events in their lifetimes"", ' However, following Machame narrations, who are among the few Chagga families to recall the encounter with the earlier inhabitants on the mountain, it seems that the migration of the later people who came to be called the Chagga, started about 600 years ago', ' The Machame elders recall the encounter of their ancestors with the earlier settlers of the mountain whom they referred to as the Koningo (wataremba), meaning, the pigmies (or mbilikimo in Swahili)', '  Since very few other Chagga clans on the mountain can recall the existence of such people on the mountain, this can mean that the machame ancestors might have been one of the earliest immigrants of the later Chaggas on the mountain', ' They describe the koningo as the short people with big heads carrying hones wherever they went', ' The horns were used for blowing in case one fell down for another one to come and lift him/her up', ' They also used hones to notify others of an important issue that needed caution or assembling', ' They were skilled in hunting and are described as very innocent people', ' However, these were replaced by the now migrating folks although till today the remains of these people can be traced on some parts of the mountain which indicates that some were integrated into the incoming migrants probably through marriage', ' It was historical unfortunate that the later visitors to the mountain thought the Chagga to be one tribe', ' Since they were referred to as the Chagga by the Swahili from the coast, other visitors to the mountain such as missionaries and explorers thought that the mountain was dwelt by one tribe called the Chagga', ' However, this was not the case', '   The people who migrated to the mountain came from completely diverse backgrounds', ' There were those who came from the Usambara mountains, who migrated to the west and some parts of the central area of the mountain, those who migrated from the Kamba origin, especially those who settled to the east of the mountain together with the Taita, and those who had the maasai and waarush background who initially settled in the lower plains of the mountain but slowly some moved up to settle in upper parts of the mountain', ' Different reasons contributed to the migration of these different groups to the mountain, some of them are: Fleeing from drought, famine or epidemics where they had lived', ' A search for a peaceful environment, fleeing from wars and insecurity as they saw the mountainous place to be safer than where they had been', ' A search for a more prosperous land, since the mountainous soil was very fertile with many streams of water and the weather was very promising for agricultural activities', ' Travellers and those who went to the mountain for various activities such as trade, but decided to remain there', '  All these reflect different backgrounds', ' Different backgrounds then mean different languages, cultures, skills and traditions although the fact that majority were of the Bantu origin, it accounted for the similarity of languages, cultures and traditions', ' Different groups came with different skills to the mountain like hunting, forging weapons, war skills, pot making, furrow making, making and collecting honey, etc', ' These various groups intermingled to some degree and their existence on the mountain is what formed what came to be known as Chagga complex', ' All these contributed to the high skills and the brightness that the Chagga people portrayed', '  Etymology of the land At this stage we will look at three important words in the Chagga history, chagga, kilimanjaro and moshi', ' Historian Mary K', ' Stahl and explorer Charles NewNew, Charles (1873)', ' Life, Wanderings and Labours in Eastern Africa', ' Royal Geographical Society: London', ' give their opinions as to the meanings of the first two words', ' The origin of the word Chagga (dschagga or jagga) is not very clear today', ' K', ' Stahl gives differing opinions as to its origin although one of her opinions seem to concur with Charles new\'s meaning of ""getting lost"" or ""to give farewell to someone who is about to take a journey that you are not sure if they will be back (as they may get lost forever)""', "" In earlier Swahili language this would have been called 'kuchaaga' meaning to say bye"", "" Today's Swahili is 'kuaga'"", "" Why the land was attached with the word 'to get lost'? This is where the stories begin"", ' It is claimed that the first coastal trade people to get into the land got lost due to the thick forests', ' As hypothesized by Stahl, it took them days to get their original route again and they thought that their getting lost was mysterious', ' When they went back to the coast they spread this news and the land was called Chaga (or Chagga) as a sign of getting lost', '  Another explanation of the origin of the word, which also missionary Charles New mentioned as he quoted rev', ' Johannine Rebmann, is that the word came out of a terrible event that befell on people', ' The years of the event are not known to us but it was a time when a powerful chief of Machame, Rengua, was ruling and at that time caravans from the coast had already started to get there to trade on ivory with the natives', ' Being constantly instigated by the Swahili people that what is on top of the mountain has to do with silver which promises much richness to his kingdom, Chief Rengua sent a large band of emissary to get as much silver as possible down to him', ' A caravan trader from the coast Bwana Heri who accompanied rev', ' Rebmann to the mountain told him that he actually saw one of the survivors of the tragedy who had become disabled due to freezing temperature as they went up the mountain', ' The rest of the envoy perished on the way', ' The story that survived was that on the mountain there is a spirit that will destroy anyone who would try to get close to it, and the Swahili who were at the court of Rengua, seeing the disaster that had befallen those who went up, spread news to the coast that anyone trying to get higher on the mountain will get lost as the mountain has the dreadful spirit', '  The land was called chaaga as commemoration of the tragedy', ' This story apart from being backed up by the people who were close to the event as recorded in the history books, also connects very well with stories that circulated in the coast when rev', ' Rebmann arrived there on his mission to the Chagga', ' On learning that Rebmann wanted to go to the land of Chagga, the Swahili sultan of Mombasa who was an Arab, warned him that the land is dangerous as there is a spirit on the mountain that destroys people and he might get lost when he tries to do so', "" He mentioned to Rebmann that the name of the spirit (as known in the coast) was 'ndscharo' and hence the mountain was called mountain of ndscharo (i"", 'e', ' kilimandscharo)', "" He could nearly stop Rebmann from going to the land of Chagga if it were not for Rebmann's persistence to go there"", "" However, it shows that earlier the people of Chagga were known as 'wakirima', i"", 'e', ' people of the mountain (kirima was an old Swahili word for a hill)', ' Where they lived was known as the land of Chagga (i', 'e', ' land of getting lost) although later on the name was attached to the people themselves', ""  Of importance however, is the way the name 'Moshi' became prominent among the people of the mountain and by the early 1900s it could almost be used synonymously with the name of the Chagga land"", ' Moshi was one of the chiefdoms in Chagga ruled by Rindi (1860–1890)', ' Before that time the name scarcely surfaced in history although it seemed to be a recognisable location of some prominence', ' For example, in 1849, Rev', ' Rebmann mentions a young man who had come all the way from Moshi to trade honey and milk with his men when they camped at Machame', ' He also records in his diary of trouble in Kirua caused by one Kirumi who was supported by allies from Moshi (where his mother came from) to overthrow his father Marengo', ' This happened when Rev', ' Rebmann and his men were still in Kilema', ' These instances are the first appearances of Moshi in historical records, and just after a decade, Von der Decken records Moshi as a recognisable chiefdom although still not attained some autonomy from Machame as he observed earlier', 'Theil, E', ', Band, Z', "" (1871) Baron Carl Claus von der Decken's Reisen in Ost-Afrika in den Jahren 1862 bis 1865"", ""  During Decken's visit to Chagga a young chief Rindi was ruling in Moshi"", ' With much witticism and intrigue, and under the regency of his mother Mamchaki,Hollis, C', ', Von der Decken', ' Tanganyika Notes Records, 1958', ' Rindi established his chiefdom from a place known as tsudunyi in early 1860 and using the location of his chiefdom as a strategic advantage, directed many caravan traders to the mountain into his land', ' With much ambitions to power he even sabotaged caravans which did not show intention to pass through his chiefdom and those explorers who asked for guidance to other chiefdoms he conspired with his men who misguided them and got them lost or back to his chiefdom', ' However, there are indications that during his early days in power he acquired support from Machame to cleverly establish his presence in the east', ' By the early 1870s he could declare to foreigners that the whole of Chagga was divided into two major powers; Machame under Ndesserua being the greatest in the West and himself an important chief in the east', ' He substantiated his claim by providing a letter to Charles New that granted him safe passage to every chiefdom he could visit to the east of Chagga', '  Having acquired autonomy from Machame through allied raids to the east of Chagga and as far as Usambara, with extraordinary diplomatic schemes, by 1870 he could direct to his capital, Moshi, most missionaries and explorers who started to flock into the Chagga', ' This seemingly well calculated generosity made his chiefdom extremely popular to the coast and to the Europeans', ' Apart from all these well learned visitors to his chiefdom, it was an explorer Sir Henry H', 'H', ' JohnstonJohnston, Sir H', 'H', ' (1886)', ' Kilimanjaro Expedition', ' London', ' in 1884 who attempted to work on the etymology of the land', "" He investigated the meaning of the word 'Moshi' and the answers he got from traditional elders and others was just the variant of its pronunciations, like 'mushi', or 'muschi', 'moschi' etc"", 'etc', ' One thing he was assured was that the name did not relate to the Swahili word for smoke, i', 'e', ' moshi, as Chagga had a different word for that', "" He therefore had to conclude that the word 'probably comes from one of the kichagga terms or word'"", "" It's amazing how at that time couldn't the people of Moshi know the origin of the word for their chiefdom? It is not clear when they told him it was 'mushi' if they meant name of people, a certain locality or another pronunciation"", ' However, a story that circulates now among the natives of the land (which is also repeated by Professor Isaria Kimambo and A', 'J', ' Temu in their bookKimambo, I', 'N', ' and Temu, A', 'J', ' 1971', ' A History of Tanzania', ' Heinemann Educational Publishers: Nairobi', "") is that the name Moshi is a modification of the name of a certain locality near that of Chief Rindi's boma (court), and that place was very popular at that time"", ' The place was known as Kimotchi which was a popular local market in the area', "" But the problem with this theory is how would a chief's neighbouring village become the name of his chiefdom and the transition from Kimotchi to Motchi (or Moshi) is not very clear"", "" Whatever the case is, the fact is that the meaning for the word 'Moshi' as used for Rindi's chiefdom is not clear to us today"", '  Machame as a political establishment  Original Name  M(a)shami Preceded by  Kikafu Basin Settlement                                                                                        Founded  Late 17th Century  The Ruling House  Mushi Royal Family Mushi/Kombe/Shangali Dynasty Traditional Salutation  Kafo Kombe Mushi!

comparative studies with a close relative of early hominins: the modern chimpanzee', "" The chimpanzee's diet in the wild consists of only about five percent as meat"", ' And the diets of modern hunter-gatherers do not include a large amount of meat', "" That is, most of the calories in both groups' diets came from plant sources"", ' Thus, it can be assumed that early hominins had similar diet proportions, (see the middle-range theory or bridging arguments—bridging arguments are used by archaeologists to explain past behaviors, and they include an underlying assumption of uniformitarianism', ')  Much of the information about early hominins comes from tools and debris piles of lithic flakes from such sites as FLK-Zinjanthropus in Olduvai Gorge', ' Early hominins selected specific types of rocks that would break in a predictable manner when ""worked"", and carried these rocks from deposits several kilometres away', ' Archaeologists such as Fiona Marshall

successfully produce sharp-edged flakes ', '', '', '""', ' She noted that selected flakes then were used to cut meat from animal carcasses, and shaped cobbles (called choppers) were used to extract marrow and to chop tough  plant material', '  Bone fragments of birds, fish, amphibians, and large mammals were found at the FLK-Zinj site, many of which were scarred with marks', ' These likely were made by hominins breaking open the bones for marrow, using tools to strip the meat, or by carnivores having gnawed the bones', ' Since several kinds of marks are present together, some archaeologists including Lewis Binford think that hominins scavenged the meat or marrow left over from carnivore kills', ' Others like Henry Bunn believe the hominins hunted and killed these animals, and carnivores later chewed the bones', ' This issue is still debated today, but archaeologist Pat Shipman provided evidence that scavenging was probably the more common practice; she published that the majority of carnivore teeth marks came before the cut marks', ' Another finding by Shipman at FLK-Zinj is that many of the wildebeest bones found there are over-represented by adult and male bones; and this may indicate that hominins were systematically hunting these animals as well as scavenging them', ' The issue of hunting versus gathering at Olduvai Gorge is still a controversial one', '  Hominid fossils

Stuttgart, Kornthal', ' By the 1860s, a German explorer Von der Decken (popularly known to the Chagga as Baroni), presented Machame as a confederation of western Chagga states comprising Narumu, Kindi, Kombo, to as far as the Western end of Kibongoto, each with their own chiefs under the king of Machame', 'Kersten, Otto (1869)', "" Baron Carl Claus von der Decken's Reisen in Ost-Afrika in den Jahren 1859-1865: C"", 'F', ' Winter', "" 'Baroni' observed that by that time only two of the Chagga states had some autonomy from the king of Machame, namely, Lambongo (later Kibosho under powerful chief Sina) and Kilema"", ' The rapid and certain disintegration of its influence over other Chagga states after an atrocious attack and her subsequent subjugation by Sina of Kibosho in the mid-1889, led to a highly confined influence constrained between Machame itself and a neighbouring ward, Masama, where a frail sultan of Machame seemed to alternate in abode', ' Although by 1889 she was still estimated to comprise almost 20% of all the population of the Chagga, towards the end of the 19th Century Machame distinctly became a lowly chieftaincy still with claims of influence over Masama', ' Today Machame retains some of its beauty once praised by missionaries and explorers of the 19th century, with much of historical sites that remind of her admired historical past', ' The exciting view of mount Kilimanjaro from Machame and the adventurous route to its peak has continued to be the source of tourist attraction to this once a giant African state', '  The name ""Machame"" therefore refers to an ethnic and linguistic group of people occupying this area historically as its homeland, as well as the specific location', '   Machame language  Although sometimes lumped with other Chaga languages, Machame is a distinct language (also known as ""Kimachame"" in Swahili and as ""Kimashame"" or ""Kimashami"" in the Machame language itself', '  For most inhabitants of Machame and Masama (i', 'e', ', the Machame ""tribe""), including children born and raised in this area, Kimachame is their first language; Swahili and English are learned via formal schooling', '   Geography  Physically, the location identified today as Machame forms several of 10 wards of the Hai District, in Kilimanjaro Region, Tanzania', 'Wikipedia: Hai District Historically, the formation of Hai as one of the three divisions of the Chagga states by the British rule in 1946 with the recognition of Chief M', 'H', ' Abdiel Shangali of Machame as the divisional chief, could have been none other than tracing back the Chagga politics to its old pre-German colonial rule where the then King of Machame extended his influence', ' The Hai division comprised Chagga states from Siha in the Western-end of Chagga to river Nanga, forming a rough boundary within Vunjo to the further Eastern Chagga states of Rombo', 'Stahl, Kathleen Mary (1964)', ' History of the Chagga People of Kilimanjaro', ' Mouton Publication: London', ' By 1920s however, due to successive political instability and confusion in the obscure state of Siha, supposedly instigated by the Machame political aristocrats, Chief Abdiel Shangali of Machame re-claimed Siha by implying that ""the efforts to make it independent from Machame have failed""', "" Since the 1880s to 1946, Machame had lost 'for good' its influence over all the Chagga states from Weruweru river Eastwards"", ' It was therefore the formation of the Hai division in 1946 that brought back the influence of the Chief of Machame to the Eastern Chagga states beyond Weruweru river', ' However, the redefinition of Chagga politics revived by the formation of divisions by the British rule would soon escalate to set the Chagga politics into the edge, the saga of which is discussed later in this article', '  After Tanganyika independence in 1961, the provinces were abolished and local authorities redefined', ' The Hai division became Hai district which mainly included the Kilimanjaro area West of Weruweru river, hence, roughly comprising the old Chagga states once identified as the confederation under the ruler of Machame', ' In 2005, Siha became a new constituency separate from the Hai district', ' Today Machame-Masama form the Hai constituency separated by the Kikafu river, with Machame to its East and Masama to the West', "" Out of 10 wards that comprise the Hai constituency, 6 form part of Machame and 4 are Masama's"", ' This division though, seems again to repeat the history of Machame chiefdom in the late 1880s and 1890s', ' Over and over again, a careful study of Chagga history and Machame in particular seems to amazingly confirm the theory of historic recurrence,G', 'W', ' Trompf, The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought, passim', ' where events repeat with patterns strikingly similar to what had happened before, even to the decisions made by authorities that have no clue to her historical past', '  Ever since the latter part of the 20th century, the Machame Gate and Machame Camp have become the two locations in the Machame area most known to tourists visiting Tanzania, because these form part of the Machame route for treks ascending Mt', ' Kilimanjaro', ' There is one major, paved road traversing Machame', ' It begins at the south end stemming from the A23 Arusha-to-Himo main road (which also connects Moshi to Arusha)', ' This intersection is 15\xa0km from Moshi and 75\xa0km from Arusha', ' The name of this intersection is commonly ""Kilimanjaro Machine Tools"", after the defunct business of the same name which left an abandoned building at the south edge of this intersection', ' This road proceeds north until it reaches the Machame Gate at the entrance to Kilimanjaro National Park', ' Several secondary, unpaved roads connect points within Machame', '  Machame is traversed by several rivers that flow year-round within deep gorges running down the slopes of Mt', ' Kilimanjaro', ' In addition to the natural rivers, there are systems of flumes for irrigation that pre-date the colonial era', ' Although major infrastructure project spread piped water through much of the area in the 1990s and later, the flumes are still used and maintained for agricultural irrigation', '  We will observe in this article that, although there is a particular location identified as Machame, due to historical reasons, the study will inevitably present Machame and Masama as a composite narrative and classical discourse as this seems to be the case ever since before Masama got that identity between 1860-1870', ' The presentation will alternate between the Machame as a confederation of Chagga states West of river Weruweru (by the 1860s), Machame as narrowly defining the Machame-Masama state by the end of the 1880s, and Machame as a location that bears that name (i', 'e', ' pre-1800 identity)', '   Economy and agricultural practices  The majority of residents of Machame, like in many other rural areas of Tanzania, earn a living through agriculture', ' The year-round temperate climate and fairly high humidity allow cultivation of a huge variety of crops', ' Since the colonial period, coffee has been an important cash crop for export; however, its prominence has decreased in recent decades', ' As noted by Mbonile, et al', ', declining prices for exports have influenced farmers to replace coffee with annual crops like tomatoes, of which the surplus may be sold and consumed regionally', ' The overall land-use pattern in Machame (and surrounding foothill areas of Mt', ' Kilimanjaro) have changed broadly over the past 120 years—even more dramatically in the post-independence period', ' Specifically, increasing agricultural planting in the bottom three of the five climatic zones of Kilimanjaro has reduced native vegetation', ' Agriculture in Machame fits generally into two modes: home gardens consisting of multipurpose trees interspersed with food crops near houses, and the ""shamba"" lands, or small fields, where food crops like maize, finger millet, and beans are grown', 'LUCID Working Paper #25, M', 'J', ' Mbonile, S', 'B', ' Misana, C', ' Sokoni', '

two designated market days each week', ' Machame is also dotted with other small businesses such as mills for grain and presses for sunflower oil', '  With the growing use of the Machame Route through

continuously served the population of Machame, many people travel from other areas to Machame Hospital because of the level of care', '   History of settlement on the mountain    Overview  Chagga history has a long, interesting and yet complex background as noted by the historian M', 'K', ' Stahl', ' It portrays an African heritage and socio-political system which preceded the colonial rule depicting somehow advanced African political systems even during the times of primitive African social lifestyle', ' Machame chiefdom for example, by the mid-1800s had expanded to rule all areas to the western part of Chagga', ' As narrated to Rev', ' Johannine Rebmann while in Kilema, the Chief of Machame had a command in all of the Chagga except Rombo', 'Herrmann, K', ' (1997) Rebmann, Johannes: Tagebuch des Missionars, vom 14', ' Februar 1848-16', ' Februar 1849', ' However, according to M', 'K', ' Stahl, the actual location identified by Machame name was but a small strip of land with total control and influence extending between the two major rivers of Kilimanjaro, i', 'e', ' Kikafu and Weruweru', ' The development therefore of what was later to be known as the greater Machame is of interest in this article including the study on different etymologies and the traditions which are expected to benefit those who study African history', '   Migration to the mountain  The Machame  and Meru people are said to have migrated from the Usambara mountains in Tanga Region 400 years ago to Kilimanjaro Region', ' However, it is not easy to know today when did the modern Chagga started to migrate to the Mountain', "" Many narrations exist, legendary or true, since many African tribes didn't have the tradition of writing down the events in their lifetimes"", ' However, following Machame narrations, who are among the few Chagga families to recall the encounter with the earlier inhabitants on the mountain, it seems that the migration of the later people who came to be called the Chagga, started about 600 years ago', ' The Machame elders recall the encounter of their ancestors with the earlier settlers of the mountain whom they referred to as the Koningo (wataremba), meaning, the pigmies (or mbilikimo in Swahili)', '  Since very few other Chagga clans on the mountain can recall the existence of such people on the mountain, this can mean that the machame ancestors might have been one of the earliest immigrants of the later Chaggas on the mountain', ' They describe the koningo as the short people with big heads carrying hones wherever they went', ' The horns were used for blowing in case one fell down for another one to come and lift him/her up', ' They also used hones to notify others of an important issue that needed caution or assembling', ' They were skilled in hunting and are described as very innocent people', ' However, these were replaced by the now migrating folks although till today the remains of these people can be traced on some parts of the mountain which indicates that some were integrated into the incoming migrants probably through marriage', ' It was historical unfortunate that the later visitors to the mountain thought the Chagga to be one tribe', ' Since they were referred to as the Chagga by the Swahili from the coast, other visitors to the mountain such as missionaries and explorers thought that the mountain was dwelt by one tribe called the Chagga', ' However, this was not the case', '   The people who migrated to the mountain came from completely diverse backgrounds', ' There were those who came from the Usambara mountains, who migrated to the west and some parts of the central area of the mountain, those who migrated from the Kamba origin, especially those who settled to the east of the mountain together with the Taita, and those who had the maasai and waarush background who initially settled in the lower plains of the mountain but slowly some moved up to settle in upper parts of the mountain', ' Different reasons contributed to the migration of these different groups to the mountain, some of them are: Fleeing from drought, famine or epidemics where they had lived', ' A search for a peaceful environment, fleeing from wars and insecurity as they saw the mountainous place to be safer than where they had been', ' A search for a more prosperous land, since the mountainous soil was very fertile with many streams of water and the weather was very promising for agricultural activities', ' Travellers and those who went to the mountain for various activities such as trade, but decided to remain there', '  All these reflect different backgrounds', ' Different backgrounds then mean different languages, cultures, skills and traditions although the fact that majority were of the Bantu origin, it accounted for the similarity of languages, cultures and traditions', ' Different groups came with different skills to the mountain like hunting, forging weapons, war skills, pot making, furrow making, making and collecting honey, etc', ' These various groups intermingled to some degree and their existence on the mountain is what formed what came to be known as Chagga complex', ' All these contributed to the high skills and the brightness that the Chagga people portrayed', '  Etymology of the land At this stage we will look at three important words in the Chagga history, chagga, kilimanjaro and moshi', ' Historian Mary K', ' Stahl and explorer Charles NewNew, Charles (1873)', ' Life, Wanderings and Labours in Eastern Africa', ' Royal Geographical Society: London', ' give their opinions as to the meanings of the first two words', ' The origin of the word Chagga (dschagga or jagga) is not very clear today', ' K', ' Stahl gives differing opinions as to its origin although one of her opinions seem to concur with Charles new\'s meaning of ""getting lost"" or ""to give farewell to someone who is about to take a journey that you are not sure if they will be back (as they may get lost forever)""', "" In earlier Swahili language this would have been called 'kuchaaga' meaning to say bye"", "" Today's Swahili is 'kuaga'"", "" Why the land was attached with the word 'to get lost'? This is where the stories begin"", ' It is claimed that the first coastal trade people to get into the land got lost due to the thick forests', ' As hypothesized by Stahl, it took them days to get their original route again and they thought that their getting lost was mysterious', ' When they went back to the coast they spread this news and the land was called Chaga (or Chagga) as a sign of getting lost', '  Another explanation of the origin of the word, which also missionary Charles New mentioned as he quoted rev', ' Johannine Rebmann, is that the word came out of a terrible event that befell on people', ' The years of the event are not known to us but it was a time when a powerful chief of Machame, Rengua, was ruling and at that time caravans from the coast had already started to get there to trade on ivory with the natives', ' Being constantly instigated by the Swahili people that what is on top of the mountain has to do with silver which promises much richness to his kingdom, Chief Rengua sent a large band of emissary to get as much silver as possible down to him', ' A caravan trader from the coast Bwana Heri who accompanied rev', ' Rebmann to the mountain told him that he actually saw one of the survivors of the tragedy who had become disabled due to freezing temperature as they went up the mountain', ' The rest of the envoy perished on the way', ' The story that survived was that on the mountain there is a spirit that will destroy anyone who would try to get close to it, and the Swahili who were at the court of Rengua, seeing the disaster that had befallen those who went up, spread news to the coast that anyone trying to get higher on the mountain will get lost as the mountain has the dreadful spirit', '  The land was called chaaga as commemoration of the tragedy', ' This story apart from being backed up by the people who were close to the event as recorded in the history books, also connects very well with stories that circulated in the coast when rev', ' Rebmann arrived there on his mission to the Chagga', ' On learning that Rebmann wanted to go to the land of Chagga, the Swahili sultan of Mombasa who was an Arab, warned him that the land is dangerous as there is a spirit on the mountain that destroys people and he might get lost when he tries to do so', "" He mentioned to Rebmann that the name of the spirit (as known in the coast) was 'ndscharo' and hence the mountain was called mountain of ndscharo (i"", 'e', ' kilimandscharo)', "" He could nearly stop Rebmann from going to the land of Chagga if it were not for Rebmann's persistence to go there"", "" However, it shows that earlier the people of Chagga were known as 'wakirima', i"", 'e', ' people of the mountain (kirima was an old Swahili word for a hill)', ' Where they lived was known as the land of Chagga (i', 'e', ' land of getting lost) although later on the name was attached to the people themselves', ""  Of importance however, is the way the name 'Moshi' became prominent among the people of the mountain and by the early 1900s it could almost be used synonymously with the name of the Chagga land"", ' Moshi was one of the chiefdoms in Chagga ruled by Rindi (1860–1890)', ' Before that time the name scarcely surfaced in history although it seemed to be a recognisable location of some prominence', ' For example, in 1849, Rev', ' Rebmann mentions a young man who had come all the way from Moshi to trade honey and milk with his men when they camped at Machame', ' He also records in his diary of trouble in Kirua caused by one Kirumi who was supported by allies from Moshi (where his mother came from) to overthrow his father Marengo', ' This happened when Rev', ' Rebmann and his men were still in Kilema', ' These instances are the first appearances of Moshi in historical records, and just after a decade, Von der Decken records Moshi as a recognisable chiefdom although still not attained some autonomy from Machame as he observed earlier', 'Theil, E', ', Band, Z', "" (1871) Baron Carl Claus von der Decken's Reisen in Ost-Afrika in den Jahren 1862 bis 1865"", ""  During Decken's visit to Chagga a young chief Rindi was ruling in Moshi"", ' With much witticism and intrigue, and under the regency of his mother Mamchaki,Hollis, C', ', Von der Decken', ' Tanganyika Notes Records, 1958', ' Rindi established his chiefdom from a place known as tsudunyi in early 1860 and using the location of his chiefdom as a strategic advantage, directed many caravan traders to the mountain into his land', ' With much ambitions to power he even sabotaged caravans which did not show intention to pass through his chiefdom and those explorers who asked for guidance to other chiefdoms he conspired with his men who misguided them and got them lost or back to his chiefdom', ' However, there are indications that during his early days in power he acquired support from Machame to cleverly establish his presence in the east', ' By the early 1870s he could declare to foreigners that the whole of Chagga was divided into two major powers; Machame under Ndesserua being the greatest in the West and himself an important chief in the east', ' He substantiated his claim by providing a letter to Charles New that granted him safe passage to every chiefdom he could visit to the east of Chagga', '  Having acquired autonomy from Machame through allied raids to the east of Chagga and as far as Usambara, with extraordinary diplomatic schemes, by 1870 he could direct to his capital, Moshi, most missionaries and explorers who started to flock into the Chagga', ' This seemingly well calculated generosity made his chiefdom extremely popular to the coast and to the Europeans', ' Apart from all these well learned visitors to his chiefdom, it was an explorer Sir Henry H', 'H', ' JohnstonJohnston, Sir H', 'H', ' (1886)', ' Kilimanjaro Expedition', ' London', ' in 1884 who attempted to work on the etymology of the land', "" He investigated the meaning of the word 'Moshi' and the answers he got from traditional elders and others was just the variant of its pronunciations, like 'mushi', or 'muschi', 'moschi' etc"", 'etc', ' One thing he was assured was that the name did not relate to the Swahili word for smoke, i', 'e', ' moshi, as Chagga had a different word for that', "" He therefore had to conclude that the word 'probably comes from one of the kichagga terms or word'"", "" It's amazing how at that time couldn't the people of Moshi know the origin of the word for their chiefdom?

chief Sina) and Kilema"", ' The rapid and certain disintegration of its influence over other Chagga states after an atrocious attack and her subsequent subjugation by Sina of Kibosho in the mid-1889, led to a highly confined influence constrained between Machame itself and a neighbouring ward, Masama, where a frail sultan of Machame seemed to alternate in abode', ' Although by 1889 she was still estimated to comprise almost 20% of all the population of the Chagga, towards the end of the 19th Century Machame distinctly became a lowly chieftaincy still with claims of influence over Masama', ' Today Machame retains some of its beauty once praised by missionaries and explorers of the 19th century, with much of historical sites that remind of her admired historical past', ' The exciting view of mount Kilimanjaro from Machame and the adventurous route to its peak has continued to be the source of tourist attraction to this once a giant African state', '  The name ""Machame"" therefore refers to an ethnic and linguistic group of people occupying this area historically as its homeland, as well as the specific location', '   Machame language  Although sometimes lumped with other Chaga

of the three divisions of the Chagga states by the British rule in 1946 with the recognition of Chief M', 'H', ' Abdiel Shangali of Machame as the divisional chief, could have been none other than tracing back the Chagga politics to its old pre-German colonial rule where the then King of Machame extended his influence', ' The Hai division comprised Chagga states from Siha in the Western-end of

Shangali of Machame re-claimed Siha by implying that ""the efforts to make it independent from Machame have failed""', "" Since the 1880s to 1946, Machame had lost 'for good' its influence over all the Chagga states from Weruweru river Eastwards"", ' It was therefore the formation of the Hai division in 1946 that brought back the influence of the Chief of Machame to the Eastern Chagga states beyond Weruweru river', ' However, the redefinition of Chagga politics revived by the formation of divisions by the British rule would soon escalate to set the Chagga politics into the edge, the saga of which is discussed later in this article', '  After Tanganyika independence in 1961, the provinces were abolished and local authorities redefined', ' The Hai division became Hai district which mainly included the Kilimanjaro area West of Weruweru river, hence, roughly comprising the old Chagga states once identified as the confederation under the ruler of Machame', ' In 2005, Siha became a new constituency separate from the Hai district', ' Today Machame-Masama form the Hai constituency separated by the Kikafu river, with Machame to its East and Masama to the West', "" Out of 10 wards that comprise the Hai constituency, 6 form part of Machame and 4 are Masama's"", ' This division though, seems again to repeat the history of Machame chiefdom in the late 1880s and 1890s', ' Over and over again, a careful study of Chagga history and Machame in particular seems to amazingly confirm the theory of historic recurrence,G', 'W', ' Trompf, The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought, passim', ' where events repeat with patterns strikingly similar to what had happened before, even to the decisions made by authorities that have no clue to her historical past', '  Ever since

of the same name which left an abandoned building at the south edge of this intersection', ' This road proceeds north until it reaches the Machame Gate at the entrance to Kilimanjaro National Park', ' Several secondary, unpaved roads connect points within Machame', '  Machame is traversed by several rivers that flow year-round within deep gorges running down the slopes of Mt', ' Kilimanjaro', ' In addition to the natural rivers, there are systems of flumes for irrigation that pre-date the colonial era', ' Although major infrastructure project spread piped water through much of the area in the 1990s and later, the flumes are still used and maintained for agricultural irrigation', '  We will observe in this article that, although there is a particular location identified as Machame, due to historical reasons, the study will inevitably present Machame and Masama as a composite narrative and classical discourse as this seems to be the case ever since before Masama got that identity between 1860-1870', ' The presentation will alternate between the Machame as a confederation of Chagga states West of river Weruweru (by the 1860s), Machame as narrowly defining the Machame-Masama state by the end of the 1880s, and Machame as a location that bears that name (i', 'e', ' pre-1800 identity)', '   Economy and agricultural practices  The majority of residents of Machame, like in many other rural areas of Tanzania, earn a living through agriculture', ' The year-round temperate climate and fairly high humidity allow cultivation of a huge variety of crops', ' Since the colonial period, coffee has been an important cash crop for export; however, its prominence has decreased in recent decades', ' As noted by Mbonile, et al', ', declining prices for exports have influenced farmers to replace coffee with annual crops like tomatoes, of which the surplus may be sold and consumed regionally', ' The overall land-use pattern in Machame (and surrounding foothill areas of Mt', ' Kilimanjaro) have changed broadly over the past 120 years—even more dramatically in the post-independence period', ' Specifically, increasing agricultural planting in the bottom three of the five climatic zones of Kilimanjaro has reduced native vegetation', ' Agriculture in Machame fits generally into two modes: home gardens consisting of multipurpose trees interspersed with food crops near houses, and the ""shamba"" lands, or small fields, where food crops like maize, finger millet, and beans are grown', 'LUCID Working Paper #25, M', 'J', ' Mbonile, S', 'B', ' Misana, C', ' Sokoni', '

Machame is of interest in this article including the study on different etymologies and the traditions which are expected to benefit those who study African history', '   Migration to the mountain  The Machame  and Meru people are said to have migrated from the Usambara mountains in Tanga Region 400 years ago to Kilimanjaro Region', ' However, it is not easy to know today when did the modern Chagga started to migrate to the Mountain', "" Many narrations exist, legendary or true, since many African tribes didn't have the tradition of writing down the events in their lifetimes"", ' However, following Machame narrations, who are among the few Chagga families to recall the encounter with the earlier inhabitants on the mountain, it seems that the migration of the later people who came to be called the Chagga, started about 600 years ago', ' The Machame elders recall the encounter of their ancestors with the earlier settlers of the mountain whom they referred to as the Koningo (wataremba), meaning, the pigmies (or mbilikimo in Swahili)', '  Since very few other Chagga clans on the mountain can recall the existence of such people on the mountain, this can mean that the machame ancestors might have been one of the earliest immigrants of the later Chaggas on the mountain', ' They describe the koningo as the short people with big heads carrying hones wherever they went', ' The horns were used for blowing in case one fell down for another one to come and lift him/her up', ' They also used hones to notify others of an important issue that needed caution or assembling', ' They were skilled in hunting and are described as very innocent people', ' However, these were replaced by the now migrating folks although till today the remains of these people can be traced on some parts of the mountain which indicates that some were integrated into the incoming migrants probably through marriage', ' It was historical unfortunate that the later visitors to the mountain thought the Chagga to be one tribe', ' Since they were referred to as the Chagga by the Swahili from the coast, other visitors to the mountain such as missionaries and explorers thought that the mountain was dwelt by one tribe called the Chagga', ' However, this was not the case', '   The people who migrated to the mountain came from completely diverse backgrounds', ' There were those who came from the Usambara mountains, who migrated to the west and some parts of the central area of the mountain, those who migrated from the Kamba origin, especially those who settled to the east of the mountain together with the Taita, and those who had the maasai and waarush background who initially settled in the lower plains of the mountain but slowly some moved up to settle in upper parts of the mountain', ' Different reasons contributed to the migration of these different groups to the mountain, some of them are: Fleeing from drought, famine or epidemics where they had lived', ' A search for a peaceful environment, fleeing from wars and insecurity as they saw the mountainous place to be safer than where they had been', ' A search for a more prosperous land, since the mountainous soil was very fertile with many streams of water and the weather was very promising for agricultural activities', ' Travellers and those who went to the mountain for various activities such as trade, but decided to remain there', '  All these reflect different backgrounds', ' Different backgrounds then mean different languages, cultures, skills and traditions although the fact that majority were of the Bantu origin, it accounted for the similarity of languages, cultures and traditions', ' Different groups came with different skills to the mountain like hunting, forging weapons, war skills, pot making, furrow making, making and collecting honey, etc', ' These various groups intermingled to some degree and their existence on the mountain is what formed what came to be known as Chagga complex', ' All these contributed to the high skills and the brightness that the Chagga people portrayed', '  Etymology of the land At this stage we will look at three important words in the Chagga history, chagga, kilimanjaro and moshi', ' Historian Mary K', ' Stahl and explorer Charles NewNew, Charles (1873)', ' Life, Wanderings and Labours in Eastern Africa', ' Royal Geographical Society: London', ' give their opinions as to the meanings of the first two words', ' The origin of the word Chagga (dschagga or jagga) is not very clear today', ' K', ' Stahl gives differing opinions as to its origin although one of her opinions seem to concur with Charles new\'s meaning of ""getting lost"" or ""to give farewell to someone who is about to take a journey that you are not sure if they will be back (as they may get lost forever)""', "" In earlier Swahili language this would have been called 'kuchaaga' meaning to say bye"", "" Today's Swahili is 'kuaga'"", "" Why the land was attached with the word 'to get lost'? This is where the stories begin"", ' It is claimed that the first coastal trade people to get into the land got lost due to the thick forests', ' As hypothesized by Stahl, it took them days to get their original route again and they thought that their getting lost was mysterious', ' When they went back to the coast they spread this news and the land was called Chaga (or Chagga) as a sign of getting lost', '  Another explanation of the origin of the word, which also missionary Charles New mentioned as he quoted rev', ' Johannine Rebmann, is that the word came out of a terrible event that befell on people', ' The years of the event are not known to us but it was a time when a powerful chief of Machame, Rengua, was ruling and at that time caravans from the coast had already started to get there to trade on ivory with the natives', ' Being constantly instigated by the Swahili people that what is on top of the mountain has to do with silver which promises much richness to his kingdom, Chief Rengua sent a large band of emissary to get as much silver as possible down to him', ' A caravan trader from the coast Bwana Heri who accompanied rev', ' Rebmann to the mountain told him that he actually saw one of the survivors of the tragedy who had become disabled due to freezing temperature as they went up the mountain', ' The rest of the envoy perished on the way', ' The story that survived was that on the mountain there is a spirit that will destroy anyone who would try to get close to it, and the Swahili who were at the court of Rengua, seeing the disaster that had befallen those who went up, spread news to the coast that anyone trying to get higher on the mountain will get lost as the mountain has the dreadful spirit', '  The land was called chaaga as commemoration of the tragedy', ' This story apart from being backed up by the people who were close to the event as recorded in the history books, also connects very well with stories that circulated in the coast when rev', ' Rebmann arrived there on his mission to the Chagga', ' On learning that Rebmann wanted to go to the land of Chagga, the Swahili sultan of Mombasa who was an Arab, warned him that the land is dangerous as there is a spirit on the mountain that destroys people and he might get lost when he tries to do so', "" He mentioned to Rebmann that the name of the spirit (as known in the coast) was 'ndscharo' and hence the mountain was called mountain of ndscharo (i"", 'e', ' kilimandscharo)', "" He could nearly stop Rebmann from going to the land of Chagga if it were not for Rebmann's persistence to go there"", "" However, it shows that earlier the people of Chagga were known as 'wakirima', i"", 'e', ' people of the mountain (kirima was an old Swahili word for a hill)', ' Where they lived was known as the land of Chagga (i', 'e', ' land of getting lost) although later on the name was attached to the people themselves', ""  Of importance however, is the way the name 'Moshi' became prominent among the people of the mountain and by the early 1900s it could almost be used synonymously with the name of the Chagga land"", ' Moshi was one of the chiefdoms in Chagga ruled by Rindi (1860–1890)', ' Before that time the name scarcely surfaced in history although it seemed to be a recognisable location of some prominence', ' For example, in 1849, Rev', ' Rebmann mentions a young man who had come all the way from Moshi to trade honey and milk with his men when they camped at Machame', ' He also records in his diary of trouble in Kirua caused by one Kirumi who was supported by allies from Moshi (where his mother came from) to overthrow his father Marengo', ' This happened when Rev', ' Rebmann and his men were still in Kilema', ' These instances are the first appearances of Moshi in historical records, and just after a decade, Von der Decken records Moshi as a recognisable chiefdom although still not attained some autonomy from Machame as he observed earlier', 'Theil, E', ', Band, Z', "" (1871) Baron Carl Claus von der Decken's Reisen in Ost-Afrika in den Jahren 1862 bis 1865"", ""  During Decken's visit to Chagga a young chief Rindi was ruling in Moshi"", ' With much witticism and intrigue, and under the regency of his mother Mamchaki,Hollis, C', ', Von der Decken', ' Tanganyika Notes Records, 1958', ' Rindi established his chiefdom from a place known as tsudunyi in early 1860 and using the location of his chiefdom as a strategic advantage, directed many caravan traders to the mountain into his land', ' With much ambitions to power he even sabotaged caravans which did not show intention to pass through his chiefdom and those explorers who asked for guidance to other chiefdoms he conspired with his men who misguided them and got them lost or back to his chiefdom', ' However, there are indications that during his early days in power he acquired support from Machame to cleverly establish his presence in the east', ' By the early 1870s he could declare to foreigners that the whole of Chagga was divided into two major powers; Machame under Ndesserua being the greatest in the West and himself an important chief in the east', ' He substantiated his claim by providing a letter to Charles New that granted him safe passage to every chiefdom he could visit to the east of Chagga', '  Having acquired autonomy from Machame through allied raids to the east of Chagga and as far as Usambara, with extraordinary diplomatic schemes, by 1870 he could direct to his capital, Moshi, most missionaries and explorers who started to flock into the Chagga', ' This seemingly well calculated generosity made his chiefdom extremely popular to the coast and to the Europeans', ' Apart from all these well learned visitors to his chiefdom, it was an explorer Sir Henry H', 'H', ' JohnstonJohnston, Sir H', 'H', ' (1886)', ' Kilimanjaro Expedition', ' London', ' in 1884 who attempted to work on the etymology of the land', "" He investigated the meaning of the word 'Moshi' and the answers he got from traditional elders and others was just the variant of its pronunciations, like 'mushi', or 'muschi', 'moschi' etc"", 'etc', ' One thing he was assured was that the name did not relate to the Swahili word for smoke, i', 'e', ' moshi, as Chagga had a different word for that', "" He therefore had to conclude that the word 'probably comes from one of the kichagga terms or word'"", "" It's amazing how at that time couldn't the people of Moshi know the origin of the word for their chiefdom? It is not clear when they told him it was 'mushi' if they meant name of people, a certain locality or another pronunciation"", ' However, a story that circulates now among the natives of the land (which is also repeated by Professor Isaria Kimambo and A', 'J', ' Temu in their bookKimambo, I', 'N', ' and Temu, A', 'J', ' 1971', ' A History of Tanzania', ' Heinemann Educational Publishers: Nairobi', "") is that the name Moshi is a modification of the name of a certain locality near that of Chief Rindi's boma (court), and that place was very popular at that time"", ' The place was known as Kimotchi which was a popular local market in the area', "" But the problem with this theory is how would a chief's neighbouring village become the name of his chiefdom and the transition from Kimotchi to Motchi (or Moshi) is not very clear"", "" Whatever the case is, the fact is that the meaning for the word 'Moshi' as used for Rindi's chiefdom is not clear to us today"", '  Machame as a political establishment  Original Name  M(a)shami Preceded by  Kikafu Basin Settlement                                                                                        Founded  Late 17th Century  The Ruling House  Mushi Royal Family Mushi/Kombe/Shangali Dynasty Traditional Salutation  Kafo Kombe Mushi!

made by hominins breaking open the bones for marrow, using tools to strip the meat, or by carnivores having gnawed the bones', ' Since several kinds of marks are present together, some archaeologists including Lewis Binford think that hominins scavenged the meat or marrow left over from carnivore kills', ' Others like Henry Bunn believe the hominins hunted and killed these animals, and carnivores later chewed the bones', ' This issue is still debated today, but archaeologist Pat Shipman provided evidence that scavenging was probably the more common practice; she published that the majority of carnivore teeth marks came before the cut marks', ' Another finding by Shipman at FLK-Zinj is that many of the wildebeest bones found there are over-represented by adult and male bones; and this may indicate that hominins were systematically hunting these animals as well as scavenging them', ' The issue of hunting versus gathering at Olduvai Gorge is still a controversial one', '  Hominid fossils

The ethnic categorization of the two was an imposed and an arbitrary construct based more on physical characteristics than ethnic background', ' However, the social differences between the Hutu and the Tusi have traditionally allowed the Tutsi, with a strong pastoralist tradition, to gain social, economic, and political ascendancy over the Hutu, who were primarily agriculturalists', ' The

carrying then-President Juvenal Habyarimana, and Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi was shot down, killing everyone on board', ' The Hutu held the RPF accountable and immediately began the genocide, targeted at both Tutsis and Hutu moderates', '  Most of the killing during the Rwandan genocide was carried out by the radical Hutu groups known as the Interahamwe and the Impuzamugambi', ' Radio broadcasts also were an integral part of the genocide, which further fueled the genocide by encouraging Hutu civilians to kill their Tutsi neighbours, labeled as ""cockroaches"" in need of extermination', ' Despite its colossal scale, particularly within such a short period of time, the genocide was carried out almost entirely by hand, usually with the utilization of machetes and clubs', ' Various atrocities committed include the rape of thousands of Tutsi women, as well as the dismemberment and disfigurement of victims', ' Frequently the killers were people the victims knew personally—neighbors, workmates, former friends, sometimes even relatives through marriage', ' At least 500,000 Tutsis were killed, and approximately 2 million refugees (mostly Hutus) left for refugee

Council called for an investigation of the events, and acted to establish an international criminal tribunal to prosecute those individuals most responsible for the genocide', ' Adopting Resolution

chief Sina) and Kilema"", ' The rapid and certain disintegration of its influence over other Chagga states after an atrocious attack and her subsequent subjugation by Sina of Kibosho in the mid-1889, led to a highly confined influence constrained between Machame itself and a neighbouring ward, Masama, where a frail sultan of Machame seemed to alternate in abode', ' Although by 1889 she was still estimated to comprise almost 20% of all the population of the Chagga, towards the end of the 19th Century Machame distinctly became a lowly chieftaincy still with claims of influence over Masama', '

of mount Kilimanjaro from Machame and the adventurous route to its peak has continued to be the source of tourist attraction to this once a giant African state', '  The name ""Machame"" therefore refers to an ethnic and linguistic group of people occupying this area historically as its homeland, as well as the specific location', '   Machame language  Although sometimes lumped with other Chaga

of the three divisions of the Chagga states by the British rule in 1946 with the recognition of Chief M', 'H', ' Abdiel Shangali of Machame as the divisional chief, could have been none other than tracing back the Chagga politics to its old pre-German colonial rule where the then King of Machame extended his influence', ' The Hai division comprised Chagga states from Siha in the Western-end of

the Chagga states from Weruweru river Eastwards"", ' It was therefore the formation of the Hai division in 1946 that brought back the influence of the Chief of Machame to the Eastern Chagga states beyond Weruweru river', ' However, the redefinition of Chagga politics revived by the formation of divisions by the British rule would soon escalate to set the Chagga politics into the edge, the saga of which is discussed later in this article', '  After Tanganyika independence in 1961, the provinces were abolished and local authorities redefined', ' The Hai division became Hai district which mainly included the Kilimanjaro area West of Weruweru river, hence, roughly comprising the old Chagga states once identified as the confederation under the ruler of Machame', ' In 2005, Siha became a new constituency separate from the Hai district', ' Today Machame-Masama form the Hai constituency separated by the Kikafu river, with Machame to its East and Masama to the West', "" Out of 10 wards

over again, a careful study of Chagga history and Machame in particular seems to amazingly confirm the theory of historic recurrence,G', 'W', ' Trompf, The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought, passim', ' where events repeat with patterns strikingly similar to what had happened before, even to the decisions made by authorities that have no clue to her historical past', '  Ever since

Several secondary, unpaved roads connect points within Machame', '  Machame is traversed by several rivers that flow year-round within deep gorges running down the slopes of Mt', ' Kilimanjaro', ' In addition to the natural rivers, there are systems of flumes for irrigation that pre-date the colonial era', ' Although major infrastructure project spread piped water through much of the area in the 1990s and later, the flumes are still used and maintained for agricultural irrigation', '  We will observe in this article that, although there is a particular location identified as Machame, due to historical reasons, the study will inevitably present Machame and Masama as a composite narrative and classical discourse as this seems to be the case ever since before Masama got that identity between 1860-1870', ' The presentation will alternate between the Machame as a confederation of Chagga states West of river Weruweru (by the 1860s), Machame as narrowly defining the Machame-Masama state by the end of the 1880s, and Machame as a location that bears that name (i', 'e', ' pre-1800 identity)', '   Economy and agricultural practices  The majority of residents of Machame, like in many other rural areas of Tanzania, earn a living through agriculture', ' The year-round temperate climate and fairly high humidity allow cultivation of a huge variety of crops', ' Since the colonial period, coffee has been an important cash crop for export; however, its prominence has decreased in recent decades', ' As noted by Mbonile, et al', ', declining prices for exports have influenced farmers to replace coffee with annual crops like tomatoes, of which the surplus may be sold and consumed regionally', ' The overall land-use pattern in Machame (and surrounding foothill areas of Mt', ' Kilimanjaro) have changed broadly over the past 120 years—even more dramatically in the post-independence period', ' Specifically, increasing agricultural planting in the bottom three of the five climatic zones of Kilimanjaro has reduced native vegetation', ' Agriculture in Machame fits generally into two modes: home gardens consisting of multipurpose trees interspersed with food crops near houses, and the ""shamba"" lands, or small fields, where food crops like maize, finger millet, and beans are grown', 'LUCID Working Paper #25, M', 'J', ' Mbonile, S', 'B', ' Misana, C', ' Sokoni', '

following Machame narrations, who are among the few Chagga families to recall the encounter with the earlier inhabitants on the mountain, it seems that the migration of the later people who came to be called the Chagga, started about 600 years ago', ' The Machame elders recall the encounter of their ancestors with the earlier settlers of the mountain whom they referred to as the Koningo (wataremba), meaning, the pigmies (or mbilikimo in Swahili)', '  Since very few other Chagga clans on the mountain can recall the existence of such people on the mountain, this can mean that the machame ancestors might have been one of the earliest immigrants of the later Chaggas on the mountain', ' They describe the koningo as the short people with big heads carrying hones wherever they went', ' The horns were used for blowing in case one fell down for another one to come and lift him/her up', ' They also used hones to notify others of an important issue that needed caution or assembling', ' They were skilled in hunting and are described as very innocent people', ' However, these were replaced by the now migrating folks although till today the remains of these people can be traced on some parts of the mountain which indicates that some were integrated into the incoming migrants probably through marriage', ' It was historical unfortunate that the later visitors to the mountain thought the Chagga to be one tribe', ' Since they were referred to as the Chagga by the Swahili from the coast, other visitors to the mountain such as missionaries and explorers thought that the mountain was dwelt by one tribe called the Chagga', ' However, this was not the case', '   The people who migrated to the mountain came from completely diverse backgrounds', ' There were those who came from the Usambara mountains, who migrated to the west and some parts of the central area of the mountain, those who migrated from the Kamba origin, especially those who settled to the east of the mountain together with the Taita, and those who had the maasai and waarush background who initially settled in the lower plains of the mountain but slowly some moved up to settle in upper parts of the mountain', ' Different reasons contributed to the migration of these different groups to the mountain, some of them are: Fleeing from drought, famine or epidemics where they had lived', ' A search for a peaceful environment, fleeing from wars and insecurity as they saw the mountainous place to be safer than where they had been', ' A search for a more prosperous land, since the mountainous soil was very fertile with many streams of water and the weather was very promising for agricultural activities', ' Travellers and those who went to the mountain for various activities such as trade, but decided to remain there', '  All these reflect different backgrounds', ' Different backgrounds then mean different languages, cultures, skills and traditions although the fact that majority were of the Bantu origin, it accounted for the similarity of languages, cultures and traditions', ' Different groups came with different skills to the mountain like hunting, forging weapons, war skills, pot making, furrow making, making and collecting honey, etc', ' These various groups intermingled to some degree and their existence on the mountain is what formed what came to be known as Chagga complex', ' All these contributed to the high skills and the brightness that the Chagga people portrayed', '  Etymology of the land At this stage we will look at three important words in the Chagga history, chagga, kilimanjaro and moshi', ' Historian Mary K', ' Stahl and explorer Charles NewNew, Charles (1873)', ' Life, Wanderings and Labours in Eastern Africa', ' Royal Geographical Society: London', ' give their opinions as to the meanings of the first two words', ' The origin of the word Chagga (dschagga or jagga) is not very clear today', ' K', ' Stahl gives differing opinions as to its origin although one of her opinions seem to concur with Charles new\'s meaning of ""getting lost"" or ""to give farewell to someone who is about to take a journey that you are not sure if they will be back (as they may get lost forever)""', "" In earlier Swahili language this would have been called 'kuchaaga' meaning to say bye"", "" Today's Swahili is 'kuaga'"", "" Why the land was attached with the word 'to get lost'? This is where the stories begin"", ' It is claimed that the first coastal trade people to get into the land got lost due to the thick forests', ' As hypothesized by Stahl, it took them days to get their original route again and they thought that their getting lost was mysterious', ' When they went back to the coast they spread this news and the land was called Chaga (or Chagga) as a sign of getting lost', '  Another explanation of the origin of the word, which also missionary Charles New mentioned as he quoted rev', ' Johannine Rebmann, is that the word came out of a terrible event that befell on people', ' The years of the event are not known to us but it was a time when a powerful chief of Machame, Rengua, was ruling and at that time caravans from the coast had already started to get there to trade on ivory with the natives', ' Being constantly instigated by the Swahili people that what is on top of the mountain has to do with silver which promises much richness to his kingdom, Chief Rengua sent a large band of emissary to get as much silver as possible down to him', ' A caravan trader from the coast Bwana Heri who accompanied rev', ' Rebmann to the mountain told him that he actually saw one of the survivors of the tragedy who had become disabled due to freezing temperature as they went up the mountain', ' The rest of the envoy perished on the way', ' The story that survived was that on the mountain there is a spirit that will destroy anyone who would try to get close to it, and the Swahili who were at the court of Rengua, seeing the disaster that had befallen those who went up, spread news to the coast that anyone trying to get higher on the mountain will get lost as the mountain has the dreadful spirit', '  The land was called chaaga as commemoration of the tragedy', ' This story apart from being backed up by the people who were close to the event as recorded in the history books, also connects very well with stories that circulated in the coast when rev', ' Rebmann arrived there on his mission to the Chagga', ' On learning that Rebmann wanted to go to the land of Chagga, the Swahili sultan of Mombasa who was an Arab, warned him that the land is dangerous as there is a spirit on the mountain that destroys people and he might get lost when he tries to do so', "" He mentioned to Rebmann that the name of the spirit (as known in the coast) was 'ndscharo' and hence the mountain was called mountain of ndscharo (i"", 'e', ' kilimandscharo)', "" He could nearly stop Rebmann from going to the land of Chagga if it were not for Rebmann's persistence to go there"", "" However, it shows that earlier the people of Chagga were known as 'wakirima', i"", 'e', ' people of the mountain (kirima was an old Swahili word for a hill)', ' Where they lived was known as the land of Chagga (i', 'e', ' land of getting lost) although later on the name was attached to the people themselves', ""  Of importance however, is the way the name 'Moshi' became prominent among the people of the mountain and by the early 1900s it could almost be used synonymously with the name of the Chagga land"", ' Moshi was one of the chiefdoms in Chagga ruled by Rindi (1860–1890)', ' Before that time the name scarcely surfaced in history although it seemed to be a recognisable location of some prominence', ' For example, in 1849, Rev', ' Rebmann mentions a young man who had come all the way from Moshi to trade honey and milk with his men when they camped at Machame', ' He also records in his diary of trouble in Kirua caused by one Kirumi who was supported by allies from Moshi (where his mother came from) to overthrow his father Marengo', ' This happened when Rev', ' Rebmann and his men were still in Kilema', ' These instances are the first appearances of Moshi in historical records, and just after a decade, Von der Decken records Moshi as a recognisable chiefdom although still not attained some autonomy from Machame as he observed earlier', 'Theil, E', ', Band, Z', "" (1871) Baron Carl Claus von der Decken's Reisen in Ost-Afrika in den Jahren 1862 bis 1865"", ""  During Decken's visit to Chagga a young chief Rindi was ruling in Moshi"", ' With much witticism and intrigue, and under the regency of his mother Mamchaki,Hollis, C', ', Von der Decken', ' Tanganyika Notes Records, 1958', ' Rindi established his chiefdom from a place known as tsudunyi in early 1860 and using the location of his chiefdom as a strategic advantage, directed many caravan traders to the mountain into his land', ' With much ambitions to power he even sabotaged caravans which did not show intention to pass through his chiefdom and those explorers who asked for guidance to other chiefdoms he conspired with his men who misguided them and got them lost or back to his chiefdom', ' However, there are indications that during his early days in power he acquired support from Machame to cleverly establish his presence in the east', ' By the early 1870s he could declare to foreigners that the whole of Chagga was divided into two major powers; Machame under Ndesserua being the greatest in the West and himself an important chief in the east', ' He substantiated his claim by providing a letter to Charles New that granted him safe passage to every chiefdom he could visit to the east of Chagga', '  Having acquired autonomy from Machame through allied raids to the east of Chagga and as far as Usambara, with extraordinary diplomatic schemes, by 1870 he could direct to his capital, Moshi, most missionaries and explorers who started to flock into the Chagga', ' This seemingly well calculated generosity made his chiefdom extremely popular to the coast and to the Europeans', ' Apart from all these well learned visitors to his chiefdom, it was an explorer Sir Henry H', 'H', ' JohnstonJohnston, Sir H', 'H', ' (1886)', ' Kilimanjaro Expedition', ' London', ' in 1884 who attempted to work on the etymology of the land', "" He investigated the meaning of the word 'Moshi' and the answers he got from traditional elders and others was just the variant of its pronunciations, like 'mushi', or 'muschi', 'moschi' etc"", 'etc', ' One thing he was assured was that the name did not relate to the Swahili word for smoke, i', 'e', ' moshi, as Chagga had a different word for that', "" He therefore had to conclude that the word 'probably comes from one of the kichagga terms or word'"", "" It's amazing how at that time couldn't the people of Moshi know the origin of the word for their chiefdom? It is not clear when they told him it was 'mushi' if they meant name of people, a certain locality or another pronunciation"", ' However, a story that circulates now among the natives of the land (which is also repeated by Professor Isaria Kimambo and A', 'J', ' Temu in their bookKimambo, I', 'N', ' and Temu, A', 'J', ' 1971', ' A History of Tanzania', ' Heinemann Educational Publishers: Nairobi', "") is that the name Moshi is a modification of the name of a certain locality near that of Chief Rindi's boma (court), and that place was very popular at that time"", ' The place was known as Kimotchi which was a popular local market in the area', "" But the problem with this theory is how would a chief's neighbouring village become the name of his chiefdom and the transition from Kimotchi to Motchi (or Moshi) is not very clear"", "" Whatever the case is, the fact is that the meaning for the word 'Moshi' as used for Rindi's chiefdom is not clear to us today"", '  Machame as a political establishment  Original Name  M(a)shami Preceded by  Kikafu Basin Settlement                                                                                        Founded  Late 17th Century  The Ruling House  Mushi Royal Family Mushi/Kombe/Shangali Dynasty Traditional Salutation  Kafo Kombe Mushi!

marrow and to chop tough  plant material', '  Bone fragments of birds, fish, amphibians, and large mammals were found at the FLK-Zinj site, many of which were scarred with marks', ' These likely were made by hominins breaking open the bones for marrow, using tools to strip the meat, or by carnivores having gnawed the bones', ' Since several kinds of marks are present together, some archaeologists including Lewis Binford think that hominins scavenged the meat or marrow left over from carnivore kills', ' Others like Henry Bunn believe the hominins hunted and killed these animals, and carnivores later chewed the bones', ' This issue is still debated today, but archaeologist Pat Shipman provided evidence that scavenging was probably the more common practice; she published that the majority of carnivore teeth marks came before the cut marks', ' Another finding by Shipman at FLK-Zinj is that many of the wildebeest bones found there are over-represented by adult and male bones; and this may indicate that hominins were systematically hunting these animals as well as scavenging them', ' The issue of hunting versus gathering at Olduvai Gorge is still a controversial one', '  Hominid fossils

[[File: Impressions of Rwanda by Jenny Paul – (20)', 'jpg|thumb|Photographs of genocide victims displayed at the Genocide Memorial Center in Kigali]] The tension between the majority Hutu and the minority Tutsi had developed over time but was particularly emphasized late in the nineteenth century and early in the twentieth century as a result of German and Belgian colonialism over Rwanda', ' The ethnic categorization of the two was an imposed and an arbitrary construct based more on physical characteristics than ethnic background', ' However, the social differences between the Hutu and the Tusi have traditionally allowed the Tutsi, with a strong pastoralist tradition, to gain social, economic, and political ascendancy over the Hutu, who were primarily agriculturalists', ' The distinction under colonial powers allowed Tutsis to establish ruling power until a Hutu revolution in 1959 abolished the Tutsi monarchy by 1961', '   The hostility between the two groups continued, as ""additional rounds of ethnic tension and violence flared periodically and led to mass killings of Tutsi in Rwanda, such as in 1963, 1967, and 1973""', ' The establishment of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and its invasion from Uganda furthered ethnic hatred', ' A ceasefire in these hostilities led to negotiations between the government and the RPF in 1992', '  On April 6, 1994, a plane carrying then-President Juvenal Habyarimana, and Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi was shot down, killing everyone on board', ' The Hutu held the RPF accountable and immediately began the genocide, targeted at both Tutsis and Hutu moderates', '  Most of the killing during the Rwandan genocide was carried out by the radical Hutu groups known as the Interahamwe and the Impuzamugambi', ' Radio broadcasts also were an integral part of the genocide, which further fueled the genocide by encouraging Hutu civilians to kill their Tutsi neighbours, labeled as ""cockroaches"" in need of extermination', ' Despite its colossal scale, particularly within such a short period of time, the genocide was carried out almost entirely by hand, usually with the utilization of machetes and clubs', ' Various atrocities committed include the rape of thousands of Tutsi women, as well as the dismemberment and disfigurement of victims', ' Frequently the killers were people the victims knew personally—neighbors, workmates, former friends, sometimes even relatives through marriage', ' At least 500,000 Tutsis were killed, and approximately 2 million refugees (mostly Hutus) left for refugee camps of neighboring Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda, and former Zaire', '  Establishment of the ICTR The United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda is regarded as a major failure', '""Rwanda/UN: Acknowledging Failure"", AfricaFocus Bulletin (compiling several individual reports),  March 31, 2004 The international response to the Rwandan genocide was poor', ' For weeks, the major power nations denied that a genocide was taking place in Rwanda', ' The United States refused to call the incident genocide because using the term would make an obligation for the United States to send troops, which it was reluctant to do after several of its soldiers were killed during a humanitarian mission in Somalia the previous year', ' Finally in July 1994, after the genocide was over, the UN Security Council called for an investigation of the events, and acted to establish an international criminal tribunal to prosecute those individuals most responsible for the genocide', ' Adopting Resolution 955, the Security Council created the ICTR on 8 November 1994 and the ICTR would also deal with other crimes against international humanitarian law committed on the territory of Rwanda and neighboring
