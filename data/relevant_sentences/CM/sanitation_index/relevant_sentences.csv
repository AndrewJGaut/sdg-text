immigrants allowed Fulbe communities to spring up in many areas', ' These early Fulbe converted to Islam sometime in the 17th century, beginning with the settled, or town, Fulbe', '  In 1804, Fulbe in the territory and beyond were growing disenchanted with submission to pagan tribes', ' They were also hungry for larger territories that they could use for cattle grazing', ' The Fulbe leader Usman

times', ' However, one event had drastic consequences for the region: the arrival of the Fulbe', '  Fulbe jihads  Early Fulbe settlers entered the Adamawa from present-day Nigeria or northern Cameroon as early as the 13th century', ' These settlers and nomads were never numerous, however, and they often held subservient status to other tribes', ' Over time, however, the steady stream of Fulbe immigrants allowed Fulbe communities to spring up in many areas', ' These early Fulbe converted to Islam sometime in the 17th century, beginning with the settled, or town, Fulbe', '  In 1804, Fulbe in the territory and beyond were growing disenchanted with submission to pagan tribes', ' They were also hungry for larger territories that they could use for cattle grazing', ' The Fulbe leader Usman

market', '  Those groups who resisted had no choice but to flee to the unforgiving mountains or else to the jungle south', "" Those groups who were immediate neighbours to the warring Fulbe, such as the Vute and Gbaya, dislodged others who lay in their path, such as Cameroon's Bantu peoples"", ' The Fulbe jihads thus served as the single most important event in the peopling of southern Cameroon', "" The jihad only served to depopulate Cameroon's north, however"", ' The Fulbe invaders did not set up new settlements', ' Rather, they used their conquered lands as pasture for their cattle', ""

administration  Germany's 1916 defeat in Africa in World War I eventually gave control of the territory to the French, the region's third occupying force in less than a century"", ' The new governors

the great work, one evening she went to the present site of the hospital and prayed to God for a hospital being built', ' At that time, the site was not yet chosen', ' The Sudan Mission had already issued in 1945 the idea of collaborating with the NMS and the Fraternal Lutheran Mission (MFL) north of Cameroon for the establishment of a hospital because they lacked the funds for the construction of a hospital', ' This hospital should be beneficial not only for the indigenous population but also for the care for the missionaries in the area', ' By this time, however, the government had begun construction of a hospital in Meiganga and would not consider building another hospital and the initial proposals were rejected due to strong opposition', ' In 1947, however, the NMS decided to send a doctor to aid the work of Endressen', ' Dr', ' Bernt Sigurd Bjaanes, a Norwegian who had arrived with his wife in Cameroon in December 1947', '  thumb|right|upright|European physicians in the hospital  In 1948 a new plan was presented by the Pastor Endressen Pastor and in June of that year John Fosse, a nurse and deacon arrived and three Cameroonian medical students were added to this team', ' One died and was replaced by another Cameroonian, Moussa Martin, and the three students would become part of the first class of nursing students in 1954', ' In 1949 the idea of the creation of the Ngaoundéré Protestant Hospital was already well advanced and the site that should accommodate the hospital was found', ' That same year, the Directorate of NMS sent a Norwegian architect Ove Aasen, to start construction work on the clinic of Dr', ' Bjaanes and the hospital', ' When Dr', ' Syrdal became Superintendent of the NMS he made a great effort to reach an agreement with the Sudan Mission to build a hospital in Ngaoundéré in the early 1950s', ' This reached a climax at a meeting on 2 February 1953 to clarify things', '  Following this development, it was now under consideration to finance the construction of the hospital', ' As stated above, the SM had already received enough money to build a hospital but this was not enough money to build a common hospital', ' In addition, the economic situation of the NMS became increasingly critical, which did not allow him to continue funding the construction of the hospital despite the fact that construction work had already started', ' On the proposal of Pastor Keller, secretary of the Mission, a request for assistance was sent to a French organization FIDES', ' A sum of 100 million francs had been requested, but only 2,882,000 francs have been achieved', ' FIDES were interested in particular in surgery and dentistry facilities but were not willing to finance the whole unit', ' By circumstance, a rich American named Young was in Cameroon and promised to contribute a sum of $ 25,000 enabling the construction of the hospital which would not only enabled full services to be provided but would finance the building of a school for nurses, and homes of the doctors and some nurses', ' In a letter dated 20 April 1954, Young also promised to pay the operating costs of the hospital for a minimum period of 5 years and a maximum period of 10 years', ' The generous donation was regarded by the missionaries as a gift from God enabling the creation of an advanced hospital in Ngaoundéré', '  Construction

of Fernando Pó', ' He established a factory in Concepción (now Riaba) and developed plantations of sugarcane', '  With the treaties of San Ildefonso in 1777 and El Pardo in 1778, during the reign of the Spanish King Charles III, the Portuguese gave to the Spanish the islands of Fernando Pó, Annobón, and the right to conduct trade in the mainland, an area of influence of approximately 800\xa0000 km2 in Africa, in exchange for the Colonia del Sacramento in Río de la Plata and the Santa Catalina Island off the Brazilian coast (occupied by the Spaniards)', ' The area stretched from the Niger Delta to the mouth of Ogüé River — in the current Gabon — and included, besides the islands of Fernando Pó and Annobón, the islets of Corisco and Elobeyes', ' Having failed its attempts to colonize these lands because they already had vast colonies in other parts of the world, Spain lost interest in Spanish Guinea in 1827 and authorized the British to use the island as a base for suppressing the slave trade', '  British presence In 1821, the British captain Nelly approached the island of Fernando Pó', ' He found it abandoned and founded the establishments of Melville Bay (now Riaba) and San Carlos (now Luba)', ' Some years later, another British captain, William Fitzwilliam Owen, decided to colonize the island and in the north of it — on the site of the present capital — erected a base for British ships hunting slave traders', ' Thus, on 25 December 1827, Port Clarence was founded on the ruins of a previous Portuguese settlement', 'The name was chosen in honor of the Duke of Clarence, who later became King William IV', ' The Bubis indigenous to the island called it Ripotó (place of the foreigners)', ' The population of the capital was increased by the arrival of slaves freed by the British', ' These freedmen were settled in Port Clarence before the establishment of Sierra Leone as a colony for freed slaves', ' The descendants of these freed slaves remained on the island', ' They joined other migrants who arrived as free workers from Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Benin, Nigeria and Cameroon, and became the population group called Creole or fernandinos, whose language was Pichinglis, a Bantu-English Creole with some Spanish elements', '  During the British period, the British consul automatically became the governor of the colony,

decade to implement this direct control', ' The capital already had more dynamic and Protestant religious missions which were very successful', ' Both factors helped to change the attitude of Spain, in addition to internal reasons already alluded', '  Spain again took control of the island in 1855 and the capital, Port Clarence, was renamed Santa Isabel, in honor of Queen Isabel II', 'The capital of the island of Fernando Pó became the capital of Equatorial Guinea', '  Its present name was given to the town in 1973 as part of the campaign of President Francisco Macías Nguema to replace place names of European origin with African names, in this case honoring Malabo Lopelo Melaka, the last Bubi king', ' Malabo, the son of King Moka, surrendered to the Spaniards', ' His uncle Sas Ebuera, head of the Bubi warriors, claimed to represent legitimate Bubi rule and continued resisting, confronting the Spanish openly in 1898', ' After the Spanish killed Sas Ebuera, Malabo became the king unopposed, but with no authority', ' Bubi clans and settlements were slow to accept Spanish sovereignty over the island, and the full conquest and pacification of the island was not achieved until 1912', '  Reign of Terror During the so-called Reign of Terror of Macías Nguema, the dictator suppressed much of the intelligentsia of the country, initiating the process of taking over the positions of the public administration by part of the natives of Mongomo and clan Esangui', ' Many city residents had to leave', ' In the last years of his mandate, almost a fifth of the population fled', ' At that time (1968–1979), Equatorial Guinea received money from the Soviet Union in return for, inter alia, affording port facilities for Soviet naval craft, particularly submarines', ""  The infamous

Grasses are the dominant form of plant life throughout except in the few forested areas and in some regions of scrubby bush', ' In addition, the southwestern half of the Mayo-Banyo division is a more heavily forested woodland savanna', '  The Adamawa has two national reserves', ' The first of these is the Parc National du Mbam et Djérem, which protects 4165\xa0km² in both the Adamawa and East

ideal for grazing"", ' Herdsmen rotate pastures, and they often construct watering holes or wells for themselves and their animals', ""  The close relationship between the Bororo and their herds lends a great cultural importance to a Fulbe's number of cattle, and the more heads of cattle a man has, the wealthier he is"", "" This often leads herders to never kill their animals, however, and to keep sick animals alive for fear of losing a portion of one's net worth"", ' Nevertheless, many Fulbe herders transport their cattle to the big markets of Yaoundé and Douala for sale (some make it as far as Gabon and Congo)', ' The major transhumance paths are in the western third of the province and at the border with Chad', '  Most of these animals are of the humpbacked zebu breed', ' Near Ngaoundéré and Banyo, these are called Fulani zebu, large and meaty animals with dark-brown hides and white spots', ' The nomadic Fulbe, on the other hand, herd Bororo zebu', ' These are leaner,

groundnuts', ""  The Gbaya, Mbum, and Dourou are the region's most prolific farmers, though even the herdsmen farm in the rainy season"", ' Farms are typically small plots that are cleared or burned out of the brush and then planted during the dry season', ' Crops grow during the rainy season, when they are harvested', ' Because the dry season is so long, crops must be preserved, so most are

' The southwestern Mayo-Banyo division also has some coffee plots', ' Other interests have established groundnut, millet, and wheat plantations in recent years', '  Industry  The Adamawa has a bit of industry, most located in the capital', "" Much of this is tied to the region's cattle-based economy"", ' For example, leatherworking is an important industry in Ngaoundéré, as evidenced by the

succumbed to illness herself and was forced to return to Norway, closing the clinic', ' Three years later, however, she returned in 1938 and resumed her activities', ' Desiring a hospital to undertake the great work, one evening she went to the present site of the hospital and prayed to God for a hospital being built', ' At that time, the site was not yet chosen', ' The Sudan Mission had already
