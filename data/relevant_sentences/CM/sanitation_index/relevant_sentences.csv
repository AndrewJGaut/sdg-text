The huge amount of water rising suddenly caused much turbulence in the water, spawning a wave of at least  that would scour the shore of one side. Estimates of the rate of carbon dioxide entering the lake suggested that outgassings could occur every 10–30 years, though a recent study shows  that release of water from the lake, caused by erosion of the natural barrier that keeps in the lake's water, could in turn reduce pressure on the lake's carbon dioxide and cause a gas escape much sooner. Engineers could also introduce a channel to allow excess water to drain; if the water level were lowered by about , the pressure on the wall would be reduced significantly.United nations report on the dam   Return of population Despite the risks from carbon dioxide and collapse of the lake's retaining wall, the area is being resettled."
