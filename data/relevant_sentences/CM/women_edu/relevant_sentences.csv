ideal for grazing"", ' Herdsmen rotate pastures, and they often construct watering holes or wells for themselves and their animals', ""  The close relationship between the Bororo and their herds lends a great cultural importance to a Fulbe's number of cattle, and the more heads of cattle a man has, the wealthier he is"", "" This often leads herders to never kill their animals, however, and to keep sick animals alive for fear of losing a portion of one's net worth"", ' Nevertheless, many Fulbe herders transport their cattle to the big markets of Yaoundé and Douala for sale (some make it as far as Gabon and Congo)', ' The major transhumance paths are in the western third of the province and at the border with Chad', '  Most of these animals are of the humpbacked zebu breed', ' Near

groundnuts', ""  The Gbaya, Mbum, and Dourou are the region's most prolific farmers, though even the herdsmen farm in the rainy season"", ' Farms are typically small plots that are cleared or burned out of the brush and then planted during the dry season', ' Crops grow during the rainy season, when they are harvested', ' Because the dry season is so long, crops must be preserved, so most are transformed into grain, which is pounded by hand with mortar and pestle', ""  Cash crops play a small role in the region's economy"", ' SODEBLE grows wheat on 100\xa0km² at Wassandé, near Ngaoundéré', ' The southwestern Mayo-Banyo division also has some coffee plots', ' Other interests have established groundnut, millet, and wheat plantations in recent years', '  Industry  The Adamawa has a bit of industry, most located in the capital', "" Much of this is tied to the region's cattle-based economy"", ' For example, leatherworking is an important industry in Ngaoundéré, as evidenced by the

population, the Adamawa holds little import to Cameroonian politicians', ' However, the Fulbe tribe is spread throughout the country, especially in the three northern provinces, and together they form

areas"", ' The Gotel and Mambila Mountains at the border with Nigeria are largely composed of granite, which gives way to crystalline and metamorphic rock such as mica, schists, and gneiss', ' These are often covered in volcanic basalt, a combination that dominates until the Faro River', ' East of this, granites once again prevail, though sedimentary rock forms the valley of the Mbéré River, and a zone of metamorphic rock surrounds this', ' The Lom River also rises in a region of metamorphic rock', ' Volcanic rock occurs in the northwest just east of the Gotel Mountains and northeast of Ngaoundéré, the provincial capital, along the border with the North Province', '  Soils are mostly made up of brown or brownish-red laterites, the result of the annual shift between dry and wet conditions and soil wash on the mountains', ' Iron and aluminium content is high, which causes hardpans, duracrust, or cuirasses to form near the surface due to oxidation', ' The soil of the Lom valley is a lightly evolved composition of raw materials, as is that directly northwest of the Mbakaou Reservoir and directly west of the Faro River', "" The extreme northwest of the province has ferruginous soil instead, and many of the province's mountains, including the Gotels and Mambilas, contain mixtures of several soil types"", '  Drainage  The Adamawa is sometimes dubbed the ""water tower"" of Cameroon, since a large number of the country\'s rivers rise in the area', ' All of these fall into a tropical regime, with a period of high water from May to September during the rainy season, and a period of low water – or even complete dryness – from October to April', ' Some of these are subject to seasonal flooding as well, such as the Djérem in the area of the Mbakaou Reservoir', "" The province's rivers fall into three different basins: those that ultimately flow into the Niger River, to Lake Chad, and to the Atlantic Ocean"", '  The Mayo Deo River rises in the Gotel Mountains and then flows into the North Province', ' The Faro River begins a short distance east of the Mayo Deo but follows a wide, arcing course east and north between the Vina division and the Faro and Deo division before entering the North Province (the two rivers eventually join)', '  Two major rivers lie in the Chad basin', ' The Mbéré rises north of the town of Meiganga and then flows northeast toward the border with the North Province and the Central Africa Republic', ' The headwaters of the Vina River flow just north of Ngaoundéré before the river enters the North Province', ' These two rivers eventually merge to form the Logone River', '  The Mbam, Kim, and Djérem are the major rivers of the Atlantic basin', ' The Mbam and Kim both rise in the southwest before flowing into the Centre Province', ' The Djérem forms in eastern and western branches, which converge at the Mbakaou Reservoir', ' The river then flows south into the East Province', ' Due to the reservoir (which holds two million cubic metres of water), the Djérem forms an important source of hydroelectric power for Cameroon', ' Finally, the Lom rises about 60\xa0km east of Meiganga before flowing south into the East Province', ' The Djérem eventually becomes the Sanaga River, and these other rivers ultimately empty into it', '  A long history of volcanism has also created a number of crater lakes in the province, the results of collapsed volcanoes filling with water', ' Among the most well known are Lakes Tison (Tyson, Tisson) and Mbalang near Ngaoundéré', '  Relief [[Image:Hills

(averaging about 1,100\xa0m) and stretches from Nigeria to the CAR', ' Altitude dips to as low of 500\xa0m in the Djérem and Mbéré valleys and at the border north of Ngaoundéré', ' The plateau continues to about 8 degrees north before descending to the Benué Depression in abrupt cliffs and active volcanoes (though this transitional zone is mostly in the North Province)', '  Faults also cut across the area, the major one being the Cameroon Fault, dating from the Cretaceous Period', ' The Mbang Mountains follow this fault in a rough cut toward the east', ' Other mountains dot the province, as well', ' The Mambilas stretch into the extreme southwest from Nigeria and the Northwest and West Provinces', ' The Gotels are north of these along the border with Nigeria', ' All of these mountains form part of the Cameroon Ridge', ' Tchabal Mbabo, in the Gotels, is the highest peak at 2,460\xa0m', ""  Climate  The province's high elevation lends it a relatively cool climate average between 22 and 25 degrees Celsius"", ' However, specific conditions vary between the South Cameroon and Adamawa Plateaus', ' The former experiences an equatorial climate of the Guinea type with four seasons: a long, dry period from December to May, a short, wet period from May to June, a short, dry season from July to October, and finally a long, wet season from October to November', '  The climate of the Adamawa Plateau is classified as tropical of the Sudan type', ' It has only two seasons; November begins the dry period, and April the wet', ' Rainfall here averages 900 to 1,500\xa0mm per year and decreases further north', ' May and June are the wettest, with occasional tornadoes; August is another rainfall peak', ' In addition, temperatures dip from November to January, as conditions similar to those that cause winter in temperate climes take at least a tentative hold', ' Temperatures rise due to the Harmattan beginning in January, reaching a high in April', '

experiences an equatorial climate of the Cameroon type', ' Rainfall is within 1,500 to 2,000\xa0mm with a long dry period followed by a long wet period', ""  Plant and animal life  The Adamawa's vegetation has been shaped greatly by man"", ' It was once highly forested, but repeated brush burning and cattle trampling have changed the terrain', "" In the south, this is Guinean savanna, a transitional zone between Cameroon's forested south and desert north"", ' On the plateau itself, the savanna continues, though it is less wooded', ' Grass cover is consistent and thick, and the original vegetation still survives in the river valleys', '  What few trees dot the landscape are evergreen and deciduous until about 1800\xa0m altitude, when ferns and bamboos become prevalent', ' Grasses are the dominant form of plant life throughout except in the few forested areas and in some regions of scrubby bush', ' In addition, the southwestern half of the Mayo-Banyo division is a more heavily forested woodland savanna', '  The Adamawa has two national reserves', ' The first of these is the Parc National du Mbam et Djérem, which protects 4165\xa0km² in both the Adamawa and East Provinces', ' The park is notable for containing both large tracts of savanna and forest', ' In addition, a small portion of the Parc National de Boumba Ndjida extends into the territory from the North Province', '  Demographics  Settlement patterns [[Image:Downtown Ngaoundere', 'jpg|thumb|Downtown Ngaoundéré]]  The Adamawa is sparsely populated', ' Large swathes of land are devoted almost entirely to the use of Fulbe cattle herders, this pasture punctuated only by occasional settlements', ' The Cameroonian government has made efforts to persuade Fulbe herdsmen to adopt sedentary ways, but the nomadic traditions show little signs of change', ' Because the savanna has been pushing south, however, there is now a substantial amount of immigration to the Centre and East Provinces', ""  Ngaoundéré is one of Cameroon's fastest growing cities due to its location at the terminus of Cameroon's north-south railroad"", ' The modern city is thus a sprawling mass of winding streets surrounding the traditional town', "" It is also a microcosm of the province's ethnic diversity, as representatives of most of the Adamawa's peoples can be found there"", '  The Mayo-Banyo division in the southwest has a slightly higher population density than the rest of the province, largely due to the highly concentrated Mambila and Konja of the Mambila Mountains and the Vute and Pere of the Gotel Mountains', '  The Pere are also known as the Kutin or Koutine, though this is in fact a highly derogatory term meaning ""dogs"" that was given to them by the Fulbe', ' The northern border also has a slightly higher population density than the Fulbe interior', ""  People thumb|left|Territories of ethnic groups of the Adamawa Province  Language provides the most convenient means of categorising the Adamawa's ethnic groups"", ' The greatest number of peoples speak various Southern Bantoid languages', "" These Bantoid peoples primarily occupy the province's western third, in the

the northern third of Mayo-Banyo division and along the west bank of the Meng River', ' The Vute live south of them on the Nigerian border and in a second population centre on the southwestern bank of the Mbarkaou Reservoir', ' The Mambila inhabit the southwestern border, and the Konja lie inland from them along the Banyo-Bankim road', "" The Tikar are at the province's southwestern corner, with territories extending into the neighbouring provinces"", '  Those peoples who speak Adamawa languages constitute the next major grouping', ' The Pere are farthest west of these, living in three main concentrations', "" The first is at the province's northwest, north of Mayo-Baleo town"", ' They have another centre at the village of Paro south of Tignère, and their third grouping on the Meng River', "" The Kali at the province's northeast, along the North Province border centred at Bélél"", ' The Mbum (Mboum) are the last group, occupying the town of Ngaoundal and its environs', ' East of Ngaoundéré are the Dii, who have larger territories in the North Province', '  As speakers of an Ubangi language, the Gbaya make up another important grouping', ' Their territory spans the whole of the Mbéré division as well as a small area at the southwest of the Vina division', ' They continue south into the East Province', ""  The Fulbe make up an estimated 60% of the Adamawa's population"", ' They are further subdivided into two subgroups: the sedentary, or town, Fulbe and the pastoral Fulbe, or Bororo', "" The sedentary Fulbe are more numerous and inhabit most of the province's major towns, including Banyo, Tibati, Tignère, and Ngaoundéré, the capital"", ' Over years of intermixing with native populations, they have come to physically resemble their Sudanese neighbours', ' The pastoral Fulbe create only temporary settlements, preferring instead to range across the province and beyond with large herds of cattle', ' These Fulbe are lighter skinned than their town brethren, tall and thin, with Arab-looking features', '  The Fulbe speak a Cameroonian dialect of the Senegambian language Fulfulde', ' Due to their historical hegemony of the territory, it also serves as a lingua franca', ' Other major languages include Bitare, Dii, Gbaya, Mambila, and Tikar', ' Most educated inhabitants also speak French', '  Religion  Islam is followed by many in Adamawa, especially among the Fulbe majority', ' Even among them, however, there is a noted difference between the sedentary Fulbe, who are more religious, and the nomadic Bororo, who are often only nominally Muslim', ' Christianity has made many inroads, though Christians are in a distinct minority', ' Many of the tribes retain animist, or ""pagan"", beliefs, particularly in the mountains near the Nigerian border', ""  Economy  Livestock  The Adamawa's economy is based almost entirely on one single thing: cattle, a Fulbe monopoly"", "" The region's low population, high humidity, and vast fields of grass make it ideal for grazing"", ' Herdsmen rotate pastures, and they often construct watering holes or wells for themselves and their animals', ""  The close relationship between the Bororo and their herds lends a great cultural importance to a Fulbe's number of cattle, and the more heads of cattle a man has, the wealthier he is"", "" This often leads herders to never kill their animals, however, and to keep sick animals alive for fear of losing a portion of one's net worth"", ' Nevertheless, many Fulbe herders transport their cattle to the big markets of Yaoundé and Douala for sale (some make it as far as Gabon and Congo)', ' The major transhumance paths are in the western third of the province and at the border with Chad', '  Most of these animals are of the humpbacked zebu breed', ' Near Ngaoundéré and Banyo, these are called Fulani zebu, large and meaty animals with dark-brown hides and white spots', ' The nomadic Fulbe, on the other hand, herd Bororo zebu', ' These are leaner, lighter-coloured beasts that are better able to travel long distances', '  The government-run Institut de Récherche Zootechniques (IZR) and SODEPA have established a handful of modern cattle ranches, as well', ' The major ones are near the villages of Laro, Wakwo and Ndokayo', ' Here, ranchers have bred new breeds of cattle by mixing native Fulbe animals with the American Brahmin', ' Government initiatives have also been instrumental in the eradication of the tsetse fly in the region', '  Many ranchers and Bororo also raise horses and donkeys', ' In addition, the Adamawa has more goats and sheep than any other province, as these can live even in the larger towns', ' Pigs, however, are much less common due to the prevalence of Islam in the region', '  Agriculture  Nearly all farming in the province is done at the sustenance level', ' Millet is the mainstay, though maize, and manioc are also important', ' Other crops, grown in smaller quantities, include cocoyams, yams, and groundnuts', ""  The Gbaya, Mbum, and Dourou are the region's most prolific farmers, though even the herdsmen farm in the rainy season"", ' Farms are typically small plots that are cleared or burned out of the brush and then planted during the dry season', ' Crops grow during the rainy season, when they are harvested', ' Because the dry season is so long, crops must be preserved, so most are transformed into grain, which is pounded by hand with mortar and pestle', ""  Cash crops play a small role in the region's economy"", ' SODEBLE grows wheat on 100\xa0km² at Wassandé, near Ngaoundéré', ' The southwestern Mayo-Banyo division also has some coffee plots', ' Other interests have established groundnut, millet, and wheat plantations in recent years', '  Industry  The Adamawa has a bit of industry, most located in the capital', "" Much of this is tied to the region's cattle-based economy"", ' For example, leatherworking is an important industry in Ngaoundéré, as evidenced by the Société des Tanneries et Peausseries du Cameroun (STPC) factory', ' Rubber, perfume, and dairy products are also processed in the capital', ' Handicrafts, including woodworking and mat weaving, form another sector', ' Tin is mined near Mayo Darlé and the Nigerian border and southwest of Banyo, and bauxite is mined near Ngaoundal and Minim-Martap', ' Mineral water is obtained at Doungué', '  Transport   Ngaoundéré is the gateway to the province, and it is most easily accessible from southern Cameroon via the ""Transcam II"" rail line', ' The trip takes between 12 and 30 hours, but the presence of couchettes makes the journey bearable for those who can afford them', ' Other passengers are crammed into all available seats, however, including those in the dining car', ' Due to the overcrowded conditions, thieves are another hazard', '  Road travel from the south is also possible, but this is limited to poor roads from the Centre Province or else a long detour through the East Province, where the roads are not much better', ' Roads within the Adamawa itself are mostly unpaved and are often in poor condition (particularly south of Ngaoundéré) due to little maintenance', ' The road north from Ngaoundéré into the North Province is paved, however, meaning that those traveling via train can continue to the North and Far North without too much discomfort', ' National Road 6 enters the province from Foumban in the West Province and continues on to Banyo, Tibati, and Meïganga', ' National Road 15 comes from Sangbé in the Centre Province to Tibati and on to Ngaoundéré', '

nobles every Friday and Sunday', ' The province also has numerous scenic destinations ranging from crater lakes to caves and waterfalls', ""  Administration and social conditions  What social inequalities exist in the Adamawa largely stem from the region's high level of cultural homogeneity"", ' Most people in the province are Muslim Fulbe, and those who are not often fall prey to racism and discrimination, especially in more rural areas', "" The Cameroonian government has made efforts to encourage the region's nomads to settle, but so far has made little progress"", '  With its low population, the Adamawa holds little import to Cameroonian politicians', ' However, the Fulbe tribe is spread throughout the country, especially in the three northern provinces, and together they form

neighborhoods', ' She taught in particular the prevention of certain diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, intestinal worms and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)', '  In 1935 however, she succumbed to illness herself and was forced to return to Norway, closing the clinic', ' Three years later, however, she returned in 1938 and resumed her activities', ' Desiring a hospital to undertake the great work, one evening she went to the present site of the hospital and prayed to God for a hospital being built', ' At that time, the site was not yet chosen', ' The Sudan Mission had already

of a hospital', ' This hospital should be beneficial not only for the indigenous population but also for the care for the missionaries in the area', ' By this time, however, the government had begun construction of a hospital in Meiganga and would not consider building another hospital and the initial proposals were rejected due to strong opposition', ' In 1947, however, the NMS decided to send a doctor to aid the work of Endressen', ' Dr', ' Bernt Sigurd Bjaanes, a Norwegian who had arrived with his wife in Cameroon in December 1947', '  thumb|right|upright|European physicians in the hospital

the construction of the hospital', ' As stated above, the SM had already received enough money to build a hospital but this was not enough money to build a common hospital', ' In addition, the economic situation of the NMS became increasingly critical, which did not allow him to continue funding the construction of the hospital despite the fact that construction work had already started', '
