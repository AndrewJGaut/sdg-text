The economic issues faced included the restoration of the mining industry to pre-war levels, then growing it further with the need for extra labour, the restoration of the Boers to their lands and increasing the agricultural output of those farms', ' The political issue faced depended on what side of politics one stood on', ' The existing British administrators under Alfred Milner wished to anglicise the population through two main means', ' One by increasing the English-speaking population of the Transvaal and the other by teaching the Boer children in English with very little Dutch used, followed by self-rule', "" The Transvaal Boers' political objectives were the restoration of self-rule in the colony and the political environment to be dominated by the Boers"", '   Repatriation and reconstruction  As the war ended the British were faced with a large proportion of Boer men as prisoners of war and their families in concentration camps', ' As the British followed a scorched earth policy in the Transvaal, Boer lands, stock and farms had been destroyed', '  At the conclusion of the war, it was necessary to reconstruct a ""government"" for the new colony and this was begun with the appointment of a Resident Magistrate in every district of the colony and became District Commissioners while an Assistant Magistrate carried out the legal and magisterial duties of the area', ' Roman-Dutch law was translated into English so the law courts could continue, with some old acts repealed and a considerable amount of new law promulgated by the authorities in

sanitary functions', ' Within fifteen months of the end of the war, the introduction of municipal government was introduced with preparations made for fair elections based on property valuation and the creation of voters rolls with registration process explained in English and Dutch', '  Economic issues The British administrators set out to place most Boer farmers back on their land by March 1903 with nineteen million pounds spent on war damages, grants and loans', ' The administrators reformed the state agricultural departments to modernise farming in the colony which resulted in a maize and beef surplus by 1908', ' They also attempted to solve the poor white problem by settling them as tenant farmers on state land but lack of capital and labour caused the scheme to fail', ' An attempt was made to place English settlers on farmland so as to anglicise the Transvaal and increase the English-speaking population but this failed too as the policy attracted too few settlers', '  By the end of 1901, gold mining finally resumed on the Rand around Johannesburg, having virtually stopped since 1899', ' Backed by the mining magnates and the British administrators, there was a need to restart the industry but labour was required', "" Just prior to the war, white miners wages were high and magnates weren't keen to increase the wages and since black miners wages had been reduced before the war and not increased, so black labour weren't interested in working the mines"", ' Unskilled white labour was ruled out as their wages would be too high for the work done, so the mining magnates and their Chamber of Mines in 1903, sought alternative labour in the form of cheap Chinese workers', ' The legislation to import Chinese labour was introduced to the Transvaal Legislative Council on 28 December 1903 by George Farrar and was debated for 30 hours and successfully voted on after its three readings on 30 December 1903, coming into law in February 1904', ' Having been

1907, South African gold mines represented thirty-two percent of the worlds gold output', ' By 1910, Chinese labour ended on the Witwatersrand and the restrictive job reservation laws preventing Chinese miners doing certain jobs was replicated for Black miners', '  Political issues  From the end of the war in 1902, the political administration of the Transvaal colony was controlled by members of a legislative and executive council, all appointed by the British Administrators under Alfred Milner and the Colonial Secretary in London', ' In 1903, three seats in the Transvaal Legislative council were offered to Louis Botha, Jan Smuts and Koos de la Rey, but they turned the British down', ' Due to a lack of a hearing given to the opinions of the Boer generals by the English administrators concerning Chinese mine labour, due to a belief they did not represent the Boer population, and the want of self-rule, garnered Louis Botha and others to meet in 1904 at a Volkskongres', ' The result of this people congress was the unification of the Boer political movement in the Transvaal into a new party called Het Volk in January 1905 by Louis Botha and Jan Smuts', "" This new party's objective was to seek reconciliation with Britain, which would be favoured by the British opposition Liberal Party, and Boer self-rule for the Transvaal"", '  English political movements included the Transvaal Responsible Government Association, the Transvaal Progressive Association and labour groups under an Industrial Labour Party', ' The Transvaal Responsible Government Association was formed in late 1904 by E', 'P Solomon and made up of loose gathering of ex-colonial and ZAR officials and diamond mining magnates, labour and businessmen', ' They called for the allowance of the colony to create its own policy and strive for self-government and the party would eventually be renamed the Nationalists', ' The Transvaal Progressive Association, formed in November 1904 and active from February 1905, had a similar membership but was linked to the mining industry opposed self-rule and preferred a legislature nominated by the High Commissioner with strong links to Britain', ' They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick', '  The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later in February 1907 an election was held with Het Volk running on two issues; Chinese labour needing to be ended when new labour sources were found and reconciliation with Britain with which they hoped would attract the English labourer vote as well as selling themselves as an alternative to the mining capitalistic Progressive Party', '   1907 election   The election was held on 20 February 1907 and

Witwatersrand with three independents aligning themselves with the party', ' The Progressive Party stood 34 candidates and won 21 seats, twenty on the Witwatersrand and one in Pretoria with five Randlords winning seats', ' Other parties included the Nationalists (old Transvaal Responsible Government Association) that won 6 seats, four on the Witwatersrand and two in Pretoria but their leader Richard Solomon failed to win his seat', '  The Transvaal Independent Labour Party won three seats in the Witwatersrand after contesting 14, but their leader Frederic Creswell failed to gain a seat',

Mines, Henry Charles Hull, Treasurer, Johann Rissik, Land and Native Affairs, Harry Solomon held Public Works and Edward Rooth as whip', ' The Progressives in opposition would be led by George Farrar and Abe Bailey as the opposition whip', ' They all assembled for the first time in March 1907', ' After the 1907 election, the issue of Chinese mining labour was revisited with Het Volk believing there was enough labour in the form of black and white miners', ' Taking into account the economic interests of the Transvaal, Botha ensured a gradual policy of repatriation of Chinese labour', '  By 1908, the Boers had won in elections, control of Natal, Orange River and Transvaal colonies, but under British influence with the need now to unite the country under one government', '   Progression to Union  [[File:Spelterini Transvaal', 'jpg|thumb|200px|Aerial photography of gold mines, taken by Eduard Spelterini in July 1911]] In May 1908, Jan Smuts, Transvaal Colonial Secretary proposed a gathering of representatives from all four colonies and decide on a customs and railways agreement and included a proposal that the colonies appoint delegates to discuss a constitution for a united country in the form of a National Convention', ' The objective of the convention was to find a solution to the political, racial and economic problems encountered by these colonies and find common ground between Boer and the English', ' On 12 October 1908, the thirty white delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers', ' Twelve delegates came from the Cape Colony, eight from the Transvaal and five each from the Orange River and Natal Colonies representing a gathering of sixteen from an English background and the remaining fourteen were of Boer origin', '  The main issues discussed was whether the four colonies would become a country made up of a union or a federation', ' Who would be allowed to vote and the number of voters who would make-up a constituency in a rural and urban seat', ' All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and Jan Smuts', ' On the question of black enfranchisement, the British government was prepared to accept the final wishes of the National Convention', ' The colonies of the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races', ' A compromise was reached and all the colonies wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement was accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament', ' As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents', ' This system for the constituencies would ensure that the Afrikaner would dominate politics in years to come and would be one of the many reasons why Jan Smuts would lose the 1948 election, sweeping D', 'F', ' Malan to power and the beginning of Apartheid', ' The results of the negotiations at the Convention became the draft South Africa Act which was released for viewing on 9 February 1909', ' By 19 August 1909, the South Africa Act passed through the Houses of Commons and into law', '  As to the question of black enfranchisement, the views of British and Boers were similar with Alfred Milner stating in a speech in 1903, that he believed in white superiority and thought the black man was not ready to rule and had similarly persuaded the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain to allow a future united white government to decide the question of the black franchise', '  Colonial Administration  Prior to the grant of responsible self-government on 6 December 1906, the Colony was administered by an Executive Council appointed by the Governor',

Republic (which had existed from 1856 to 1902)', 'Irish University Press Series: British Parliamentary Papers Colonies Africa, BPPCA Transvaal Vol 37 (1971) No 41 at 267 In 1910 the entire territory became the Transvaal Province of the Union of South Africa', '   History   Both the Boer republics, the South African Republic (ZAR) and the Orange Free State were defeated in the Anglo-Boer War and surrendered to the UK', ' The peace treaty (Treaty of Vereeniging) contained the following terms:  That all burghers of the ZAR and Orange Free State lay down their arms and accept King Edward VII as their sovereign', '  That all burghers outside the borders of the ZAR and Orange Free State, upon declaring their allegiance to the King, be transported back to their homes', '  That all burghers so surrendering will not be deprived of their property', '  No Civil or Criminal proceedings against burghers for acts of war, except Acts contrary to the usage of war', ' In such cases, there is to be

natives not be discussed until after self-government', '  That no special tax be introduced to cover the costs of the war', '  That various commissions be established to process and pay valid claims for war expenses and to honor script issued by the countries of the ZAR and Orange Free State during the period of the war', ' The commission would also feed the homeless and assist with the reconstruction of homes affected by the war', ' To that end, the crown agrees to a free grant of £3,000,000 as well as loans at no interest for two years to be repaid at 3 percent interest over years thereafter', '  In 1902, with peace following the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging, the new Transvaal colony was faced with intertwined economic and political issues that need to be resolved', ' The economic issues faced included the restoration of the mining industry to pre-war levels, then growing it further with the need for extra labour, the restoration of the Boers to their lands and increasing the agricultural output of those farms', ' The political issue faced depended on what side of politics one stood on', ' The existing British administrators under Alfred Milner wished to anglicise the population through two main means', ' One by increasing the English-speaking population of the Transvaal and the other by teaching the Boer children in English with very little Dutch used, followed by self-rule', "" The Transvaal Boers' political objectives were the restoration of self-rule in the colony and the political environment to be dominated by the Boers"", '   Repatriation and reconstruction  As the war ended the British were faced with a large proportion of Boer men as prisoners of war and their families in concentration camps', ' As the British followed a scorched earth policy in the Transvaal, Boer lands, stock and farms had been destroyed', '  At the conclusion of the war, it was necessary to reconstruct a ""government"" for the new colony and this was begun with the appointment of a Resident Magistrate in every district of the colony and became District Commissioners while an Assistant Magistrate carried out the legal and magisterial duties of the area', ' Roman-Dutch law was translated into English so the law courts could continue, with some old acts repealed and a considerable amount of new law promulgated by the authorities in Johannesburg', '  The Resident Magistrate then submitted the names of three members of the district to the Governor for district commission under the magistrate', ' They would consist of one British subject, and two Boers, one from those who had surrendered early on in the war and one who had fought until the end', ' The commission would have two functions, one to provide assistance and issuing of rations, equipment, transport and plough animals to those affected by the war, secondly to investigate claims for compensation for actual damages sustained during the war', '  Repatriation depots were established in the districts and they were stocked with food, seed, agricultural equipment, transport, plough animals and stone and building material', ' The rail transport network struggled to compete with the transport of army requirement to maintain a garrison and civilian requirements to repair the colony', ' All feed for transport animals had to be brought to the depots as the process started in the winter of 1902', ' Refugees from the concentration camps and prisoners of war were returned to their districts in a system of drafts', ' At the depots, they would receive farm equipment, tents and rations to start again and transport to their destinations', ' Food rations were provided for almost a year', ' Families would receive a token grant irrespective of their ability to pay it back and additional material and equipment required were obtained via interest-free loans with small cash loans also attracting no interest, with larger loans attracting four percent interest by a mortgage', ' The loan scheme was never going to compensate a person for the actual loss experienced by the war', ' Damage and the reconstruction required varied from district to district,  In the larger towns, municipal or health boards were ""appointed"" to manage them under the resident Magistrate', ' They had limited functions and the only rates they levied were for sanitary functions', ' Within fifteen months of the end of the war, the introduction of municipal government was introduced with preparations made for fair elections based on property valuation and the creation of voters rolls with registration process explained in English and Dutch', '  Economic issues The British administrators set out to place most Boer farmers back on their land by March 1903 with nineteen million pounds spent on war damages, grants and loans', ' The administrators reformed the state agricultural departments to modernise farming in the colony which resulted in a maize and beef surplus by 1908', ' They also attempted to solve the poor white problem by settling them as tenant farmers on state land but lack of capital and labour caused the scheme to fail', ' An attempt was made to place English settlers on farmland so as to anglicise the Transvaal and increase the English-speaking population but this failed too as the policy attracted too few settlers', '  By the end of 1901, gold mining finally resumed on the Rand around Johannesburg, having virtually stopped since 1899', ' Backed by the mining magnates and the British administrators, there was a need to restart the industry but labour was required', "" Just prior to the war, white miners wages were high and magnates weren't keen to increase the wages and since black miners wages had been reduced before the war and not increased, so black labour weren't interested in working the mines"", ' Unskilled white labour was ruled out as their wages would be too high for the work done, so the mining magnates and their Chamber of Mines in 1903, sought alternative labour in the form of cheap Chinese workers', ' The legislation to import Chinese labour was introduced to the Transvaal Legislative Council on 28 December 1903 by George Farrar and was debated for 30 hours and successfully voted on after its three readings on 30 December 1903, coming into law in February 1904', ' Having been rubber-stamped by the British and mining appointed Transvaal Legislative Council it outlined extremely restrictive employment contracts for the Chinese workers and the idea had been sold via a fear campaign aimed at white miners about the need for this labour or face the possibility of loss of mining and their jobs', ' By 1906, the gold mines of the Witwatersrand were in full production and by 1907, South African gold mines represented thirty-two percent of the worlds gold output', ' By 1910, Chinese labour ended on the Witwatersrand and the restrictive job reservation laws preventing Chinese miners doing certain jobs was replicated for Black miners', '  Political issues  From the end of the war in 1902, the political administration of the Transvaal colony was controlled by members of a legislative and executive council, all appointed by the British Administrators under Alfred Milner and the Colonial Secretary in London', ' In 1903, three seats in the Transvaal Legislative council were offered to Louis Botha, Jan Smuts and Koos de la Rey, but they turned the British down', ' Due to a lack of a hearing given to the opinions of the Boer generals by the English administrators concerning Chinese mine labour, due to a belief they did not represent the Boer population, and the want of self-rule, garnered Louis Botha and others to meet in 1904 at a Volkskongres', ' The result of this people congress was the unification of the Boer political movement in the Transvaal into a new party called Het Volk in January 1905 by Louis Botha and Jan Smuts', "" This new party's objective was to seek reconciliation with Britain, which would be favoured by the British opposition Liberal Party, and Boer self-rule for the Transvaal"", '  English political movements included the Transvaal Responsible Government Association, the Transvaal Progressive Association and labour groups under an Industrial Labour Party', ' The Transvaal Responsible Government Association was formed in late 1904 by E', 'P Solomon and made up of loose gathering of ex-colonial and ZAR officials and diamond mining magnates, labour and businessmen', ' They called for the allowance of the colony to create its own policy and strive for self-government and the party would eventually be renamed the Nationalists', ' The Transvaal Progressive Association, formed in November 1904 and active from February 1905, had a similar membership but was linked to the mining industry opposed self-rule and preferred a legislature nominated by the High Commissioner with strong links to Britain', ' They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick', '  The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later in February 1907 an election was held with Het Volk running on two issues; Chinese labour needing to be ended when new labour sources were found and reconciliation with Britain with which they hoped would attract the English labourer vote as well as selling themselves as an alternative to the mining capitalistic Progressive Party', '   1907 election   The election was held on 20 February 1907 and Het Volk won the election gathering 37 of 69 seats', ' It stood 43 candidates and won 34 seats outright, all the country seats were gained bar Barberton, three seats in Pretoria and four on the Witwatersrand with three independents aligning themselves with the party', ' The Progressive Party stood 34 candidates and won 21 seats, twenty on the Witwatersrand and one in Pretoria with five Randlords winning seats', ' Other parties included the Nationalists (old Transvaal Responsible Government Association) that won 6 seats, four on the Witwatersrand and two in Pretoria but their leader Richard Solomon failed to win his seat', '  The Transvaal Independent Labour Party won three seats in the Witwatersrand after contesting 14, but their leader Frederic Creswell failed to gain a seat', '  Louis Botha became Prime Minister of the Transvaal and Agriculture minister with Jan Smuts as its colonial secretary', ' Other new cabinet ministers included J de Villiers, Attorney-General and Mines, Henry Charles Hull, Treasurer, Johann Rissik, Land and Native Affairs, Harry Solomon held Public Works and Edward Rooth as whip', ' The Progressives in opposition would be led by George Farrar and Abe Bailey as the opposition whip', ' They all assembled for the first time in March 1907', ' After the 1907 election, the issue of Chinese mining labour was revisited with Het Volk believing there was enough labour in the form of black and white miners', ' Taking into account the economic interests of the Transvaal, Botha ensured a gradual policy of repatriation of Chinese labour', '  By 1908, the Boers had won in elections, control of Natal, Orange River and Transvaal colonies, but under British influence with the need now to unite the country under one government', '   Progression to Union  [[File:Spelterini Transvaal', 'jpg|thumb|200px|Aerial photography of gold mines, taken by Eduard Spelterini in July 1911]] In May 1908, Jan Smuts, Transvaal Colonial Secretary proposed a gathering of representatives from all four colonies and decide on a customs and railways agreement and included a proposal that the colonies appoint delegates to discuss a constitution for a united country in the form of a National Convention', ' The objective of the convention was to find a solution to the political, racial and economic problems encountered by these colonies and find common ground between Boer and the English', ' On 12 October 1908, the thirty white delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers', ' Twelve delegates came from the Cape Colony, eight from the Transvaal and five each from the Orange River and Natal Colonies representing a gathering of sixteen from an English background and the remaining fourteen were of Boer origin', '  The main issues discussed was whether the four colonies would become a country made up of a union or a federation', ' Who would be allowed to vote and the number of voters who would make-up a constituency in a rural and urban seat', ' All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and Jan Smuts', ' On the question of black enfranchisement, the British government was prepared to accept the final wishes of the National Convention', ' The colonies of the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races', ' A compromise was reached and all the colonies wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement was accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament', ' As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents', ' This system for the constituencies would ensure that the Afrikaner would dominate politics in years to come and would be one of the many reasons why Jan Smuts would lose the 1948 election, sweeping D', 'F', ' Malan to power and the beginning of Apartheid', ' The results of the negotiations at the Convention became the draft South Africa Act which was released for viewing on 9 February 1909', ' By 19 August 1909, the South Africa Act passed through the Houses of Commons and into law', '  As to the question of black enfranchisement, the views of British and Boers were similar with Alfred Milner stating in a speech in 1903, that he believed in white superiority and thought the black man was not ready to rule and had similarly persuaded the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain to allow a future united white government to decide the question of the black franchise', '  Colonial Administration  Prior to the grant of responsible self-government on 6 December 1906, the Colony was administered by an Executive Council appointed by the Governor',

administrators concerning Chinese mine labour, due to a belief they did not represent the Boer population, and the want of self-rule, garnered Louis Botha and others to meet in 1904 at a Volkskongres', ' The result of this people congress was the unification of the Boer political movement in the Transvaal into a new party called Het Volk in January 1905 by Louis Botha and Jan Smuts',

1904 and active from February 1905, had a similar membership but was linked to the mining industry opposed self-rule and preferred a legislature nominated by the High Commissioner with strong links to Britain', ' They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick', '  The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later in February 1907 an election was held with Het Volk running on two issues; Chinese labour needing to be ended when new labour sources were found and reconciliation with Britain with which they hoped would attract the English labourer vote as well as selling themselves as an alternative to the mining capitalistic Progressive Party', '   1907 election   The election was held on 20 February 1907 and Het Volk won the election gathering 37 of 69 seats', ' It stood 43 candidates and won 34 seats outright, all the country seats were gained bar Barberton, three seats in Pretoria and four on the Witwatersrand with three independents aligning themselves with the party', ' The Progressive Party stood 34 candidates and won 21 seats, twenty on the Witwatersrand and one in Pretoria with five Randlords winning seats', ' Other parties included the Nationalists (old Transvaal Responsible Government Association) that won 6 seats, four on the Witwatersrand and two in Pretoria but their leader Richard Solomon failed to win his seat', '  The Transvaal Independent Labour Party won three seats in the Witwatersrand after contesting 14, but their leader Frederic Creswell failed to gain a seat',

there was enough labour in the form of black and white miners', ' Taking into account the economic interests of the Transvaal, Botha ensured a gradual policy of repatriation of Chinese labour', '  By 1908, the Boers had won in elections, control of Natal, Orange River and Transvaal colonies, but under British influence with the need now to unite the country under one government', '   Progression to Union  [[File:Spelterini Transvaal', 'jpg|thumb|200px|Aerial photography of gold mines, taken by Eduard Spelterini in July 1911]] In May 1908, Jan Smuts, Transvaal Colonial Secretary proposed a gathering of representatives from all four colonies and decide on a customs and railways agreement and included a proposal that the colonies appoint delegates to discuss a constitution for a united country in the form of a National Convention', ' The objective of the convention was to find a solution to the political, racial and economic problems encountered by these colonies and find common ground between Boer and the English', ' On 12 October 1908, the thirty white delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers', ' Twelve delegates came from the Cape Colony, eight from the Transvaal and five each from the Orange River and Natal Colonies representing a gathering of sixteen from an English background and the remaining fourteen were of Boer origin', '  The main issues discussed was whether the four colonies would become a country made up of a union or a federation', ' Who would be allowed to vote and the number of voters who would make-up a constituency in a rural and urban seat', ' All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and Jan Smuts', ' On the question of black enfranchisement, the British government was prepared to accept the final wishes of the National Convention', ' The colonies of the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races', ' A compromise was reached and all the colonies wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement was accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament', ' As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents', ' This system for the constituencies would ensure that the Afrikaner would dominate politics in years to come and would be one of the many reasons why Jan Smuts would lose the 1948 election, sweeping D', 'F', ' Malan to power and the beginning of Apartheid', ' The results of the negotiations at the Convention became the draft South Africa Act which was released for viewing on 9 February 1909', ' By 19 August 1909, the South Africa Act passed through the Houses of Commons and into law', '  As to the question of black enfranchisement, the views of British and Boers were similar with Alfred Milner stating in a speech in 1903, that he believed in white superiority and thought the black man was not ready to rule and had similarly persuaded the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain to allow a future united white government to decide the question of

1904 and active from February 1905, had a similar membership but was linked to the mining industry opposed self-rule and preferred a legislature nominated by the High Commissioner with strong links to Britain', ' They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick', '  The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later in February 1907 an election was held with Het Volk running on two issues; Chinese labour needing to be ended when new labour sources were found and reconciliation with Britain with which they hoped would attract the English labourer vote as well as selling themselves as an alternative to the mining capitalistic Progressive Party', '   1907 election   The election was held on 20 February 1907 and Het Volk won the election gathering 37 of 69 seats', ' It stood 43 candidates and won 34 seats outright, all the country seats were gained bar Barberton, three seats in Pretoria and four on the Witwatersrand with three independents aligning themselves with the party', ' The Progressive Party stood 34 candidates and won 21 seats, twenty on the Witwatersrand and one in Pretoria with five Randlords winning seats', ' Other parties included the Nationalists (old Transvaal Responsible Government Association) that won 6 seats, four on the Witwatersrand and two in Pretoria but their leader Richard Solomon failed to win his seat', '  The Transvaal Independent Labour Party won three seats in the Witwatersrand after contesting 14, but their leader Frederic Creswell failed to gain a seat', '  Louis Botha became Prime Minister of the Transvaal and Agriculture minister with Jan Smuts as its colonial secretary', ' Other new cabinet ministers included J de Villiers, Attorney-General and Mines, Henry Charles Hull, Treasurer, Johann Rissik, Land and Native Affairs, Harry Solomon held Public Works and Edward Rooth as whip', ' The Progressives in opposition would be led by George Farrar and Abe Bailey as the opposition whip', ' They all assembled for the first time in March 1907', ' After the 1907 election, the issue of Chinese mining labour was revisited with Het Volk believing there was enough labour in the form of black and white miners', ' Taking into account the economic interests of the Transvaal, Botha ensured a gradual policy of repatriation of Chinese labour', '  By 1908, the Boers had won in elections, control of Natal, Orange River and Transvaal colonies, but under British influence with the need now to unite the country under one government', '   Progression to Union  [[File:Spelterini Transvaal', 'jpg|thumb|200px|Aerial photography of gold mines, taken by Eduard Spelterini in July 1911]] In May 1908, Jan Smuts, Transvaal Colonial Secretary proposed a gathering of representatives from all four colonies and decide on a customs and railways agreement and included a proposal that the colonies appoint delegates to discuss a constitution for a united country in the form of a National Convention', ' The objective of the convention was to find a solution to the political, racial and economic problems encountered by these colonies and find common ground between Boer and the English', ' On 12 October 1908, the thirty white delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers', ' Twelve delegates came from the Cape Colony, eight from the Transvaal and five each from the Orange River and Natal Colonies representing a gathering of sixteen from an English background and the remaining fourteen were of Boer origin', '  The main issues discussed was whether the four colonies would become a country made up of a union or a federation', ' Who would be allowed to vote and the number of voters who would make-up a constituency in a rural and urban seat', ' All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and Jan Smuts', ' On the question of black enfranchisement, the British government was prepared to accept the final wishes of the National Convention', ' The colonies of the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races', ' A compromise was reached and all the colonies wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement was accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament', ' As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents', ' This system for the constituencies would ensure that the Afrikaner would dominate politics in years to come and would be one of the many reasons why Jan Smuts would lose the 1948 election, sweeping D', 'F', ' Malan to power and the beginning of Apartheid', ' The results of the negotiations at the Convention became the draft South Africa Act which was released for viewing on 9 February 1909', ' By 19 August 1909, the South Africa Act passed through the Houses of Commons and into law', '  As to the question of black enfranchisement, the views of British and Boers were similar with Alfred Milner stating in a speech in 1903, that he believed in white superiority and thought the black man was not ready to rule and had similarly persuaded the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain to allow a future united white government to decide the question of the black franchise', '  Colonial Administration  Prior to the grant of responsible self-government on 6 December 1906, the Colony was administered by an Executive Council appointed by the Governor',

Free State during the period of the war.In 1902, with peace following the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging, the new Transvaal colony was faced with intertwined economic and political issues that need to be resolved.The economic issues faced included the restoration of the mining industry to pre-war levels, then growing it further with the need for extra labour, the restoration of the Boers to their lands and increasing the agricultural output of those farms.Families would receive a token grant irrespective of their ability to pay it back and additional material and equipment required were obtained via interest-free loans with small cash loans also attracting no interest, with larger loans attracting four percent interest by a mortgage.Within fifteen months of the end of the war, the introduction of municipal government was introduced with preparations made for fair elections based on property valuation and the creation of voters rolls with registration process explained in English and Dutch.Having been rubber-stamped by the British and mining appointed Transvaal Legislative Council it outlined extremely restrictive employment contracts for the Chinese workers and the idea had been sold via a fear campaign aimed at white miners about the need for this labour or face the possibility of loss of mining and their jobs.Taking into account the economic interests of the

Chelmsford believed that a force of over 4,000, including 2,000 British infantry armed with Martini–Henry rifles, as well as artillery, had more than sufficient firepower to overwhelm any attack by Zulus armed only with spears, cowhide shields and a few firearms such as Brown Bess muskets', "" Indeed, with a British force of this size, it was the logistical arrangements which occupied

fishpond are currently"", ' As a sculptor, I refuse to have the statue I love and care for so much be placed anywhere where its greatness would fall to the wayside', ' The center of Church Square is the designated place and there it must be built', '  In his other letter, Van Wouw claimed that Kruger himself had personally told the artist in the presence of several Volksraad members that it belonged at that location', '  Van Wouw\'s letter came to naught, and the issue was dropped until Gerard Moerdijk, architect of the Voortrekker Monument, suggested placing the statue near the southern

elect their own government', ' Kruger died in 1904, and the Transvaal Colony elected Botha, Commandant-General in the War and then leader of Het Volk, as its Prime Minister, a post in which he would continue from 1910 on for South Africa at large', "" Botha petitioned Kitchener to return the four sentinels and the panels to South Africa to accompany the statue in Church Square, but Kitchener

of them could find the missing statue', '  After two years of research, the City Council once again asked Marks if he could release the Kruger statue, still stored in Lourenço Marques, for construction; Marks insisted he would only do so when the Council agreed to complete the entire monument according to his initial design', "" The City Council decided to simply recast the missing Boers and panels on the advice of Fanie Eloff, who said it could be done for a mere £380, but while they appropriated £500 for Van Wouw's missing material, they found the plaster casts and sketches unavailable"", ' This left taking bronze casts of the English originals to reforge as the only remaining option, one beyond the means of the Council at an estimated cost of at least £1,760', "" Once again reaching out to Marks, the Council finally won his agreement to put Kruger up on the pedestal in Prince's Park"", '  On May 24, 1913, Victoria Day, Gen', ' Schalk Willem Burger, President while Kruger was in Europe from 1900 to 1902, unveiled the statue to the public', ' Both former Orange Free State President Martinus Theunis Steyn and Botha were absent, the former due to illness and the latter to attend to urgent parliamentary matters', ' The unveiling coincided with an agriculture fair and was attended by 3,000 citizens', ' At the ceremony, Burger expressed it hope that the statue would one day take its ""rightful place"" in Church Square, and Andries Daniël Wynand Wolmarans proclaimed that: ""I sincerely wish, from my heart and for my people, that this statue be moved to Church Square, to the center of the city, so it can take the place it deserves', ' There should also be an effort to bring back the missing pieces to South Africa, for one can only understand what Kruger means to his people when he is surrounded by sturdy Boers', '"" Botha contacted Kitchener once more to return the four other figures, to which he agreed to ""willingly"" return the two he owned ""to meet the wish of the people of South Africa,"" but only in return for copies; the two owned by the Royal Engineers were not his to return, but the Union of South Africa government was free to produce replicas of them at its own expense', '  Botha was willing to accept this arrangement, but at a cost of £520 per statue for a total of £2,080, he let the issue go', ' In 1917, Botha had to visit London briefly and was asked by the Mayor to try and secure the statues again, but Botha explained that he had been negotiating for four years in vain with Kitchener and did not wish to continue doing so', "" The Council once again sought Marks' help to no avail"", ' In August 1920, Edward P', ' Mathers, editor of the newspaper South Africa, began a press campaign to return the statue with the help of former President Francis William Reitz', ' Mathers discovered where the missing sculptures were, published the photos in his paper, and asked the Mayor of Chatham to pressure his City Council to help return the two figures there to South Africa, given that  ""as they remain at present they are a menace to the good relationships which I am sure Chatham as all England wishes to be established and preserved between them and the Dutch of South Africa', '"" Mathers also pointed out that South Africa and England had fought on the same side in World War I and that ""spoils of conquest"" from Afrikaners should be replaced with ""trophies of our enemies"" there', ' The Mayor of Chatham replied that the statues belonged not to the Council but to the Royal Engineers, who in turn said returning the artwork required the consent of the full membership', ' The officer corps there said that even though South Africa would volunteer to complete the task, they were unwilling to part with a memento of the ""brave and honourable men"" whom they fought against in 1899-1902 and fought alongside in 1914–1918; they also treasured the donation from the late Lord Kitchener (who had died in 1916), whom they held ""in special regard and honour', '"" Therefore, copies made at South Africa\'s expense were all the nation would get', '  While the public campaign to return the statue failed, Gen', ' Jan Smuts also put in his efforts', "" Succeeding Botha after the latter's death in 1919 as Prime Minister of the Union, Smuts was popular in Britain for his contributions to the war

Afrikaners' newly proven loyalty"", ' Milner contacted the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, the King, and the executors of the Kitchener estate', ' On January 18, 1921, Smuts received a telegram from Milner ""that His Majesty, the ""Colonel-in-Chief"" of the Royal Engineers, has agreed to donate the two Boer figures and the panels in Chatham as a gift to the Government of the Union of South Africa, and that Lord Kitchener\'s executors and His Majesty\'s Government will also provide the South African Government with the two other figures currently in Broome Park', '"" The Union had to pay

was missing was the monogram ""K,"" which was lost and never returned', '   The last struggle: 1925-1954  Assuming the monument would never be built, the Pretoria City Council authorized a World War I memorial on Church Square, but then Mayor of Pretoria George Brink responded to an August 13, 1920 protest from Mrs', ' H', "" Jooste (of the National Party Women's Auxiliary) by declaring that there would be no monument whatsoever there"", "" The memorial would be put in front of the Union Buildings and the Kruger statue on the square in front of the Pretoria railway station, on the same pedestal

gave the keynote address, but Gen', ' Smuts and Wolmarans both spoke as well', ' While Hertzog and Smuts concentrated on the subject\'s character and deeds, Wolmarans once more emphasized that Station Square could not hold a candle to Church Square, ""the heart of Kruger City,"" as a suitable place for the statue', '  Over the years, organizations such as the Federasie van Afrikaanse Kultuurvereniginge, the S', 'A', "" Vrouefederasie (South African Women's Federation]] and the Pretoria Cultural Council petitioned the City Council to move the statue to Church Square"", ' In fact, the Kruger Committee met with over 20,000 members in October 1936 to pressure the Mayor, but the Council was unmoved', "" The Cultural Council's Kruger Committee, chiefly tasked with holding the annual Kruger Festival, spun off on its own as the Kruger Society () with just such a relocation as the ultimate goal"", ' Enlisting the help of other Afrikaner cultural organizations, the Society used the centennial reenactment of the Great Trek in 1838 to kick off another advocacy campaign', ' The City Council fielded thousands of letters from various individuals and organizations, including branches of the Transvaal Education Association, the Organizing Committee of the Paardekraal Voortrekker Centennial Festival, the Carriage Reception Committee, and others; even Anglo groups such as the Sons of England, the New Guard, and the Hatfield Ratepayers Association joined the effort', ' The City Council stalled, hoping interest would flag, but on March 9, 1939, the Transvaal Provincial Council unanimously motioned for the City Council to solve the matter definitively, and on May 29, the majority of the latter agreed to relocate the statue at no cost to them', '  The Chairman of the Kruger Society and the Mayor of Pretoria made a joint appeal for citizen donations, earning £4,000 for the relocation', "" In consultation with Van Wouw, who had never preferred Marks's choice of pedestal, Kruger Society architect J"", ' M', ' van der Westhuizen planned a new base for the monument', "" Van Wouw's approval was followed by that of the full Society, which proceeded to arrange for an unveiling on Church Square on October 10, 1941, by Mrs"", ' Rachel Isabella Steyn, widow of the last President of the Orange Free State', ' At this point, the City Council declared the new pedestal architecturally out of step with Church Square, a matter probed by two architects (Gordon Leith and Vivian Sydney Rees-Poole) and their colleagues from the Kruger Society', ' It turned out that the Council preferred the southern entrance of the Square as a location for the statue, while the Society favored the center', "" Van Wouw took the Kruger Society's position in two firm letters stating:  It is my vision for the pedestal, the Boers, and the President's likeness to coexist as one unit, according to architect's plans in consultation with myself, on Church Square where the fountain and fishpond are currently"", ' As a sculptor, I refuse to have the statue I love and care for so much be placed anywhere where its greatness would fall to the wayside', ' The center of Church Square is the designated place and there it must be built', '  In his other letter, Van Wouw claimed that Kruger himself had personally told the artist in the presence of several Volksraad members that it belonged at that location', '  Van Wouw\'s letter came to naught, and the issue was dropped until Gerard Moerdijk, architect of the Voortrekker Monument, suggested placing the statue near the southern entrance to Church Square as the ""psychological center"" to what he envisioned as a kind of amphitheater, as the pulpit of a church would be', ' An honorary stele and bell tower would be built behind the statue, with the Boer figures on the sides rather than around the base of the Kruger statue', "" The Kruger Society approved the plan, while the City Council suggested an open national competition to gather architect's designs unifying the plaza around the statue, and asked for the Pretoria Institute for Architecture (PIA) and the Kruger Society's cooperation"", ' Both organizations agreed, the latter on the condition that a majority of the judges would have the final say on the chosen design, but the PIA by-laws prohibited its members from participating in outside competitions', '  At this point a new development emerged: Professor William Holford, Baron Holford proposed a plan to City Council for the overall development of the capital, including the Kruger statue in Church Square', "" The impressed Council scrapped all previous plans on September 28, 1950, enlisting the Kruger Society to raise the statue on the Square under the conditions of strict adherence to the Holford's plan and Council approval of the final product"", ' The cost and time requirements were quite unpopular, and oral agreements were not forthcoming: the Old Pretoria Society voiced its displeasure openly, and even the Kruger Society eventually rejected it', ""  On June 12, 1951, the Kruger Society decided to abandon Moerdijk's idea of placing the Kruger statue at the southern entrance of Church Square and return to advocating the central location, to which the statue was to be moved by October 10, 1954 (Kruger's birthday), or on December 16, 1954 (the 50th anniversary of Kruger's burial in the Pretoria Old Cemetery on Church Street"", ' Since Kruger dreamed of free passage to the east coast, the Society also decided the statue should face eastward from Church Square', ' Any changes City Council wanted to make could be introduced later, though the central position would stay', "" After the Council heard from a delegation of the Society, the former decided on December 20, 1951 to cancel their previous decisions and unanimously embrace the Society's position, on the condition of the Council incurring no costs and having final approval rights"", ' Permission was granted to the Society on November 26, 1952, once approval was gained from the Administrator of Transvaal Province, to begin the relocation', "" The Council was still bound to Kitchener's prohibition of statues

increasing the agricultural output of those farms', ' The political issue faced depended on what side of politics one stood on', ' The existing British administrators under Alfred Milner wished to anglicise the population through two main means', ' One by increasing the English-speaking population of the Transvaal and the other by teaching the Boer children in English with very little Dutch used, followed by self-rule', "" The Transvaal Boers' political objectives were the restoration of self-rule in the colony and the political environment to be dominated by the Boers"", '   Repatriation and reconstruction  As the war ended the British were faced with a large proportion of Boer men as prisoners of war and their families in concentration camps', ' As the British followed a scorched earth policy in the Transvaal, Boer lands, stock and farms had been destroyed', '  At the conclusion of the war, it was necessary to reconstruct a ""government"" for the new colony and this was begun with the appointment of a Resident Magistrate in every district of the colony and became District Commissioners while an Assistant Magistrate carried out the legal and magisterial duties of the area', ' Roman-Dutch law was translated into English so the law courts could continue, with some old acts repealed and a considerable amount of new law promulgated by the authorities in Johannesburg', '  The Resident Magistrate then submitted the names of three members of the district to the Governor for district commission under the magistrate', ' They would consist of one British subject, and two Boers, one from those who had surrendered early on in the war and one who had fought until the end', ' The commission would have two functions, one to provide assistance and issuing of rations, equipment, transport and plough animals to those affected by the war, secondly to investigate claims for compensation for actual damages sustained during the war', '  Repatriation depots were established in the districts and they were stocked with food, seed, agricultural equipment, transport, plough animals and stone and building material', ' The rail transport network struggled to compete with the transport of army requirement to maintain a garrison and civilian requirements to repair the colony', ' All feed for transport animals had to be brought to the depots as the process started in the winter of 1902', ' Refugees from the concentration camps and prisoners of war were returned to their districts in a system of drafts', ' At the depots, they would receive farm equipment, tents and rations to start again and transport to their destinations', ' Food rations were provided for almost a year', ' Families would receive a token grant irrespective of their ability to pay it back and additional material and equipment required were obtained via interest-free loans with small cash loans also attracting no interest, with larger loans attracting four percent interest by a mortgage', ' The loan scheme was never going to compensate a person for the actual loss experienced by the war', ' Damage and the reconstruction required varied from district to district,  In the larger towns, municipal or health boards were ""appointed"" to manage them under the resident Magistrate', ' They had limited functions and the only rates they levied were for sanitary functions', ' Within fifteen months of the end of the war, the introduction of municipal government was introduced with preparations made for fair elections based on property valuation and the creation of voters rolls with registration process explained in English and Dutch', '  Economic issues The British administrators set out to place most Boer farmers back on their land by March 1903 with nineteen million pounds spent on war damages, grants and loans', ' The administrators reformed the state agricultural departments to modernise farming in the colony which resulted in a maize and beef surplus by 1908', ' They also attempted to solve the poor white problem by settling them as tenant farmers on state land but lack of capital and labour caused the scheme to fail', ' An attempt was made to place English settlers on farmland so as to anglicise the Transvaal and increase the English-speaking population but this failed too as the policy attracted too few settlers', '  By the end of 1901, gold mining finally resumed on the Rand around Johannesburg, having virtually stopped since 1899', ' Backed by the mining magnates and the British administrators, there was a need to restart the industry but labour was required', "" Just prior to the war, white miners wages were high and magnates weren't keen to increase the wages and since black miners wages had been reduced before the war and not increased, so black labour weren't interested in working the mines"", ' Unskilled white labour was ruled out as their wages would be too high for the work done, so the mining magnates and their Chamber of Mines in 1903, sought alternative labour in the form of cheap Chinese workers', ' The legislation to import Chinese labour was introduced to the Transvaal Legislative Council on 28 December 1903 by George Farrar and was debated for 30 hours and successfully voted on after its three readings on 30 December 1903, coming into law in February 1904', ' Having been rubber-stamped by the British and mining appointed Transvaal Legislative Council it outlined extremely restrictive employment contracts for the Chinese workers and the idea had been sold via a fear campaign aimed at white miners about the need for this labour or face the possibility of loss of mining and their jobs', ' By 1906, the gold mines of the Witwatersrand were in full production and by 1907, South African gold mines represented thirty-two percent of the worlds gold output', ' By 1910, Chinese labour ended on the Witwatersrand and the restrictive job reservation laws preventing Chinese miners doing certain jobs was replicated for Black miners', '  Political issues  From the end of the war in 1902, the political administration of the Transvaal colony was controlled by members of a legislative and executive council, all appointed by the British Administrators under Alfred Milner and the Colonial Secretary in London', ' In 1903, three seats in the Transvaal Legislative council were offered to Louis Botha, Jan Smuts and Koos de la Rey, but they turned the British down', ' Due to a lack of a hearing given to the opinions of the Boer generals by the English administrators concerning Chinese mine labour, due to a belief they did not represent the Boer population, and the want of self-rule, garnered Louis Botha and others to meet in 1904 at a Volkskongres', ' The result of this people congress was the unification of the Boer political movement in the Transvaal into a new party called Het Volk in January 1905 by Louis Botha and Jan Smuts', "" This new party's objective was to seek reconciliation with Britain, which would be favoured by the British opposition Liberal Party, and Boer self-rule for the Transvaal"", '  English political movements included the Transvaal Responsible Government Association, the Transvaal Progressive Association and labour groups under an Industrial Labour Party', ' The Transvaal Responsible Government Association was formed in late 1904 by E', 'P Solomon and made up of loose gathering of ex-colonial and ZAR officials and diamond mining magnates, labour and businessmen', ' They called for the allowance of the colony to create its own policy and strive for self-government and the party would eventually be renamed the Nationalists', ' The Transvaal Progressive Association, formed in November 1904 and active from February 1905, had a similar membership but was linked to the mining industry opposed self-rule and preferred a legislature nominated by the High Commissioner with strong links to Britain', ' They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick', '  The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later in February 1907 an election was held with Het Volk running on two issues; Chinese labour needing to be ended when new labour sources were found and reconciliation with Britain with which they hoped would attract the English labourer vote as well as selling themselves as an alternative to the mining capitalistic Progressive Party', '   1907 election   The election was held on 20 February 1907 and Het Volk won the election gathering 37 of 69 seats', ' It stood 43 candidates and won 34 seats outright, all the country seats were gained bar Barberton, three seats in Pretoria and four on the Witwatersrand with three independents aligning themselves with the party', ' The Progressive Party stood 34 candidates and won 21 seats, twenty on the Witwatersrand and one in Pretoria with five Randlords winning seats', ' Other parties included the Nationalists (old Transvaal Responsible Government Association) that won 6 seats, four on the Witwatersrand and two in Pretoria but their leader Richard Solomon failed to win his seat', '  The Transvaal Independent Labour Party won three seats in the Witwatersrand after contesting 14, but their leader Frederic Creswell failed to gain a seat', '  Louis Botha became Prime Minister of the Transvaal and Agriculture minister with Jan Smuts as its colonial secretary', ' Other new cabinet ministers included J de Villiers, Attorney-General and Mines, Henry Charles Hull, Treasurer, Johann Rissik, Land and Native Affairs, Harry Solomon held Public Works and Edward Rooth as whip', ' The Progressives in opposition would be led by George Farrar and Abe Bailey as the opposition whip', ' They all assembled for the first time in March 1907', ' After the 1907 election, the issue of Chinese mining labour was revisited with Het Volk believing there was enough labour in the form of black and white miners', ' Taking into account the economic interests of the Transvaal, Botha ensured a gradual policy of repatriation of Chinese labour', '  By 1908, the Boers had won in elections, control of Natal, Orange River and Transvaal colonies, but under British influence with the need now to unite the country under one government', '   Progression to Union  [[File:Spelterini Transvaal', 'jpg|thumb|200px|Aerial photography of gold mines, taken by Eduard Spelterini in July 1911]] In May 1908, Jan Smuts, Transvaal Colonial Secretary proposed a gathering of representatives from all four colonies and decide on a customs and railways agreement and included a proposal that the colonies appoint delegates to discuss a constitution for a united country in the form of a National Convention', ' The objective of the convention was to find a solution to the political, racial and economic problems encountered by these colonies and find common ground between Boer and the English', ' On 12 October 1908, the thirty white delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers', ' Twelve delegates came from the Cape Colony, eight from the Transvaal and five each from the Orange River and Natal Colonies representing a gathering of sixteen from an English background and the remaining fourteen were of Boer origin', '  The main issues discussed was whether the four colonies would become a country made up of a union or a federation', ' Who would be allowed to vote and the number of voters who would make-up a constituency in a rural and urban seat', ' All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and Jan Smuts', ' On the question of black enfranchisement, the British government was prepared to accept the final wishes of the National Convention', ' The colonies of the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races', ' A compromise was reached and all the colonies wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement was accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament', ' As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents', ' This system for the constituencies would ensure that the Afrikaner would dominate politics in years to come and would be one of the many reasons why Jan Smuts would lose the 1948 election, sweeping D', 'F', ' Malan to power and the beginning of Apartheid', ' The results of the negotiations at the Convention became the draft South Africa Act which was released for viewing on 9 February 1909', ' By 19 August 1909, the South Africa Act passed through the Houses of Commons and into law', '  As to the question of black enfranchisement, the views of British and Boers were similar with Alfred Milner stating in a speech in 1903, that he believed in white superiority and thought the black man was not ready to rule and had similarly persuaded the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain to allow a future united white government to decide the question of the black franchise', '  Colonial Administration  Prior to the grant of responsible self-government on 6 December 1906, the Colony was administered by an Executive Council appointed by the Governor',

before the war and not increased, so black labour weren't interested in working the mines"", ' Unskilled white labour was ruled out as their wages would be too high for the work done, so the mining magnates and their Chamber of Mines in 1903, sought alternative labour in the form of cheap Chinese workers', ' The legislation to import Chinese labour was introduced to the Transvaal Legislative

council were offered to Louis Botha, Jan Smuts and Koos de la Rey, but they turned the British down', ' Due to a lack of a hearing given to the opinions of the Boer generals by the English administrators concerning Chinese mine labour, due to a belief they did not represent the Boer population, and the want of self-rule, garnered Louis Botha and others to meet in 1904 at a Volkskongres', ' The result of this people congress was the unification of the Boer political movement in the Transvaal into a new party called Het Volk in January 1905 by Louis Botha and Jan Smuts',

Association was formed in late 1904 by E', 'P Solomon and made up of loose gathering of ex-colonial and ZAR officials and diamond mining magnates, labour and businessmen', ' They called for the allowance of the colony to create its own policy and strive for self-government and the party would eventually be renamed the Nationalists', ' The Transvaal Progressive Association, formed in November 1904 and active from February 1905, had a similar membership but was linked to the mining industry opposed self-rule and preferred a legislature nominated by the High Commissioner with strong links to Britain', ' They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick', '  The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later in February 1907 an election was held with Het Volk running on two issues; Chinese labour needing to be ended when new labour sources were found and reconciliation with Britain with which they hoped would attract the English labourer vote as well as selling themselves as an alternative to the mining capitalistic Progressive Party', '   1907 election   The election was held on 20 February 1907 and

Richard Solomon failed to win his seat', '  The Transvaal Independent Labour Party won three seats in the Witwatersrand after contesting 14, but their leader Frederic Creswell failed to gain a seat',

and Abe Bailey as the opposition whip', ' They all assembled for the first time in March 1907', ' After the 1907 election, the issue of Chinese mining labour was revisited with Het Volk believing there was enough labour in the form of black and white miners', ' Taking into account the economic interests of the Transvaal, Botha ensured a gradual policy of repatriation of Chinese labour', '  By

country in the form of a National Convention', ' The objective of the convention was to find a solution to the political, racial and economic problems encountered by these colonies and find common ground between Boer and the English', ' On 12 October 1908, the thirty white delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers', ' Twelve delegates came from the Cape Colony, eight from the Transvaal and five each from the Orange River and Natal Colonies representing a gathering of sixteen from an English background and the remaining fourteen were of Boer origin', '  The main issues discussed was whether the four colonies would become a country made up of a union or a federation', ' Who would be allowed to vote and the number of voters who would make-up a constituency in a rural and urban seat', ' All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and Jan Smuts', ' On the question of black enfranchisement, the British government was prepared to accept the final wishes of the National Convention', ' The colonies of the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races', ' A compromise was reached and all the colonies wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement was accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament', ' As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents', ' This system for the constituencies would ensure that the Afrikaner would dominate politics in years to come and would be one of the many reasons why Jan Smuts would lose the 1948 election, sweeping D', 'F', ' Malan to power and the beginning of Apartheid', ' The results of the negotiations at the Convention became the draft South Africa Act which was released for viewing on 9 February 1909', ' By 19 August 1909, the South Africa Act passed through the Houses of Commons and into law', '  As to the question of black enfranchisement, the views of British and Boers were similar with Alfred Milner stating in a speech in 1903, that he believed in white superiority and thought the black man was not ready to rule and had similarly persuaded the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain to allow a future united white government to decide the question of

Chelmsford believed that a force of over 4,000, including 2,000 British infantry armed with Martini–Henry rifles, as well as artillery, had more than sufficient firepower to overwhelm any attack by Zulus armed only with spears, cowhide shields and a few firearms such as Brown Bess muskets', "" Indeed, with a British force of this size, it was the logistical arrangements which occupied

the designated place and there it must be built', '  In his other letter, Van Wouw claimed that Kruger himself had personally told the artist in the presence of several Volksraad members that it

Kruger was in Europe from 1900 to 1902, unveiled the statue to the public', ' Both former Orange Free State President Martinus Theunis Steyn and Botha were absent, the former due to illness and the latter to attend to urgent parliamentary matters', ' The unveiling coincided with an agriculture fair and was attended by 3,000 citizens', ' At the ceremony, Burger expressed it hope that the statue would one day take its ""rightful place"" in Church Square, and Andries Daniël Wynand Wolmarans proclaimed that: ""I sincerely wish, from my heart and for my people, that this statue be moved to

visit London briefly and was asked by the Mayor to try and secure the statues again, but Botha explained that he had been negotiating for four years in vain with Kitchener and did not wish to continue doing so', "" The Council once again sought Marks' help to no avail"", ' In August 1920, Edward P', ' Mathers, editor of the newspaper South Africa, began a press campaign to return the statue with the help of former President Francis William Reitz', ' Mathers discovered where the missing sculptures were, published the photos in his paper, and asked the Mayor of Chatham to pressure his City Council to help return the two figures there to South Africa, given that  ""as they remain at present they are a menace to the good relationships which I am sure Chatham as all England wishes to be established and preserved between them and the Dutch of South Africa', '"" Mathers also pointed out that South Africa and England had fought on the same side in World War I and that ""spoils of conquest"" from Afrikaners should be replaced with ""trophies of our enemies"" there', ' The Mayor of Chatham replied that the statues belonged not to the Council but to the Royal Engineers, who in turn said returning the artwork required the consent of the full membership', ' The officer corps there said that even though South Africa would volunteer to complete the task, they were unwilling to part with a memento of the ""brave and honourable men"" whom they fought against in 1899-1902 and fought alongside in 1914–1918; they also treasured the donation from the late Lord Kitchener (who had died in 1916), whom they held ""in special regard and honour', '"" Therefore, copies made at South Africa\'s expense were all the nation would get', '  While the public campaign to return the statue failed, Gen', ' Jan Smuts also put in his efforts', "" Succeeding Botha after the latter's death in 1919 as Prime Minister of the Union, Smuts was popular in Britain for his contributions to the war

annual Kruger Festival, spun off on its own as the Kruger Society () with just such a relocation as the ultimate goal"", ' Enlisting the help of other Afrikaner cultural organizations, the Society used the centennial reenactment of the Great Trek in 1838 to kick off another advocacy campaign', ' The City Council fielded thousands of letters from various individuals and organizations, including branches of the Transvaal Education Association, the Organizing Committee of the Paardekraal Voortrekker Centennial Festival, the Carriage Reception Committee, and others; even Anglo groups such as the Sons of England, the New Guard, and the Hatfield Ratepayers Association joined the effort', ' The City Council stalled, hoping interest would flag, but on March 9, 1939, the Transvaal Provincial Council unanimously motioned for the City Council to solve the matter definitively, and on May 29, the majority of the latter agreed to relocate the statue at no cost to them', '  The Chairman of the Kruger Society and the Mayor of Pretoria made a joint appeal for citizen donations, earning £4,000 for the relocation', "" In consultation with Van Wouw, who had never preferred Marks's choice of

an unveiling on Church Square on October 10, 1941, by Mrs"", ' Rachel Isabella Steyn, widow of the last President of the Orange Free State', ' At this point, the City Council declared the new pedestal architecturally out of step with Church Square, a matter probed by two architects (Gordon Leith and Vivian Sydney Rees-Poole) and their colleagues from the Kruger Society', ' It turned out that the Council preferred the southern entrance of the Square as a location for the statue, while the Society favored the center', "" Van Wouw took the Kruger Society's position in two firm letters stating:  It is my vision for the pedestal, the Boers, and the President's likeness to coexist as one unit, according to architect's plans in consultation with myself, on Church Square where the fountain and fishpond are currently"", ' As a sculptor, I refuse to have the statue I love and care for so much be placed anywhere where its greatness would fall to the wayside', ' The center of Church Square is the designated place and there it must be built', '  In his other letter, Van Wouw claimed that Kruger himself had personally told the artist in the presence of several Volksraad members that it belonged at that location', '  Van Wouw\'s letter came to naught, and the issue was dropped until Gerard Moerdijk, architect of the Voortrekker Monument, suggested placing the statue near the southern entrance to Church Square as the ""psychological center"" to what he envisioned as a kind of amphitheater, as the pulpit of a church would be', ' An honorary stele and bell tower would be built behind the statue, with the Boer figures on the sides rather than around the base of the Kruger statue', "" The Kruger Society approved the plan, while the City Council suggested an open national competition to gather architect's designs unifying the plaza around the statue, and asked for the Pretoria Institute for Architecture (PIA) and the Kruger Society's cooperation"", ' Both organizations agreed, the latter on the condition that a majority of the judges would have the final say on the chosen design, but the PIA by-laws prohibited its members from participating in outside competitions', '  At this point a new development emerged: Professor William Holford, Baron Holford proposed a plan to City Council for the overall development of the capital, including the Kruger statue in Church Square', "" The impressed Council scrapped all previous plans on September 28, 1950, enlisting the Kruger Society to raise the statue on the Square under the conditions of strict adherence to the Holford's plan and Council approval of the final product"", ' The cost and time requirements were quite unpopular, and oral agreements were not forthcoming: the Old Pretoria Society voiced its displeasure openly, and even the Kruger Society eventually rejected it', ""  On June 12, 1951, the Kruger Society decided to abandon Moerdijk's idea of placing the Kruger statue at the southern entrance of Church Square

Pretoria Old Cemetery on Church Street"", ' Since Kruger dreamed of free passage to the east coast, the Society also decided the statue should face eastward from Church Square', ' Any changes City

cancel their previous decisions and unanimously embrace the Society's position, on the condition of the Council incurring no costs and having final approval rights"", ' Permission was granted to the

Chelmsford believed that a force of over 4,000, including 2,000 British infantry armed with Martini–Henry rifles, as well as artillery, had more than sufficient firepower to overwhelm any attack by Zulus armed only with spears, cowhide shields and a few firearms such as Brown Bess muskets', "" Indeed, with a British force of this size, it was the logistical arrangements which occupied

1903 with nineteen million pounds spent on war damages, grants and loans', ' The administrators reformed the state agricultural departments to modernise farming in the colony which resulted in a maize and beef surplus by 1908', ' They also attempted to solve the poor white problem by settling them as tenant farmers on state land but lack of capital and labour caused the scheme to fail', ' An

to restart the industry but labour was required', "" Just prior to the war, white miners wages were high and magnates weren't keen to increase the wages and since black miners wages had been reduced before the war and not increased, so black labour weren't interested in working the mines"", ' Unskilled white labour was ruled out as their wages would be too high for the work done, so the mining magnates and their Chamber of Mines in 1903, sought alternative labour in the form of cheap Chinese workers', ' The legislation to import Chinese labour was introduced to the Transvaal Legislative Council on 28 December 1903 by George Farrar and was debated for 30 hours and successfully voted on after its three readings on 30 December 1903, coming into law in February 1904', ' Having been rubber-stamped by the British and mining appointed Transvaal Legislative Council it outlined extremely restrictive employment contracts for the Chinese workers and the idea had been sold via a fear

1907, South African gold mines represented thirty-two percent of the worlds gold output', ' By 1910, Chinese labour ended on the Witwatersrand and the restrictive job reservation laws preventing Chinese miners doing certain jobs was replicated for Black miners', '  Political issues  From the end of the war in 1902, the political administration of the Transvaal colony was controlled by members of a legislative and executive council, all appointed by the British Administrators under Alfred Milner and the Colonial Secretary in London', ' In 1903, three seats in the Transvaal Legislative council were offered to Louis Botha, Jan Smuts and Koos de la Rey, but they turned the British down', ' Due to a lack of a hearing given to the opinions of the Boer generals by the English administrators concerning Chinese mine labour, due to a belief they did not represent the Boer population, and the want of self-rule, garnered Louis Botha and others to meet in 1904 at a Volkskongres', ' The result of this people congress was the unification of the Boer political movement in the Transvaal into a new party called Het Volk in January 1905 by Louis Botha and Jan Smuts', "" This new party's objective was to seek reconciliation with Britain, which would be favoured by the British opposition Liberal Party, and Boer self-rule for the Transvaal"", '  English political movements included the Transvaal Responsible Government Association, the Transvaal Progressive Association and labour groups under an Industrial Labour Party', ' The Transvaal Responsible Government Association was formed in late 1904 by E', 'P Solomon and made up of loose gathering of ex-colonial and ZAR officials and diamond mining magnates, labour and businessmen', ' They called for the allowance of the colony to create its own policy and strive for self-government and the party would eventually be renamed the Nationalists', ' The Transvaal Progressive Association, formed in November 1904 and active from February 1905, had a similar membership but was linked to the mining industry opposed self-rule and preferred a legislature nominated by the High Commissioner with strong links to Britain', ' They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick', '  The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later in February 1907 an election was held with Het Volk running on two issues; Chinese labour needing to be ended when new labour sources were found and reconciliation with Britain with which they hoped would attract the English labourer vote as well as selling themselves as an alternative to the mining capitalistic Progressive Party', '   1907 election   The election was held on 20 February 1907 and

Witwatersrand with three independents aligning themselves with the party', ' The Progressive Party stood 34 candidates and won 21 seats, twenty on the Witwatersrand and one in Pretoria with five

Richard Solomon failed to win his seat', '  The Transvaal Independent Labour Party won three seats in the Witwatersrand after contesting 14, but their leader Frederic Creswell failed to gain a seat',

Mines, Henry Charles Hull, Treasurer, Johann Rissik, Land and Native Affairs, Harry Solomon held Public Works and Edward Rooth as whip', ' The Progressives in opposition would be led by George Farrar and Abe Bailey as the opposition whip', ' They all assembled for the first time in March 1907', ' After the 1907 election, the issue of Chinese mining labour was revisited with Het Volk believing there was enough labour in the form of black and white miners', ' Taking into account the economic interests of the Transvaal, Botha ensured a gradual policy of repatriation of Chinese labour', '  By 1908, the Boers had won in elections, control of Natal, Orange River and Transvaal colonies, but under British influence with the need now to unite the country under one government', '   Progression

country in the form of a National Convention', ' The objective of the convention was to find a solution to the political, racial and economic problems encountered by these colonies and find common ground between Boer and the English', ' On 12 October 1908, the thirty white delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers', ' Twelve delegates came from

obtained via interest-free loans with small cash loans also attracting no interest, with larger loans attracting four percent interest by a mortgage.Within fifteen months of the end of the war, the introduction of municipal government was introduced with preparations made for fair elections based on property valuation and the creation of voters rolls with registration process explained in

1903 with nineteen million pounds spent on war damages, grants and loans', ' The administrators reformed the state agricultural departments to modernise farming in the colony which resulted in a maize and beef surplus by 1908', ' They also attempted to solve the poor white problem by settling them as tenant farmers on state land but lack of capital and labour caused the scheme to fail', ' An attempt was made to place English settlers on farmland so as to anglicise the Transvaal and increase the English-speaking population but this failed too as the policy attracted too few settlers', '  By the end of 1901, gold mining finally resumed on the Rand around Johannesburg, having virtually stopped since 1899', ' Backed by the mining magnates and the British administrators, there was a need to restart the industry but labour was required', "" Just prior to the war, white miners wages were high and magnates weren't keen to increase the wages and since black miners wages had been reduced before the war and not increased, so black labour weren't interested in working the mines"", ' Unskilled white labour was ruled out as their wages would be too high for the work done, so the mining magnates and their Chamber of Mines in 1903, sought alternative labour in the form of cheap Chinese workers', ' The legislation to import Chinese labour was introduced to the Transvaal Legislative Council on 28 December 1903 by George Farrar and was debated for 30 hours and successfully voted on after its three readings on 30 December 1903, coming into law in February 1904', ' Having been rubber-stamped by the British and mining appointed Transvaal Legislative Council it outlined extremely restrictive employment contracts for the Chinese workers and the idea had been sold via a fear campaign aimed at white miners about the need for this labour or face the possibility of loss of mining and their jobs', ' By 1906, the gold mines of the Witwatersrand were in full production and by 1907, South African gold mines represented thirty-two percent of the worlds gold output', ' By 1910, Chinese labour ended on the Witwatersrand and the restrictive job reservation laws preventing Chinese miners doing certain jobs was replicated for Black miners', '  Political issues  From the end of the war in 1902, the political administration of the Transvaal colony was controlled by members of a legislative and executive council, all appointed by the British Administrators under Alfred Milner and the Colonial Secretary in London', ' In 1903, three seats in the Transvaal Legislative council were offered to Louis Botha, Jan Smuts and Koos de la Rey, but they turned the British down', ' Due to a lack of a hearing given to the opinions of the Boer generals by the English administrators concerning Chinese mine labour, due to a belief they did not represent the Boer population, and the want of self-rule, garnered Louis Botha and others to meet in 1904 at a Volkskongres', ' The result of this people congress was the unification of the Boer political movement in the Transvaal into a new party called Het Volk in January 1905 by Louis Botha and Jan Smuts', "" This new party's objective was to seek reconciliation with Britain, which would be favoured by the British opposition Liberal Party, and Boer self-rule for the Transvaal"", '  English political movements included the Transvaal Responsible Government Association, the Transvaal Progressive Association and labour groups under an Industrial Labour Party', ' The Transvaal Responsible Government Association was formed in late 1904 by E', 'P Solomon and made up of loose gathering of ex-colonial and ZAR officials and diamond mining magnates, labour and businessmen', ' They called for the allowance of the colony to create its own policy and strive for self-government and the party would eventually be renamed the Nationalists', ' The Transvaal Progressive Association, formed in November 1904 and active from February 1905, had a similar membership but was linked to the mining industry opposed self-rule and preferred a legislature nominated by the High Commissioner with strong links to Britain', ' They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick', '  The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later in February 1907 an election was held with Het Volk running on two issues; Chinese labour needing to be ended when new labour sources were found and reconciliation with Britain with which they hoped would attract the English labourer vote as well as selling themselves as an alternative to the mining capitalistic Progressive Party', '   1907 election   The election was held on 20 February 1907 and Het Volk won the election gathering 37 of 69 seats', ' It stood 43 candidates and won 34 seats outright, all the country seats were gained bar Barberton, three seats in Pretoria and four on the Witwatersrand with three independents aligning themselves with the party', ' The Progressive Party stood 34 candidates and won 21 seats, twenty on the Witwatersrand and one in Pretoria with five Randlords winning seats', ' Other parties included the Nationalists (old Transvaal Responsible Government Association) that won 6 seats, four on the Witwatersrand and two in Pretoria but their leader Richard Solomon failed to win his seat', '  The Transvaal Independent Labour Party won three seats in the Witwatersrand after contesting 14, but their leader Frederic Creswell failed to gain a seat', '  Louis Botha became Prime Minister of the Transvaal and Agriculture minister with Jan Smuts as its colonial secretary', ' Other new cabinet ministers included J de Villiers, Attorney-General and Mines, Henry Charles Hull, Treasurer, Johann Rissik, Land and Native Affairs, Harry Solomon held Public Works and Edward Rooth as whip', ' The Progressives in opposition would be led by George Farrar and Abe Bailey as the opposition whip', ' They all assembled for the first time in March 1907', ' After the 1907 election, the issue of Chinese mining labour was revisited with Het Volk believing there was enough labour in the form of black and white miners', ' Taking into account the economic interests of the Transvaal, Botha ensured a gradual policy of repatriation of Chinese labour', '  By 1908, the Boers had won in elections, control of Natal, Orange River and Transvaal colonies, but under British influence with the need now to unite the country under one government', '   Progression to Union  [[File:Spelterini Transvaal', 'jpg|thumb|200px|Aerial photography of gold mines, taken by Eduard Spelterini in July 1911]] In May 1908, Jan Smuts, Transvaal Colonial Secretary proposed a gathering of representatives from all four colonies and decide on a customs and railways agreement and included a proposal that the colonies appoint delegates to discuss a constitution for a united country in the form of a National Convention', ' The objective of the convention was to find a solution to the political, racial and economic problems encountered by these colonies and find common ground between Boer and the English', ' On 12 October 1908, the thirty white delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers', ' Twelve delegates came from the Cape Colony, eight from the Transvaal and five each from the Orange River and Natal Colonies representing a gathering of sixteen from an English background and the remaining fourteen were of Boer origin', '  The main issues discussed was whether the four colonies would become a country made up of a union or a federation', ' Who would be allowed to vote and the number of voters who would make-up a constituency in a rural and urban seat', ' All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and Jan Smuts', ' On the question of black enfranchisement, the British government was prepared to accept the final wishes of the National Convention', ' The colonies of the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races', ' A compromise was reached and all the colonies wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement was accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament', ' As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents', ' This system for the constituencies would ensure that the Afrikaner would dominate politics in years to come and would be one of the many reasons why Jan Smuts would lose the 1948 election, sweeping D', 'F', ' Malan to power and the beginning of Apartheid', ' The results of the negotiations at the Convention became the draft South Africa Act which was released for viewing on 9 February 1909', ' By 19 August 1909, the South Africa Act passed through the Houses of Commons and into law', '  As to the question of black enfranchisement, the views of British and Boers were similar with Alfred Milner stating in a speech in 1903, that he believed in white superiority and thought the black man was not ready to rule and had similarly persuaded the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain to allow a future united white government to decide the question of the black franchise', '  Colonial Administration  Prior to the grant of responsible self-government on 6 December 1906, the Colony was administered by an Executive Council appointed by the Governor',

before the war and not increased, so black labour weren't interested in working the mines"", ' Unskilled white labour was ruled out as their wages would be too high for the work done, so the mining magnates and their Chamber of Mines in 1903, sought alternative labour in the form of cheap Chinese workers', ' The legislation to import Chinese labour was introduced to the Transvaal Legislative

council were offered to Louis Botha, Jan Smuts and Koos de la Rey, but they turned the British down', ' Due to a lack of a hearing given to the opinions of the Boer generals by the English administrators concerning Chinese mine labour, due to a belief they did not represent the Boer population, and the want of self-rule, garnered Louis Botha and others to meet in 1904 at a Volkskongres', ' The result of this people congress was the unification of the Boer political movement in the Transvaal into a new party called Het Volk in January 1905 by Louis Botha and Jan Smuts',

movements included the Transvaal Responsible Government Association, the Transvaal Progressive Association and labour groups under an Industrial Labour Party', ' The Transvaal Responsible Government Association was formed in late 1904 by E', 'P Solomon and made up of loose gathering of ex-colonial and ZAR officials and diamond mining magnates, labour and businessmen', ' They called for the allowance of the colony to create its own policy and strive for self-government and the party would eventually be renamed the Nationalists', ' The Transvaal Progressive Association, formed in November 1904 and active from February 1905, had a similar membership but was linked to the mining industry opposed self-rule and preferred a legislature nominated by the High Commissioner with strong links to Britain', ' They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick', '  The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later in February 1907 an election was held with Het Volk running on two issues; Chinese labour needing to be ended when new labour sources were found and reconciliation with Britain with which they hoped would attract the English labourer vote as well as selling themselves as an alternative to the mining capitalistic Progressive Party', '   1907 election   The election was held on 20 February 1907 and

Richard Solomon failed to win his seat', '  The Transvaal Independent Labour Party won three seats in the Witwatersrand after contesting 14, but their leader Frederic Creswell failed to gain a seat',

and Abe Bailey as the opposition whip', ' They all assembled for the first time in March 1907', ' After the 1907 election, the issue of Chinese mining labour was revisited with Het Volk believing there was enough labour in the form of black and white miners', ' Taking into account the economic interests of the Transvaal, Botha ensured a gradual policy of repatriation of Chinese labour', '  By 1908, the Boers had won in elections, control of Natal, Orange River and Transvaal colonies, but under British influence with the need now to unite the country under one government', '   Progression

gathering of representatives from all four colonies and decide on a customs and railways agreement and included a proposal that the colonies appoint delegates to discuss a constitution for a united country in the form of a National Convention', ' The objective of the convention was to find a solution to the political, racial and economic problems encountered by these colonies and find common ground between Boer and the English', ' On 12 October 1908, the thirty white delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers', ' Twelve delegates came from the Cape Colony, eight from the Transvaal and five each from the Orange River and Natal Colonies representing a gathering of sixteen from an English background and the remaining fourteen were of Boer origin', '  The main issues discussed was whether the four colonies would become a country made up of a union or a federation', ' Who would be allowed to vote and the number of voters who would make-up a constituency in a rural and urban seat', ' All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and Jan Smuts', ' On the question of black enfranchisement, the British government was prepared to accept the final wishes of the National Convention', ' The colonies of the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races', ' A compromise was reached and all the colonies wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement was accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament', ' As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents', ' This system for the constituencies would ensure that the Afrikaner would dominate politics in years to come and would be one of the many reasons why Jan Smuts would lose the 1948 election, sweeping D', 'F', ' Malan to power and the beginning of Apartheid', ' The results of the negotiations at the Convention became the draft South Africa Act which was released for viewing on 9 February 1909', ' By 19 August 1909, the South Africa Act passed through the Houses of Commons and into law', '  As to the question of black enfranchisement, the views of British and Boers were similar with Alfred Milner stating in a speech in 1903, that he believed in white superiority and thought the black man was not ready to rule and had similarly persuaded the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain to allow a future united white government to decide the question of

thereafter', '  In 1902, with peace following the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging, the new Transvaal colony was faced with intertwined economic and political issues that need to be resolved', ' The economic issues faced included the restoration of the mining industry to pre-war levels, then growing it further with the need for extra labour, the restoration of the Boers to their lands and increasing the agricultural output of those farms', ' The political issue faced depended on what side of politics one stood on', ' The existing British administrators under Alfred Milner wished to anglicise the population through two main means', ' One by increasing the English-speaking population of the Transvaal and the other by teaching the Boer children in English with very little Dutch used, followed by self-rule', "" The Transvaal Boers' political objectives were the restoration of self-rule in the colony and the political environment to be dominated by the Boers"", '   Repatriation and reconstruction  As the war ended the British were faced with a large proportion of Boer men as prisoners of war and their families in concentration camps', ' As the British followed a scorched earth policy in the Transvaal, Boer lands, stock and farms had been destroyed', '  At the conclusion of the war, it was necessary to reconstruct a ""government"" for the new colony and this was begun with the appointment of a Resident Magistrate in every district of the colony and became District Commissioners while an Assistant Magistrate carried out the legal and magisterial duties of the area', ' Roman-Dutch law was translated into English so the law courts could continue, with some old acts repealed and a considerable amount of new law promulgated by the authorities in Johannesburg', '  The Resident Magistrate then submitted the names of three members of the district to the Governor for district commission under the magistrate', ' They would consist of one British subject, and two Boers, one from those who had surrendered early on in the war and one who had fought until the end', ' The commission would have two functions, one to provide assistance and issuing of rations, equipment, transport and plough animals to those affected by the war, secondly to investigate claims for compensation for actual damages sustained during the war', '  Repatriation depots were established in the districts and they were stocked with food, seed, agricultural equipment, transport, plough animals and stone and building material', ' The rail transport network struggled to

district,  In the larger towns, municipal or health boards were ""appointed"" to manage them under the resident Magistrate', ' They had limited functions and the only rates they levied were for sanitary functions', ' Within fifteen months of the end of the war, the introduction of municipal government was introduced with preparations made for fair elections based on property valuation and the creation of voters rolls with registration process explained in English and Dutch', '  Economic issues The British administrators set out to place most Boer farmers back on their land by March 1903 with nineteen million pounds spent on war damages, grants and loans', ' The administrators reformed the state agricultural departments to modernise farming in the colony which resulted in a maize and beef surplus by 1908', ' They also attempted to solve the poor white problem by settling them as tenant farmers on state land but lack of capital and labour caused the scheme to fail', ' An attempt was made to place English settlers on farmland so as to anglicise the Transvaal and increase the English-speaking population but this failed too as the policy attracted too few settlers', '  By the end of 1901, gold mining finally resumed on the Rand around Johannesburg, having virtually stopped since 1899', ' Backed by the mining magnates and the British administrators, there was a need to restart the industry but labour was required', "" Just prior to the war, white miners wages were high and magnates weren't keen to increase the wages and since black miners wages had been reduced before the war and not increased, so black labour weren't interested in working the mines"", ' Unskilled white labour was ruled out as their wages would be too high for the work done, so the mining magnates and their Chamber of Mines in 1903, sought alternative labour in the form of cheap Chinese workers', ' The legislation to import Chinese labour was introduced to the Transvaal Legislative Council on 28 December 1903 by George Farrar and was debated for 30 hours and successfully voted on after its three readings on 30 December 1903, coming into law in February 1904', ' Having been rubber-stamped by the British and mining appointed Transvaal Legislative Council it outlined extremely restrictive employment contracts for the Chinese workers and the idea had been sold via a fear

1907, South African gold mines represented thirty-two percent of the worlds gold output', ' By 1910, Chinese labour ended on the Witwatersrand and the restrictive job reservation laws preventing Chinese miners doing certain jobs was replicated for Black miners', '  Political issues  From the end of the war in 1902, the political administration of the Transvaal colony was controlled by members of a legislative and executive council, all appointed by the British Administrators under Alfred Milner and the Colonial Secretary in London', ' In 1903, three seats in the Transvaal Legislative council were offered to Louis Botha, Jan Smuts and Koos de la Rey, but they turned the British down', ' Due to a lack of a hearing given to the opinions of the Boer generals by the English administrators concerning Chinese mine labour, due to a belief they did not represent the Boer population, and the want of self-rule, garnered Louis Botha and others to meet in 1904 at a Volkskongres', ' The result of this people congress was the unification of the Boer political movement in the Transvaal into a new party called Het Volk in January 1905 by Louis Botha and Jan Smuts', "" This new party's objective was to seek reconciliation with Britain, which would be favoured by the British opposition Liberal Party, and Boer self-rule for the Transvaal"", '  English political movements included the Transvaal Responsible Government Association, the Transvaal Progressive Association and labour groups under an Industrial Labour Party', ' The Transvaal Responsible Government Association was formed in late 1904 by E', 'P Solomon and made up of loose gathering of ex-colonial and ZAR officials and diamond mining magnates, labour and businessmen', ' They called for the allowance of the colony to create its own policy and strive for self-government and the party would eventually be renamed the Nationalists', ' The Transvaal Progressive Association, formed in November 1904 and active from February 1905, had a similar membership but was linked to the mining industry opposed self-rule and preferred a legislature nominated by the High Commissioner with strong links to Britain', ' They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick', '  The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later in February 1907 an election was held with Het Volk running on two issues; Chinese labour needing to be ended when new labour sources were found and reconciliation with Britain with which they hoped would attract the English labourer vote as well as selling themselves as an alternative to the mining capitalistic Progressive Party', '   1907 election   The election was held on 20 February 1907 and Het Volk won the election gathering 37 of 69 seats', ' It stood 43 candidates and won 34 seats outright, all the country seats were gained bar Barberton, three seats in Pretoria and four on the Witwatersrand with three independents aligning themselves with the party', ' The Progressive Party stood 34 candidates and won 21 seats, twenty on the Witwatersrand and one in Pretoria with five Randlords winning seats', ' Other parties included the Nationalists (old Transvaal Responsible Government Association) that won 6 seats, four on the Witwatersrand and two in Pretoria but their leader Richard Solomon failed to win his seat', '  The Transvaal Independent Labour Party won three seats in the Witwatersrand after contesting 14, but their leader Frederic Creswell failed to gain a seat', '  Louis Botha became Prime Minister of the Transvaal and Agriculture minister with Jan Smuts as its colonial secretary', ' Other new cabinet ministers included J de Villiers, Attorney-General and Mines, Henry Charles Hull, Treasurer, Johann Rissik, Land and Native Affairs, Harry Solomon held Public Works and Edward Rooth as whip', ' The Progressives in opposition would be led by George Farrar and Abe Bailey as the opposition whip', ' They all assembled for the first time in March 1907', ' After the 1907 election, the issue of Chinese mining labour was revisited with Het Volk believing there was enough labour in the form of black and white miners', ' Taking into account the economic interests of the Transvaal, Botha ensured a gradual policy of repatriation of Chinese labour', '  By 1908, the Boers had won in elections, control of Natal, Orange River and Transvaal colonies, but under British influence with the need now to unite the country under one government', '   Progression to Union  [[File:Spelterini Transvaal', 'jpg|thumb|200px|Aerial photography of gold mines, taken by Eduard Spelterini in July 1911]] In May 1908, Jan Smuts, Transvaal Colonial Secretary proposed a gathering of representatives from all four colonies and decide on a customs and railways agreement and included a proposal that the colonies appoint delegates to discuss a constitution for a united country in the form of a National Convention', ' The objective of the convention was to find a solution to the political, racial and economic problems encountered by these colonies and find common ground between Boer and the English', ' On 12 October 1908, the thirty white delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers', ' Twelve delegates came from the Cape Colony, eight from the Transvaal and five each from the Orange River and Natal Colonies representing a gathering of sixteen from an English background and the remaining fourteen were of Boer origin', '  The main issues discussed was whether the four colonies would become a country made up of a union or a federation', ' Who would be allowed to vote and the number of voters who would make-up a constituency in a rural and urban seat', ' All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and Jan Smuts', ' On the question of black enfranchisement, the British government was prepared to accept the final wishes of the National Convention', ' The colonies of the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races', ' A compromise was reached and all the colonies wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement was accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament', ' As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents', ' This system for the constituencies would ensure that the Afrikaner would dominate politics in years to come and would be one of the many reasons why Jan Smuts would lose the 1948 election, sweeping D', 'F', ' Malan to power and the beginning of Apartheid', ' The results of the negotiations at the Convention became the draft South Africa Act which was released for viewing on 9 February 1909', ' By 19 August 1909, the South Africa Act passed through the Houses of Commons and into law', '  As to the question of black enfranchisement, the views of British and Boers were similar with Alfred Milner stating in a speech in 1903, that he believed in white superiority and thought the black man was not ready to rule and had similarly persuaded the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain to allow a future united white government to decide the question of the black franchise', '  Colonial Administration  Prior to the grant of responsible self-government on 6 December 1906, the Colony was administered by an Executive Council appointed by the Governor',
