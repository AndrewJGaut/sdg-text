1907, South African gold mines represented thirty-two percent of the worlds gold output', ' By 1910, Chinese labour ended on the Witwatersrand and the restrictive job reservation laws preventing Chinese miners doing certain jobs was replicated for Black miners', '  Political issues  From the end of the war in 1902, the political administration of the Transvaal colony was controlled by members of a legislative and executive council, all appointed by the British Administrators under Alfred Milner and the Colonial Secretary in London', ' In 1903, three seats in the Transvaal Legislative council were offered to Louis Botha, Jan Smuts and Koos de la Rey, but they turned the British down', ' Due to a lack of a hearing given to the opinions of the Boer generals by the English administrators concerning Chinese mine labour, due to a belief they did not represent the Boer population, and the want of self-rule, garnered Louis Botha and others to meet in 1904 at a Volkskongres', ' The result of this people congress was the unification of the Boer political movement in the Transvaal into a new party called Het Volk in January 1905 by Louis Botha and Jan Smuts', "" This new party's objective was to seek reconciliation with Britain, which would be favoured by the British opposition Liberal Party, and Boer self-rule for the Transvaal"", '  English political movements included the Transvaal Responsible Government Association, the Transvaal Progressive Association and labour groups under an Industrial Labour Party', ' The Transvaal Responsible Government Association was formed in late 1904 by E', 'P Solomon and made up of loose gathering of ex-colonial and ZAR officials and diamond mining magnates, labour and businessmen', ' They called for the allowance of the colony to create its own policy and strive for self-government and the party would eventually be renamed the Nationalists', ' The Transvaal Progressive Association, formed in November 1904 and active from February 1905, had a similar membership but was linked to the mining industry opposed self-rule and preferred a legislature nominated by the High Commissioner with strong links to Britain', ' They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick', '  The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later in February 1907 an election was held with Het Volk running on two issues; Chinese labour needing to be ended when new labour sources were found and reconciliation with Britain with which they hoped would attract the English labourer vote as well as selling themselves as an alternative to the mining capitalistic Progressive Party', '   1907 election   The election was held on 20 February 1907 and Het Volk won the election gathering 37 of 69 seats', ' It stood 43 candidates and won 34 seats outright, all the country seats were gained bar Barberton, three seats in Pretoria and four on the Witwatersrand with three independents aligning themselves with the party', ' The Progressive Party stood 34 candidates and won 21 seats, twenty on the Witwatersrand and one in Pretoria with five Randlords winning seats', ' Other parties included the Nationalists (old Transvaal Responsible Government Association) that won 6 seats, four on the Witwatersrand and two in Pretoria but their leader Richard Solomon failed to win his seat', '  The Transvaal Independent Labour Party won three seats in the Witwatersrand after contesting 14, but their leader Frederic Creswell failed to gain a seat', '  Louis Botha became Prime Minister of the Transvaal and Agriculture minister with Jan Smuts as its colonial secretary', ' Other new cabinet ministers included J de Villiers, Attorney-General and Mines, Henry Charles Hull, Treasurer, Johann Rissik, Land and Native Affairs, Harry Solomon held Public Works and Edward Rooth as whip', ' The Progressives in opposition would be led by George Farrar and Abe Bailey as the opposition whip', ' They all assembled for the first time in March 1907', ' After the 1907 election, the issue of Chinese mining labour was revisited with Het Volk believing there was enough labour in the form of black and white miners', ' Taking into account the economic interests of the Transvaal, Botha ensured a gradual policy of repatriation of Chinese labour', '  By 1908, the Boers had won in elections, control of Natal, Orange River and Transvaal colonies, but under British influence with the need now to unite the country under one government', '   Progression to Union  [[File:Spelterini Transvaal', 'jpg|thumb|200px|Aerial photography of gold mines, taken by Eduard Spelterini in July 1911]] In May 1908, Jan Smuts, Transvaal Colonial Secretary proposed a gathering of representatives from all four colonies and decide on a customs and railways agreement and included a proposal that the colonies appoint delegates to discuss a constitution for a united country in the form of a National Convention', ' The objective of the convention was to find a solution to the political, racial and economic problems encountered by these colonies and find common ground between Boer and the English', ' On 12 October 1908, the thirty white delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers', ' Twelve delegates came from the Cape Colony, eight from the Transvaal and five each from the Orange River and Natal Colonies representing a gathering of sixteen from an English background and the remaining fourteen were of Boer origin', '  The main issues discussed was whether the four colonies would become a country made up of a union or a federation', ' Who would be allowed to vote and the number of voters who would make-up a constituency in a rural and urban seat', ' All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and Jan Smuts', ' On the question of black enfranchisement, the British government was prepared to accept the final wishes of the National Convention', ' The colonies of the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races', ' A compromise was reached and all the colonies wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement was accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament', ' As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents', ' This system for the constituencies would ensure that the Afrikaner would dominate politics in years to come and would be one of the many reasons why Jan Smuts would lose the 1948 election, sweeping D', 'F', ' Malan to power and the beginning of Apartheid', ' The results of the negotiations at the Convention became the draft South Africa Act which was released for viewing on 9 February 1909', ' By 19 August 1909, the South Africa Act passed through the Houses of Commons and into law', '  As to the question of black enfranchisement, the views of British and Boers were similar with Alfred Milner stating in a speech in 1903, that he believed in white superiority and thought the black man was not ready to rule and had similarly persuaded the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain to allow a future united white government to decide the question of the black franchise', '  Colonial Administration  Prior to the grant of responsible self-government on 6 December 1906, the Colony was administered by an Executive Council appointed by the Governor',

identify their ownership of the arrowheads when hunting', '  Border Cave inhabitants 44 ka used technology and cultural symbols that reflect San material culture in the Late Stone Age', ' In addition to the bone points, the notched stick was similar to San poison applicators, and the notch stick actually retains residues of a heated toxic compound', ' Additionally, personal ornaments found in Border Cave consisted of large ostrich egg shells, which was commonly used for ornaments by the San people in the same time period as Boomplaas, Mumba, and Enkapune Ya Muto', ' Analyzing these

sanitary functions', ' Within fifteen months of the end of the war, the introduction of municipal government was introduced with preparations made for fair elections based on property valuation and the creation of voters rolls with registration process explained in English and Dutch', '  Economic issues The British administrators set out to place most Boer farmers back on their land by March 1903 with nineteen million pounds spent on war damages, grants and loans', ' The administrators reformed the state agricultural departments to modernise farming in the colony which resulted in a maize and beef surplus by 1908', ' They also attempted to solve the poor white problem by settling them as tenant farmers on state land but lack of capital and labour caused the scheme to fail', ' An

to restart the industry but labour was required', "" Just prior to the war, white miners wages were high and magnates weren't keen to increase the wages and since black miners wages had been reduced before the war and not increased, so black labour weren't interested in working the mines"", ' Unskilled white labour was ruled out as their wages would be too high for the work done, so the mining magnates and their Chamber of Mines in 1903, sought alternative labour in the form of cheap Chinese workers', ' The legislation to import Chinese labour was introduced to the Transvaal Legislative Council on 28 December 1903 by George Farrar and was debated for 30 hours and successfully voted on after its three readings on 30 December 1903, coming into law in February 1904', ' Having been rubber-stamped by the British and mining appointed Transvaal Legislative Council it outlined extremely restrictive employment contracts for the Chinese workers and the idea had been sold via a fear campaign aimed at white miners about the need for this labour or face the possibility of loss of mining and their jobs', ' By 1906, the gold mines of the Witwatersrand were in full production and by 1907, South African gold mines represented thirty-two percent of the worlds gold output', ' By 1910, Chinese labour ended on the Witwatersrand and the restrictive job reservation laws preventing Chinese miners doing certain jobs was replicated for Black miners', '  Political issues  From the end of the war in 1902, the political administration of the Transvaal colony was controlled by members of a legislative and executive council, all appointed by the British Administrators under Alfred Milner and the Colonial Secretary in London', ' In 1903, three seats in the Transvaal Legislative council were offered to Louis Botha, Jan Smuts and Koos de la Rey, but they turned the British down', ' Due to a lack of a hearing given to the opinions of the Boer generals by the English administrators concerning Chinese mine labour, due to a belief they did not represent the Boer population, and the want of self-rule, garnered Louis Botha and others to meet in 1904 at a Volkskongres', ' The result of this people congress was the unification of the Boer political movement in the Transvaal into a new party called Het Volk in January 1905 by Louis Botha and Jan Smuts', "" This new party's objective was to seek reconciliation with Britain, which would be favoured by the British opposition Liberal Party, and Boer self-rule for the Transvaal"", '  English political movements included the Transvaal Responsible Government Association, the Transvaal Progressive Association and labour groups under an Industrial Labour Party', ' The Transvaal Responsible Government Association was formed in late 1904 by E', 'P Solomon and made up of loose gathering of ex-colonial and ZAR officials and diamond mining magnates, labour and businessmen', ' They called for the allowance of the colony to create its own policy and strive for self-government and the party would eventually be renamed the Nationalists', ' The Transvaal Progressive Association, formed in November 1904 and active from February 1905, had a similar membership but was linked to the mining industry opposed self-rule and preferred a legislature nominated by the High Commissioner with strong links to Britain', ' They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick', '  The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later in February 1907 an election was held with Het Volk running on two issues; Chinese labour needing to be ended when new labour sources were found and reconciliation with Britain with which they hoped would attract the English labourer vote as well as selling themselves as an alternative to the mining capitalistic Progressive Party', '   1907 election   The election was held on 20 February 1907 and Het Volk won the election gathering 37 of 69 seats', ' It stood 43 candidates and won 34 seats outright, all the country seats were gained bar Barberton, three seats in Pretoria and four on the Witwatersrand with three independents aligning themselves with the party', ' The Progressive Party stood 34 candidates and won 21 seats, twenty on the Witwatersrand and one in Pretoria with five Randlords winning seats', ' Other parties included the Nationalists (old Transvaal Responsible Government Association) that won 6 seats, four on the Witwatersrand and two in Pretoria but their leader Richard Solomon failed to win his seat', '  The Transvaal Independent Labour Party won three seats in the Witwatersrand after contesting 14, but their leader Frederic Creswell failed to gain a seat', '  Louis Botha became Prime Minister of the Transvaal and Agriculture minister with Jan Smuts as its colonial secretary', ' Other new cabinet ministers included J de Villiers, Attorney-General and Mines, Henry Charles Hull, Treasurer, Johann Rissik, Land and Native Affairs, Harry Solomon held Public Works and Edward Rooth as whip', ' The Progressives in opposition would be led by George Farrar and Abe Bailey as the opposition whip', ' They all assembled for the first time in March 1907', ' After the 1907 election, the issue of Chinese mining labour was revisited with Het Volk believing there was enough labour in the form of black and white miners', ' Taking into account the economic interests of the Transvaal, Botha ensured a gradual policy of repatriation of Chinese labour', '  By 1908, the Boers had won in elections, control of Natal, Orange River and Transvaal colonies, but under British influence with the need now to unite the country under one government', '   Progression to Union  [[File:Spelterini Transvaal', 'jpg|thumb|200px|Aerial photography of gold mines, taken by Eduard Spelterini in July 1911]] In May 1908, Jan Smuts, Transvaal Colonial Secretary proposed a gathering of representatives from all four colonies and decide on a customs and railways agreement and included a proposal that the colonies appoint delegates to discuss a constitution for a united country in the form of a National Convention', ' The objective of the convention was to find a solution to the political, racial and economic problems encountered by these colonies and find common ground between Boer and the English', ' On 12 October 1908, the thirty white delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers', ' Twelve delegates came from the Cape Colony, eight from the Transvaal and five each from the Orange River and Natal Colonies representing a gathering of sixteen from an English background and the remaining fourteen were of Boer origin', '  The main issues discussed was whether the four colonies would become a country made up of a union or a federation', ' Who would be allowed to vote and the number of voters who would make-up a constituency in a rural and urban seat', ' All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and Jan Smuts', ' On the question of black enfranchisement, the British government was prepared to accept the final wishes of the National Convention', ' The colonies of the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races', ' A compromise was reached and all the colonies wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement was accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament', ' As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents', ' This system for the constituencies would ensure that the Afrikaner would dominate politics in years to come and would be one of the many reasons why Jan Smuts would lose the 1948 election, sweeping D', 'F', ' Malan to power and the beginning of Apartheid', ' The results of the negotiations at the Convention became the draft South Africa Act which was released for viewing on 9 February 1909', ' By 19 August 1909, the South Africa Act passed through the Houses of Commons and into law', '  As to the question of black enfranchisement, the views of British and Boers were similar with Alfred Milner stating in a speech in 1903, that he believed in white superiority and thought the black man was not ready to rule and had similarly persuaded the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain to allow a future united white government to decide the question of

before the war and not increased, so black labour weren't interested in working the mines"", ' Unskilled white labour was ruled out as their wages would be too high for the work done, so the mining magnates and their Chamber of Mines in 1903, sought alternative labour in the form of cheap Chinese workers', ' The legislation to import Chinese labour was introduced to the Transvaal Legislative

1907, South African gold mines represented thirty-two percent of the worlds gold output', ' By 1910, Chinese labour ended on the Witwatersrand and the restrictive job reservation laws preventing Chinese miners doing certain jobs was replicated for Black miners', '  Political issues  From the end of the war in 1902, the political administration of the Transvaal colony was controlled by members

administrators concerning Chinese mine labour, due to a belief they did not represent the Boer population, and the want of self-rule, garnered Louis Botha and others to meet in 1904 at a Volkskongres', ' The result of this people congress was the unification of the Boer political movement in the Transvaal into a new party called Het Volk in January 1905 by Louis Botha and Jan Smuts', "" This new party's objective was to seek reconciliation with Britain, which would be favoured by the British opposition Liberal Party, and Boer self-rule for the Transvaal"", '  English political movements included the Transvaal Responsible Government Association, the Transvaal Progressive Association and labour groups under an Industrial Labour Party', ' The Transvaal Responsible Government Association was formed in late 1904 by E', 'P Solomon and made up of loose gathering of ex-colonial and ZAR officials and diamond mining magnates, labour and businessmen', ' They called for the allowance of the colony to create its own policy and strive for self-government and the party would eventually be renamed the Nationalists', ' The Transvaal Progressive Association, formed in November 1904 and active from February 1905, had a similar membership but was linked to the mining industry opposed self-rule and preferred a legislature nominated by the High Commissioner with strong links to Britain', ' They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick', '  The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later in February 1907 an election was held with Het Volk running on two issues; Chinese labour needing to be ended when new labour sources were found and reconciliation with Britain with which they hoped would attract the English labourer vote as well as selling themselves as an alternative to the mining capitalistic Progressive Party', '   1907 election   The election was held on 20 February 1907 and

Witwatersrand with three independents aligning themselves with the party', ' The Progressive Party stood 34 candidates and won 21 seats, twenty on the Witwatersrand and one in Pretoria with five Randlords winning seats', ' Other parties included the Nationalists (old Transvaal Responsible Government Association) that won 6 seats, four on the Witwatersrand and two in Pretoria but their leader Richard Solomon failed to win his seat', '  The Transvaal Independent Labour Party won three seats in the Witwatersrand after contesting 14, but their leader Frederic Creswell failed to gain a seat',

Mines, Henry Charles Hull, Treasurer, Johann Rissik, Land and Native Affairs, Harry Solomon held Public Works and Edward Rooth as whip', ' The Progressives in opposition would be led by George Farrar and Abe Bailey as the opposition whip', ' They all assembled for the first time in March 1907', ' After the 1907 election, the issue of Chinese mining labour was revisited with Het Volk believing there was enough labour in the form of black and white miners', ' Taking into account the economic interests of the Transvaal, Botha ensured a gradual policy of repatriation of Chinese labour', '  By 1908, the Boers had won in elections, control of Natal, Orange River and Transvaal colonies, but under British influence with the need now to unite the country under one government', '   Progression to Union  [[File:Spelterini Transvaal', 'jpg|thumb|200px|Aerial photography of gold mines, taken by Eduard Spelterini in July 1911]] In May 1908, Jan Smuts, Transvaal Colonial Secretary proposed a gathering of representatives from all four colonies and decide on a customs and railways agreement and included a proposal that the colonies appoint delegates to discuss a constitution for a united country in the form of a National Convention', ' The objective of the convention was to find a solution to the political, racial and economic problems encountered by these colonies and find common ground between Boer and the English', ' On 12 October 1908, the thirty white delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers', ' Twelve delegates came from the Cape Colony, eight from the Transvaal and five each from the Orange River and Natal Colonies representing a gathering of sixteen from an English background and the remaining fourteen were of Boer origin', '  The main issues discussed was whether the four colonies would become a country made up of a union or a federation', ' Who would be allowed to vote and the number of voters who would make-up a constituency in a rural and urban seat', ' All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and Jan Smuts', ' On the question of black enfranchisement, the British government was prepared to accept the final wishes of the National Convention', ' The colonies of the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races', ' A compromise was reached and all the colonies wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement was accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament', ' As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents', ' This system for the constituencies would ensure that the Afrikaner would dominate politics in years to come and would be one of the many reasons why Jan Smuts would lose the 1948 election, sweeping D', 'F', ' Malan to power and the beginning of Apartheid', ' The results of the negotiations at the Convention became the draft South Africa Act which was released for viewing on 9 February 1909', ' By 19 August 1909, the South Africa Act passed through the Houses of Commons and into law', '  As to the question of black enfranchisement, the views of British and Boers were similar with Alfred Milner stating in a speech in 1903, that he believed in white superiority and thought the black man was not ready to rule and had similarly persuaded the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain to allow a future united white government to decide the question of the black franchise', '  Colonial Administration  Prior to the grant of responsible self-government on 6 December 1906, the Colony was administered by an Executive Council appointed by the Governor',

By the end of 1901, gold mining finally resumed on the Rand around Johannesburg, having virtually stopped since 1899', ' Backed by the mining magnates and the British administrators, there was a need to restart the industry but labour was required', "" Just prior to the war, white miners wages were high and magnates weren't keen to increase the wages and since black miners wages had been reduced before the war and not increased, so black labour weren't interested in working the mines"", ' Unskilled white labour was ruled out as their wages would be too high for the work done, so the mining magnates and their Chamber of Mines in 1903, sought alternative labour in the form of cheap Chinese workers', ' The legislation to import Chinese labour was introduced to the Transvaal Legislative Council on 28 December 1903 by George Farrar and was debated for 30 hours and successfully voted on after its three readings on 30 December 1903, coming into law in February 1904', ' Having been rubber-stamped by the British and mining appointed Transvaal Legislative Council it outlined extremely restrictive employment contracts for the Chinese workers and the idea had been sold via a fear campaign aimed at white miners about the need for this labour or face the possibility of loss of mining and their jobs', ' By 1906, the gold mines of the Witwatersrand were in full production and by 1907, South African gold mines represented thirty-two percent of the worlds gold output', ' By 1910, Chinese labour ended on the Witwatersrand and the restrictive job reservation laws preventing Chinese miners doing certain jobs was replicated for Black miners', '  Political issues  From the end of the war in 1902, the political administration of the Transvaal colony was controlled by members of a legislative and executive council, all appointed by the British Administrators under Alfred Milner and the Colonial Secretary in London', ' In 1903, three seats in the Transvaal Legislative council were offered to Louis Botha, Jan Smuts and Koos de la Rey, but they turned the British down', ' Due to a lack of a hearing given to the opinions of the Boer generals by the English administrators concerning Chinese mine labour, due to a belief they did not represent the Boer population, and the want of self-rule, garnered Louis Botha and others to meet in 1904 at a Volkskongres', ' The result of this people congress was the unification of the Boer political movement in the Transvaal into a new party called Het Volk in January 1905 by Louis Botha and Jan Smuts', "" This new party's objective was to seek reconciliation with Britain, which would be favoured by the British opposition Liberal Party, and Boer self-rule for the Transvaal"", '  English political movements included the Transvaal Responsible Government Association, the Transvaal Progressive Association and labour groups under an Industrial Labour Party', ' The Transvaal Responsible Government Association was formed in late 1904 by E', 'P Solomon and made up of loose gathering of ex-colonial and ZAR officials and diamond mining magnates, labour and businessmen', ' They called for the allowance of the colony to create its own policy and strive for self-government and the party would eventually be renamed the Nationalists', ' The Transvaal Progressive Association, formed in November 1904 and active from February 1905, had a similar membership but was linked to the mining industry opposed self-rule and preferred a legislature nominated by the High Commissioner with strong links to Britain', ' They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick', '  The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later in February 1907 an election was held with Het Volk running on two issues; Chinese labour needing to be ended when new labour sources were found and reconciliation with Britain with which they hoped would attract the English labourer vote as well as selling themselves as an alternative to the mining capitalistic Progressive Party', '   1907 election   The election was held on 20 February 1907 and Het Volk won the election gathering 37 of 69 seats', ' It stood 43 candidates and won 34 seats outright, all the country seats were gained bar Barberton, three seats in Pretoria and four on the Witwatersrand with three independents aligning themselves with the party', ' The Progressive Party stood 34 candidates and won 21 seats, twenty on the Witwatersrand and one in Pretoria with five Randlords winning seats', ' Other parties included the Nationalists (old Transvaal Responsible Government Association) that won 6 seats, four on the Witwatersrand and two in Pretoria but their leader Richard Solomon failed to win his seat', '  The Transvaal Independent Labour Party won three seats in the Witwatersrand after contesting 14, but their leader Frederic Creswell failed to gain a seat', '  Louis Botha became Prime Minister of the Transvaal and Agriculture minister with Jan Smuts as its colonial secretary', ' Other new cabinet ministers included J de Villiers, Attorney-General and Mines, Henry Charles Hull, Treasurer, Johann Rissik, Land and Native Affairs, Harry Solomon held Public Works and Edward Rooth as whip', ' The Progressives in opposition would be led by George Farrar and Abe Bailey as the opposition whip', ' They all assembled for the first time in March 1907', ' After the 1907 election, the issue of Chinese mining labour was revisited with Het Volk believing there was enough labour in the form of black and white miners', ' Taking into account the economic interests of the Transvaal, Botha ensured a gradual policy of repatriation of Chinese labour', '  By 1908, the Boers had won in elections, control of Natal, Orange River and Transvaal colonies, but under British influence with the need now to unite the country under one government', '   Progression to Union  [[File:Spelterini Transvaal', 'jpg|thumb|200px|Aerial photography of gold mines, taken by Eduard Spelterini in July 1911]] In May 1908, Jan Smuts, Transvaal Colonial Secretary proposed a gathering of representatives from all four colonies and decide on a customs and railways agreement and included a proposal that the colonies appoint delegates to discuss a constitution for a united country in the form of a National Convention', ' The objective of the convention was to find a solution to the political, racial and economic problems encountered by these colonies and find common ground between Boer and the English', ' On 12 October 1908, the thirty white delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers', ' Twelve delegates came from the Cape Colony, eight from the Transvaal and five each from the Orange River and Natal Colonies representing a gathering of sixteen from an English background and the remaining fourteen were of Boer origin', '  The main issues discussed was whether the four colonies would become a country made up of a union or a federation', ' Who would be allowed to vote and the number of voters who would make-up a constituency in a rural and urban seat', ' All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and Jan Smuts', ' On the question of black enfranchisement, the British government was prepared to accept the final wishes of the National Convention', ' The colonies of the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races', ' A compromise was reached and all the colonies wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement was accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament', ' As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents', ' This system for the constituencies would ensure that the Afrikaner would dominate politics in years to come and would be one of the many reasons why Jan Smuts would lose the 1948 election, sweeping D', 'F', ' Malan to power and the beginning of Apartheid', ' The results of the negotiations at the Convention became the draft South Africa Act which was released for viewing on 9 February 1909', ' By 19 August 1909, the South Africa Act passed through the Houses of Commons and into law', '  As to the question of black enfranchisement, the views of British and Boers were similar with Alfred Milner stating in a speech in 1903, that he believed in white superiority and thought the black man was not ready to rule and had similarly persuaded the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain to allow a future united white government to decide the question of the black franchise', '  Colonial Administration  Prior to the grant of responsible self-government on 6 December 1906, the Colony was administered by an Executive Council appointed by the Governor',

forts built by the government of the South African Republic (ZAR) just before the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Boer War around their capital of Pretoria', '  History After the abortive Jameson Raid, the government of the ZAR became concerned about the safety of its capital city, Pretoria, both from foreign invasion as well as from the growing number of Uitlanders (Foreigners) on the Witwatersrand', ' Consequently, a defence plan for Pretoria was drawn up by a former French artillery officer, Léon Grunberg', ' This plan was approved on 24 March 1896 by the Executive Council of the ZAR', '  The plan recommended that eight strategic positions around the city should be fortified by means of armoured turrets equipped with artillery', ' The positions identified were Schanskop, Kwaggaspoort, Daspoortrand, Magaliesberg-wes, Wonderboompoort, Derdepoort, Strubenkop and Klapperkop', ' The armoured turrets were subsequently found to be unacceptable, and thus the plan of two German engineers, Otto Albert Adolph von Dewitz and Heinrich C Werner to build forts instead, were accepted', ' However, due to a lack of money, only four forts were eventually built', '  The three German forts Fort Schanskop, Fort Wonderboompoort and Fort Klapperkop were designed by Von Dewitz and Werner of the German engineering company Krupp, assisted by architect Christiaan Kuntz and building contractor Celso Giri', '  The three forts are pentagonal reinforced, with more fire range possibilities through numerous facets', ' Attacks from any direction could be warded off by revolving guns on their ramparts', ' To prevent infantry attacks, loopholes were built into the walls', ' Trenches, barbed-wire entanglements and fortified rooms were erected as reinforcements', '  These forts were the most modern structures of their time and modern mediums of communication, such as telephones, were used to equip the telegraph room', '  Many black labourers and about 400 white builders, mostly Italians, were involved in the building of these forts', ' To address technical aspects such as the electrical connections between forts, German and Dutch experts were consulted', '  Fort Schanskop  This fort was built at a cost of GBP £47,500', ' It was handed over to the government on 6 April 1897', ' It was supplied with a paraffin engine powered generator for electricity, electrical lighting and a search light', ' A telephone and telegraphic links were also installed', ' Water was supplied from a pump station in the Fountains Valley which was shared with the nearby Fort Klapperkop', '    The garrison was initially armed with one officer and 30 men and was armed with 37\xa0mm Maxim-Nordenfeldt cannon, Martini-Henry hand-cranked Maxim machine guns and a 155 mm Creusot gun (also known colloquially as a ""Long Tom"")', ' By October 1899, only 17 men were still stationed at the fort', '  Both the garrison and the armaments were gradually reduced during the course of the Second Anglo-Boer war until there was only one man and no guns left over on 5 June 1900, the day on which British forces occupied Pretoria', ' The fort was briefly occupied in 1993 by Willem Ratte to protest the multi-racial government of South Africa at the cost of Boer and Afrikaner heritage', '  The fort was acquired by the Voortrekker Monument complex in June 2000', ' A refurbished statue of Danie Theron, originally from the Danie Theron Combat School in Kimberley, was placed on the perimeter of the fort and unveiled on 6 March 2002', ' A scale model replica of the

Meintjieskop, which was within a mile of the centre of Pretoria and reminded him strongly of some of the acropolises of Greece and Asia Minor, where he had studied Mediterranean architecture', ""  The concept of an acropolis and a building that agreed with renowned British Architect Sir Christopher Wren's theory that a public building should be a national ornament which establishes a nation, draws

blocks, each representing one of the two official languages', ' They were to be linked by a semicircular wing, and the space in-between the two wings was levelled to bring form an amphitheatre as in the Greek fashion for gatherings of national and ceremonial importance', '  Baker wanted the buildings to be built of imported granite, but any idea of using anything but South African stone for the most important government building of the new state was unthinkable to those who commissioned it, as a result, the terraces and retaining walls in the grounds are built predominantly of mountain stone quarried on site, the foundation of the building is of granite, while freestone was used for the exterior walls, the amphitheatre and major courtyards', '  For the overall design of the building, Baker chose the neo-classic architecture of the Italian Renaissance, and also combined an idiom of the English Renaissance, as well as significant elements of Cape Dutch detail, such as in the carved

council were offered to Louis Botha, Jan Smuts and Koos de la Rey, but they turned the British down', ' Due to a lack of a hearing given to the opinions of the Boer generals by the English administrators concerning Chinese mine labour, due to a belief they did not represent the Boer population, and the want of self-rule, garnered Louis Botha and others to meet in 1904 at a Volkskongres', ' The result of this people congress was the unification of the Boer political movement in the Transvaal into a new party called Het Volk in January 1905 by Louis Botha and Jan Smuts',

movements included the Transvaal Responsible Government Association, the Transvaal Progressive Association and labour groups under an Industrial Labour Party', ' The Transvaal Responsible Government Association was formed in late 1904 by E', 'P Solomon and made up of loose gathering of ex-colonial and ZAR officials and diamond mining magnates, labour and businessmen', ' They called for the allowance of the colony to create its own policy and strive for self-government and the party would eventually be renamed the Nationalists', ' The Transvaal Progressive Association, formed in November 1904 and active from February 1905, had a similar membership but was linked to the mining industry opposed self-rule and preferred a legislature nominated by the High Commissioner with strong links to Britain', ' They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick', '  The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later in February 1907 an election was held with Het Volk running on two issues; Chinese labour needing to be ended when new labour sources were found and reconciliation with Britain with which they hoped would attract the English labourer vote as well as selling themselves as an alternative to the mining capitalistic Progressive Party', '   1907 election   The election was held on 20 February 1907 and

and Abe Bailey as the opposition whip', ' They all assembled for the first time in March 1907', ' After the 1907 election, the issue of Chinese mining labour was revisited with Het Volk believing there was enough labour in the form of black and white miners', ' Taking into account the economic interests of the Transvaal, Botha ensured a gradual policy of repatriation of Chinese labour', '  By 1908, the Boers had won in elections, control of Natal, Orange River and Transvaal colonies, but under British influence with the need now to unite the country under one government', '   Progression to Union  [[File:Spelterini Transvaal', 'jpg|thumb|200px|Aerial photography of gold mines, taken by Eduard Spelterini in July 1911]] In May 1908, Jan Smuts, Transvaal Colonial Secretary proposed a gathering of representatives from all four colonies and decide on a customs and railways agreement and included a proposal that the colonies appoint delegates to discuss a constitution for a united country in the form of a National Convention', ' The objective of the convention was to find a solution to the political, racial and economic problems encountered by these colonies and find common ground between Boer and the English', ' On 12 October 1908, the thirty white delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers', ' Twelve delegates came from the Cape Colony, eight from the Transvaal and five each from the Orange River and Natal Colonies representing a gathering of sixteen from an English background and the remaining fourteen were of Boer origin', '  The main issues discussed was whether the four colonies would become a country made up of a union or a federation', ' Who would be allowed to vote and the number of voters who would make-up a constituency in a rural and urban seat', ' All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and Jan Smuts', ' On the question of black enfranchisement, the British government was prepared to accept the final wishes of the National Convention', ' The colonies of the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races', ' A compromise was reached and all the colonies wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement was accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament', ' As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents', ' This system for the constituencies would ensure that the Afrikaner would dominate politics in years to come and would be one of the many reasons why Jan Smuts would lose the 1948 election, sweeping D', 'F', ' Malan to power and the beginning of Apartheid', ' The results of the negotiations at the Convention became the draft South Africa Act which was released for viewing on 9 February 1909', ' By 19 August 1909, the South Africa Act passed through the Houses of Commons and into law', '  As to the question of black enfranchisement, the views of British and Boers were similar with Alfred Milner stating in a speech in 1903, that he believed in white superiority and thought the black man was not ready to rule and had similarly persuaded the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain to allow a future united white government to decide the question of

scorched earth policy in the Transvaal, Boer lands, stock and farms had been destroyed', '  At the conclusion of the war, it was necessary to reconstruct a ""government"" for the new colony and this was begun with the appointment of a Resident Magistrate in every district of the colony and became District Commissioners while an Assistant Magistrate carried out the legal and magisterial duties of the area', ' Roman-Dutch law was translated into English so the law courts could continue, with some old acts repealed and a considerable amount of new law promulgated by the authorities in Johannesburg', '  The Resident Magistrate then submitted the names of three members of the district to the Governor for district commission under the magistrate', ' They would consist of one British subject, and two Boers, one from those who had surrendered early on in the war and one who had fought until the end', ' The commission would have two functions, one to provide assistance and issuing of rations, equipment, transport and plough animals to those affected by the war, secondly to investigate claims for compensation for actual damages sustained during the war', '  Repatriation depots were established in the districts and they were stocked with food, seed, agricultural equipment, transport, plough animals and stone and building material', ' The rail transport network struggled to compete with the transport of army requirement to maintain a garrison and civilian requirements to repair the colony', ' All feed for transport animals had to be brought to the depots as the process started in the winter of 1902', ' Refugees from the concentration camps and prisoners of war were returned to their districts in a system of drafts', ' At the depots, they would receive farm equipment, tents and rations to start again and transport to their destinations', ' Food rations were provided for almost a year', ' Families would receive a token grant irrespective of their ability to pay it back and additional material and equipment required were obtained via interest-free loans with small cash loans also attracting no interest, with larger loans attracting four percent interest by a mortgage', ' The loan scheme was never going to compensate a person for the actual loss experienced by the war', ' Damage and the reconstruction required varied from district to district,  In the larger towns, municipal or health boards were ""appointed"" to manage them under the resident Magistrate', ' They had limited functions and the only rates they levied were for sanitary functions', ' Within fifteen months of the end of the war, the introduction of municipal government was introduced with preparations made for fair elections based on property valuation and the creation of voters rolls with registration process explained in English and Dutch', '  Economic issues The British administrators set out to place most Boer farmers back on their land by March 1903 with nineteen million pounds spent on war damages, grants and loans', ' The administrators reformed the state agricultural departments to modernise farming in the colony which resulted in a maize and beef surplus by 1908', ' They also attempted to solve the poor white problem by settling them as tenant farmers on state land but lack of capital and labour caused the scheme to fail', ' An attempt was made to place English settlers on farmland so as to anglicise the Transvaal and increase the English-speaking population but this failed too as the policy attracted too few settlers', '  By the end of 1901, gold mining finally resumed on the Rand around Johannesburg, having virtually stopped since 1899', ' Backed by the mining magnates and the British administrators, there was a need to restart the industry but labour was required', "" Just prior to the war, white miners wages were high and magnates weren't keen to increase the wages and since black miners wages had been reduced before the war and not increased, so black labour weren't interested in working the mines"", ' Unskilled white labour was ruled out as their wages would be too high for the work done, so the mining magnates and their Chamber of Mines in 1903, sought alternative labour in the form of cheap Chinese workers', ' The legislation to import Chinese labour was introduced to the Transvaal Legislative Council on 28 December 1903 by George Farrar and was debated for 30 hours and successfully voted on after its three readings on 30 December 1903, coming into law in February 1904', ' Having been rubber-stamped by the British and mining appointed Transvaal Legislative Council it outlined extremely restrictive employment contracts for the Chinese workers and the idea had been sold via a fear campaign aimed at white miners about the need for this labour or face the possibility of loss of mining and their jobs', ' By 1906, the gold mines of the Witwatersrand were in full production and by 1907, South African gold mines represented thirty-two percent of the worlds gold output', ' By 1910, Chinese labour ended on the Witwatersrand and the restrictive job reservation laws preventing Chinese miners doing certain jobs was replicated for Black miners', '  Political issues  From the end of the war in 1902, the political administration of the Transvaal colony was controlled by members of a legislative and executive council, all appointed by the British Administrators under Alfred Milner and the Colonial Secretary in London', ' In 1903, three seats in the Transvaal Legislative council were offered to Louis Botha, Jan Smuts and Koos de la Rey, but they turned the British down', ' Due to a lack of a hearing given to the opinions of the Boer generals by the English administrators concerning Chinese mine labour, due to a belief they did not represent the Boer population, and the want of self-rule, garnered Louis Botha and others to meet in 1904 at a Volkskongres', ' The result of this people congress was the unification of the Boer political movement in the Transvaal into a new party called Het Volk in January 1905 by Louis Botha and Jan Smuts', "" This new party's objective was to seek reconciliation with Britain, which would be favoured by the British opposition Liberal Party, and Boer self-rule for the Transvaal"", '  English political movements included the Transvaal Responsible Government Association, the Transvaal Progressive Association and labour groups under an Industrial Labour Party', ' The Transvaal Responsible Government Association was formed in late 1904 by E', 'P Solomon and made up of loose gathering of ex-colonial and ZAR officials and diamond mining magnates, labour and businessmen', ' They called for the allowance of the colony to create its own policy and strive for self-government and the party would eventually be renamed the Nationalists', ' The Transvaal Progressive Association, formed in November 1904 and active from February 1905, had a similar membership but was linked to the mining industry opposed self-rule and preferred a legislature nominated by the High Commissioner with strong links to Britain', ' They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick', '  The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later in February 1907 an election was held with Het Volk running on two issues; Chinese labour needing to be ended when new labour sources were found and reconciliation with Britain with which they hoped would attract the English labourer vote as well as selling themselves as an alternative to the mining capitalistic Progressive Party', '   1907 election   The election was held on 20 February 1907 and Het Volk won the election gathering 37 of 69 seats', ' It stood 43 candidates and won 34 seats outright, all the country seats were gained bar Barberton, three seats in Pretoria and four on the Witwatersrand with three independents aligning themselves with the party', ' The Progressive Party stood 34 candidates and won 21 seats, twenty on the Witwatersrand and one in Pretoria with five Randlords winning seats', ' Other parties included the Nationalists (old Transvaal Responsible Government Association) that won 6 seats, four on the Witwatersrand and two in Pretoria but their leader Richard Solomon failed to win his seat', '  The Transvaal Independent Labour Party won three seats in the Witwatersrand after contesting 14, but their leader Frederic Creswell failed to gain a seat', '  Louis Botha became Prime Minister of the Transvaal and Agriculture minister with Jan Smuts as its colonial secretary', ' Other new cabinet ministers included J de Villiers, Attorney-General and Mines, Henry Charles Hull, Treasurer, Johann Rissik, Land and Native Affairs, Harry Solomon held Public Works and Edward Rooth as whip', ' The Progressives in opposition would be led by George Farrar and Abe Bailey as the opposition whip', ' They all assembled for the first time in March 1907', ' After the 1907 election, the issue of Chinese mining labour was revisited with Het Volk believing there was enough labour in the form of black and white miners', ' Taking into account the economic interests of the Transvaal, Botha ensured a gradual policy of repatriation of Chinese labour', '  By 1908, the Boers had won in elections, control of Natal, Orange River and Transvaal colonies, but under British influence with the need now to unite the country under one government', '   Progression to Union  [[File:Spelterini Transvaal', 'jpg|thumb|200px|Aerial photography of gold mines, taken by Eduard Spelterini in July 1911]] In May 1908, Jan Smuts, Transvaal Colonial Secretary proposed a gathering of representatives from all four colonies and decide on a customs and railways agreement and included a proposal that the colonies appoint delegates to discuss a constitution for a united country in the form of a National Convention', ' The objective of the convention was to find a solution to the political, racial and economic problems encountered by these colonies and find common ground between Boer and the English', ' On 12 October 1908, the thirty white delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers', ' Twelve delegates came from the Cape Colony, eight from the Transvaal and five each from the Orange River and Natal Colonies representing a gathering of sixteen from an English background and the remaining fourteen were of Boer origin', '  The main issues discussed was whether the four colonies would become a country made up of a union or a federation', ' Who would be allowed to vote and the number of voters who would make-up a constituency in a rural and urban seat', ' All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and Jan Smuts', ' On the question of black enfranchisement, the British government was prepared to accept the final wishes of the National Convention', ' The colonies of the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races', ' A compromise was reached and all the colonies wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement was accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament', ' As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents', ' This system for the constituencies would ensure that the Afrikaner would dominate politics in years to come and would be one of the many reasons why Jan Smuts would lose the 1948 election, sweeping D', 'F', ' Malan to power and the beginning of Apartheid', ' The results of the negotiations at the Convention became the draft South Africa Act which was released for viewing on 9 February 1909', ' By 19 August 1909, the South Africa Act passed through the Houses of Commons and into law', '  As to the question of black enfranchisement, the views of British and Boers were similar with Alfred Milner stating in a speech in 1903, that he believed in white superiority and thought the black man was not ready to rule and had similarly persuaded the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain to allow a future united white government to decide the question of the black franchise', '  Colonial Administration  Prior to the grant of responsible self-government on 6 December 1906, the Colony was administered by an Executive Council appointed by the Governor',

council were offered to Louis Botha, Jan Smuts and Koos de la Rey, but they turned the British down', ' Due to a lack of a hearing given to the opinions of the Boer generals by the English administrators concerning Chinese mine labour, due to a belief they did not represent the Boer population, and the want of self-rule, garnered Louis Botha and others to meet in 1904 at a Volkskongres', ' The result of this people congress was the unification of the Boer political movement in the Transvaal into a new party called Het Volk in January 1905 by Louis Botha and Jan Smuts', "" This new party's objective was to seek reconciliation with Britain, which would be favoured by the British opposition Liberal Party, and Boer self-rule for the Transvaal"", '  English political movements included the Transvaal Responsible Government Association, the Transvaal Progressive Association and labour groups under an Industrial Labour Party', ' The Transvaal Responsible Government Association was formed in late 1904 by E', 'P Solomon and made up of loose gathering of ex-colonial and ZAR officials and diamond mining magnates, labour and businessmen', ' They called for the allowance of the colony to create its own policy and strive for self-government and the party would eventually be renamed the Nationalists', ' The Transvaal Progressive Association, formed in November 1904 and active from February 1905, had a similar membership but was linked to the mining industry opposed self-rule and preferred a legislature nominated by the High Commissioner with strong links to Britain', ' They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick', '  The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later in February 1907 an election was held with Het Volk running on two issues; Chinese labour needing to be ended when new labour sources were found and reconciliation with Britain with which they hoped would attract the English labourer vote as well as selling themselves as an alternative to the mining capitalistic Progressive Party', '   1907 election   The election was held on 20 February 1907 and Het Volk won the election gathering 37 of 69 seats', ' It stood 43 candidates and won 34 seats outright, all the country seats were gained bar Barberton, three seats in Pretoria and four on the Witwatersrand with three independents aligning themselves with the party', ' The Progressive Party stood 34 candidates and won 21 seats, twenty on the Witwatersrand and one in Pretoria with five Randlords winning seats', ' Other parties included the Nationalists (old Transvaal Responsible Government Association) that won 6 seats, four on the Witwatersrand and two in Pretoria but their leader Richard Solomon failed to win his seat', '  The Transvaal Independent Labour Party won three seats in the Witwatersrand after contesting 14, but their leader Frederic Creswell failed to gain a seat', '  Louis Botha became Prime Minister of the Transvaal and Agriculture minister with Jan Smuts as its colonial secretary', ' Other new cabinet ministers included J de Villiers, Attorney-General and Mines, Henry Charles Hull, Treasurer, Johann Rissik, Land and Native Affairs, Harry Solomon held Public Works and Edward Rooth as whip', ' The Progressives in opposition would be led by George Farrar and Abe Bailey as the opposition whip', ' They all assembled for the first time in March 1907', ' After the 1907 election, the issue of Chinese mining labour was revisited with Het Volk believing there was enough labour in the form of black and white miners', ' Taking into account the economic interests of the Transvaal, Botha ensured a gradual policy of repatriation of Chinese labour', '  By 1908, the Boers had won in elections, control of Natal, Orange River and Transvaal colonies, but under British influence with the need now to unite the country under one government', '   Progression to Union  [[File:Spelterini Transvaal', 'jpg|thumb|200px|Aerial photography of gold mines, taken by Eduard Spelterini in July 1911]] In May 1908, Jan Smuts, Transvaal Colonial Secretary proposed a gathering of representatives from all four colonies and decide on a customs and railways agreement and included a proposal that the colonies appoint delegates to discuss a constitution for a united country in the form of a National Convention', ' The objective of the convention was to find a solution to the political, racial and economic problems encountered by these colonies and find common ground between Boer and the English', ' On 12 October 1908, the thirty white delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers', ' Twelve delegates came from the Cape Colony, eight from the Transvaal and five each from the Orange River and Natal Colonies representing a gathering of sixteen from an English background and the remaining fourteen were of Boer origin', '  The main issues discussed was whether the four colonies would become a country made up of a union or a federation', ' Who would be allowed to vote and the number of voters who would make-up a constituency in a rural and urban seat', ' All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and Jan Smuts', ' On the question of black enfranchisement, the British government was prepared to accept the final wishes of the National Convention', ' The colonies of the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races', ' A compromise was reached and all the colonies wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement was accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament', ' As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents', ' This system for the constituencies would ensure that the Afrikaner would dominate politics in years to come and would be one of the many reasons why Jan Smuts would lose the 1948 election, sweeping D', 'F', ' Malan to power and the beginning of Apartheid', ' The results of the negotiations at the Convention became the draft South Africa Act which was released for viewing on 9 February 1909', ' By 19 August 1909, the South Africa Act passed through the Houses of Commons and into law', '  As to the question of black enfranchisement, the views of British and Boers were similar with Alfred Milner stating in a speech in 1903, that he believed in white superiority and thought the black man was not ready to rule and had similarly persuaded the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain to allow a future united white government to decide the question of the black franchise', '  Colonial Administration  Prior to the grant of responsible self-government on 6 December 1906, the Colony was administered by an Executive Council appointed by the Governor',

reconstruction of homes affected by the war', ' To that end, the crown agrees to a free grant of £3,000,000 as well as loans at no interest for two years to be repaid at 3 percent interest over years thereafter', '  In 1902, with peace following the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging, the new Transvaal colony was faced with intertwined economic and political issues that need to be resolved', ' The economic issues faced included the restoration of the mining industry to pre-war levels, then growing it further with the need for extra labour, the restoration of the Boers to their lands and increasing the agricultural output of those farms', ' The political issue faced depended on what side of politics one stood on', ' The existing British administrators under Alfred Milner wished to anglicise the population through two main means', ' One by increasing the English-speaking population of the Transvaal and the other by teaching the Boer children in English with very little Dutch used, followed by self-rule', "" The Transvaal Boers' political objectives were the restoration of self-rule in the colony and the political environment to be dominated by the Boers"", '   Repatriation and reconstruction  As the war ended the British were faced with a large proportion of Boer men as prisoners of war and their families in concentration camps', ' As the British followed a scorched earth policy in the Transvaal, Boer lands, stock and farms had been destroyed', '  At the conclusion of the war, it was necessary to reconstruct a ""government"" for the new colony and this was begun with the appointment of a Resident Magistrate in every district of the colony and became District Commissioners while an Assistant Magistrate carried out the legal and magisterial duties of the area', ' Roman-Dutch law was translated into English so the law courts could continue, with some old acts repealed and a considerable amount of new law promulgated by the authorities in Johannesburg', '  The Resident Magistrate then submitted the names of three members of the district to the Governor for district commission under the magistrate', ' They would consist of one British subject, and two Boers, one from those who had surrendered early on in the war and one who had fought until the end', ' The commission would have two functions, one to provide assistance and issuing of rations, equipment, transport and plough animals to those affected by the war, secondly to investigate claims for compensation for actual damages sustained during the war', '  Repatriation depots were established in the districts and they were stocked with food, seed, agricultural equipment, transport, plough animals and stone and building material', ' The rail transport network struggled to compete with the transport of army requirement to maintain a garrison and civilian requirements to repair the colony', ' All feed for transport animals had to be brought to the depots as the process started in the winter of 1902', ' Refugees from the concentration camps and prisoners of war were returned to their districts in a system of drafts', ' At the depots, they would receive farm equipment, tents and rations to start again and transport to their destinations', ' Food rations were provided for almost a year', ' Families would receive a token grant irrespective of their ability to pay it back and additional material and equipment required were obtained via interest-free loans with small cash loans also attracting no interest, with larger loans attracting four percent interest by a mortgage', ' The loan scheme was never going to compensate a person for the actual loss experienced by the war', ' Damage and the reconstruction required varied from district to district,  In the larger towns, municipal or health boards were ""appointed"" to manage them under the resident Magistrate', ' They had limited functions and the only rates they levied were for sanitary functions', ' Within fifteen months of the end of the war, the introduction of municipal government was introduced with preparations made for fair elections based on property valuation and the creation of voters rolls with registration process explained in English and Dutch', '  Economic issues The British administrators set out to place most Boer farmers back on their land by March 1903 with nineteen million pounds spent on war damages, grants and loans', ' The administrators reformed the state agricultural departments to modernise farming in the colony which resulted in a maize and beef surplus by 1908', ' They also attempted to solve the poor white problem by settling them as tenant farmers on state land but lack of capital and labour caused the scheme to fail', ' An attempt was made to place English settlers on farmland so as to anglicise the Transvaal and increase the English-speaking population but this failed too as the policy attracted too few settlers', '  By the end of 1901, gold mining finally resumed on the Rand around Johannesburg, having virtually stopped since 1899', ' Backed by the mining magnates and the British administrators, there was a need to restart the industry but labour was required', "" Just prior to the war, white miners wages were high and magnates weren't keen to increase the wages and since black miners wages had been reduced before the war and not increased, so black labour weren't interested in working the mines"", ' Unskilled white labour was ruled out as their wages would be too high for the work done, so the mining magnates and their Chamber of Mines in 1903, sought alternative labour in the form of cheap Chinese workers', ' The legislation to import Chinese labour was introduced to the Transvaal Legislative Council on 28 December 1903 by George Farrar and was debated for 30 hours and successfully voted on after its three readings on 30 December 1903, coming into law in February 1904', ' Having been rubber-stamped by the British and mining appointed Transvaal Legislative Council it outlined extremely restrictive employment contracts for the Chinese workers and the idea had been sold via a fear campaign aimed at white miners about the need for this labour or face the possibility of loss of mining and their jobs', ' By 1906, the gold mines of the Witwatersrand were in full production and by 1907, South African gold mines represented thirty-two percent of the worlds gold output', ' By 1910, Chinese labour ended on the Witwatersrand and the restrictive job reservation laws preventing Chinese miners doing certain jobs was replicated for Black miners', '  Political issues  From the end of the war in 1902, the political administration of the Transvaal colony was controlled by members of a legislative and executive council, all appointed by the British Administrators under Alfred Milner and the Colonial Secretary in London', ' In 1903, three seats in the Transvaal Legislative council were offered to Louis Botha, Jan Smuts and Koos de la Rey, but they turned the British down', ' Due to a lack of a hearing given to the opinions of the Boer generals by the English administrators concerning Chinese mine labour, due to a belief they did not represent the Boer population, and the want of self-rule, garnered Louis Botha and others to meet in 1904 at a Volkskongres', ' The result of this people congress was the unification of the Boer political movement in the Transvaal into a new party called Het Volk in January 1905 by Louis Botha and Jan Smuts', "" This new party's objective was to seek reconciliation with Britain, which would be favoured by the British opposition Liberal Party, and Boer self-rule for the Transvaal"", '  English political movements included the Transvaal Responsible Government Association, the Transvaal Progressive Association and labour groups under an Industrial Labour Party', ' The Transvaal Responsible Government Association was formed in late 1904 by E', 'P Solomon and made up of loose gathering of ex-colonial and ZAR officials and diamond mining magnates, labour and businessmen', ' They called for the allowance of the colony to create its own policy and strive for self-government and the party would eventually be renamed the Nationalists', ' The Transvaal Progressive Association, formed in November 1904 and active from February 1905, had a similar membership but was linked to the mining industry opposed self-rule and preferred a legislature nominated by the High Commissioner with strong links to Britain', ' They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick', '  The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later in February 1907 an election was held with Het Volk running on two issues; Chinese labour needing to be ended when new labour sources were found and reconciliation with Britain with which they hoped would attract the English labourer vote as well as selling themselves as an alternative to the mining capitalistic Progressive Party', '   1907 election   The election was held on 20 February 1907 and Het Volk won the election gathering 37 of 69 seats', ' It stood 43 candidates and won 34 seats outright, all the country seats were gained bar Barberton, three seats in Pretoria and four on the Witwatersrand with three independents aligning themselves with the party', ' The Progressive Party stood 34 candidates and won 21 seats, twenty on the Witwatersrand and one in Pretoria with five Randlords winning seats', ' Other parties included the Nationalists (old Transvaal Responsible Government Association) that won 6 seats, four on the Witwatersrand and two in Pretoria but their leader Richard Solomon failed to win his seat', '  The Transvaal Independent Labour Party won three seats in the Witwatersrand after contesting 14, but their leader Frederic Creswell failed to gain a seat', '  Louis Botha became Prime Minister of the Transvaal and Agriculture minister with Jan Smuts as its colonial secretary', ' Other new cabinet ministers included J de Villiers, Attorney-General and Mines, Henry Charles Hull, Treasurer, Johann Rissik, Land and Native Affairs, Harry Solomon held Public Works and Edward Rooth as whip', ' The Progressives in opposition would be led by George Farrar and Abe Bailey as the opposition whip', ' They all assembled for the first time in March 1907', ' After the 1907 election, the issue of Chinese mining labour was revisited with Het Volk believing there was enough labour in the form of black and white miners', ' Taking into account the economic interests of the Transvaal, Botha ensured a gradual policy of repatriation of Chinese labour', '  By 1908, the Boers had won in elections, control of Natal, Orange River and Transvaal colonies, but under British influence with the need now to unite the country under one government', '   Progression to Union  [[File:Spelterini Transvaal', 'jpg|thumb|200px|Aerial photography of gold mines, taken by Eduard Spelterini in July 1911]] In May 1908, Jan Smuts, Transvaal Colonial Secretary proposed a gathering of representatives from all four colonies and decide on a customs and railways agreement and included a proposal that the colonies appoint delegates to discuss a constitution for a united country in the form of a National Convention', ' The objective of the convention was to find a solution to the political, racial and economic problems encountered by these colonies and find common ground between Boer and the English', ' On 12 October 1908, the thirty white delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers', ' Twelve delegates came from the Cape Colony, eight from the Transvaal and five each from the Orange River and Natal Colonies representing a gathering of sixteen from an English background and the remaining fourteen were of Boer origin', '  The main issues discussed was whether the four colonies would become a country made up of a union or a federation', ' Who would be allowed to vote and the number of voters who would make-up a constituency in a rural and urban seat', ' All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and Jan Smuts', ' On the question of black enfranchisement, the British government was prepared to accept the final wishes of the National Convention', ' The colonies of the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races', ' A compromise was reached and all the colonies wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement was accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament', ' As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents', ' This system for the constituencies would ensure that the Afrikaner would dominate politics in years to come and would be one of the many reasons why Jan Smuts would lose the 1948 election, sweeping D', 'F', ' Malan to power and the beginning of Apartheid', ' The results of the negotiations at the Convention became the draft South Africa Act which was released for viewing on 9 February 1909', ' By 19 August 1909, the South Africa Act passed through the Houses of Commons and into law', '  As to the question of black enfranchisement, the views of British and Boers were similar with Alfred Milner stating in a speech in 1903, that he believed in white superiority and thought the black man was not ready to rule and had similarly persuaded the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain to allow a future united white government to decide the question of the black franchise', '  Colonial Administration  Prior to the grant of responsible self-government on 6 December 1906, the Colony was administered by an Executive Council appointed by the Governor',

The economic issues faced included the restoration of the mining industry to pre-war levels, then growing it further with the need for extra labour, the restoration of the Boers to their lands and increasing the agricultural output of those farms', ' The political issue faced depended on what side of politics one stood on', ' The existing British administrators under Alfred Milner wished to anglicise the population through two main means', ' One by increasing the English-speaking population of the Transvaal and the other by teaching the Boer children in English with very little Dutch used, followed by self-rule', "" The Transvaal Boers' political objectives were the restoration of self-rule in the colony and the political environment to be dominated by the Boers"", '

to pay it back and additional material and equipment required were obtained via interest-free loans with small cash loans also attracting no interest, with larger loans attracting four percent

district,  In the larger towns, municipal or health boards were ""appointed"" to manage them under the resident Magistrate', ' They had limited functions and the only rates they levied were for sanitary functions', ' Within fifteen months of the end of the war, the introduction of municipal government was introduced with preparations made for fair elections based on property valuation and the creation of voters rolls with registration process explained in English and Dutch', '  Economic issues The British administrators set out to place most Boer farmers back on their land by March 1903 with nineteen million pounds spent on war damages, grants and loans', ' The administrators reformed the state agricultural departments to modernise farming in the colony which resulted in a maize and beef surplus by 1908', ' They also attempted to solve the poor white problem by settling them as tenant farmers on state land but lack of capital and labour caused the scheme to fail', ' An

to restart the industry but labour was required', "" Just prior to the war, white miners wages were high and magnates weren't keen to increase the wages and since black miners wages had been reduced before the war and not increased, so black labour weren't interested in working the mines"", ' Unskilled white labour was ruled out as their wages would be too high for the work done, so the mining magnates and their Chamber of Mines in 1903, sought alternative labour in the form of cheap Chinese workers', ' The legislation to import Chinese labour was introduced to the Transvaal Legislative Council on 28 December 1903 by George Farrar and was debated for 30 hours and successfully voted on after its three readings on 30 December 1903, coming into law in February 1904', ' Having been rubber-stamped by the British and mining appointed Transvaal Legislative Council it outlined extremely restrictive employment contracts for the Chinese workers and the idea had been sold via a fear

1907, South African gold mines represented thirty-two percent of the worlds gold output', ' By 1910, Chinese labour ended on the Witwatersrand and the restrictive job reservation laws preventing Chinese miners doing certain jobs was replicated for Black miners', '  Political issues  From the end of the war in 1902, the political administration of the Transvaal colony was controlled by members of a legislative and executive council, all appointed by the British Administrators under Alfred Milner and the Colonial Secretary in London', ' In 1903, three seats in the Transvaal Legislative council were offered to Louis Botha, Jan Smuts and Koos de la Rey, but they turned the British down', ' Due to a lack of a hearing given to the opinions of the Boer generals by the English administrators concerning Chinese mine labour, due to a belief they did not represent the Boer population, and the want of self-rule, garnered Louis Botha and others to meet in 1904 at a Volkskongres', ' The result of this people congress was the unification of the Boer political movement in the Transvaal into a new party called Het Volk in January 1905 by Louis Botha and Jan Smuts', "" This new party's objective was to seek reconciliation with Britain, which would be favoured by the British opposition Liberal Party, and Boer self-rule for the Transvaal"", '  English political movements included the Transvaal Responsible Government Association, the Transvaal Progressive Association and labour groups under an Industrial Labour Party', ' The Transvaal Responsible Government Association was formed in late 1904 by E', 'P Solomon and made up of loose gathering of ex-colonial and ZAR officials and diamond mining magnates, labour and businessmen', ' They called for the allowance of the colony to create its own policy and strive for self-government and the party would eventually be renamed the Nationalists', ' The Transvaal Progressive Association, formed in November 1904 and active from February 1905, had a similar membership but was linked to the mining industry opposed self-rule and preferred a legislature nominated by the High Commissioner with strong links to Britain', ' They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick', '  The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later in February 1907 an election was held with Het Volk running on two issues; Chinese labour needing to be ended when new labour sources were found and reconciliation with Britain with which they hoped would attract the English labourer vote as well as selling themselves as an alternative to the mining capitalistic Progressive Party', '   1907 election   The election was held on 20 February 1907 and

Witwatersrand with three independents aligning themselves with the party', ' The Progressive Party stood 34 candidates and won 21 seats, twenty on the Witwatersrand and one in Pretoria with five Randlords winning seats', ' Other parties included the Nationalists (old Transvaal Responsible Government Association) that won 6 seats, four on the Witwatersrand and two in Pretoria but their leader Richard Solomon failed to win his seat', '  The Transvaal Independent Labour Party won three seats in the Witwatersrand after contesting 14, but their leader Frederic Creswell failed to gain a seat', '  Louis Botha became Prime Minister of the Transvaal and Agriculture minister with Jan Smuts as its colonial secretary', ' Other new cabinet ministers included J de Villiers, Attorney-General and Mines, Henry Charles Hull, Treasurer, Johann Rissik, Land and Native Affairs, Harry Solomon held Public Works and Edward Rooth as whip', ' The Progressives in opposition would be led by George Farrar and Abe Bailey as the opposition whip', ' They all assembled for the first time in March 1907', ' After the 1907 election, the issue of Chinese mining labour was revisited with Het Volk believing there was enough labour in the form of black and white miners', ' Taking into account the economic interests of the Transvaal, Botha ensured a gradual policy of repatriation of Chinese labour', '  By 1908, the Boers had won in elections, control of Natal, Orange River and Transvaal colonies, but under British influence with the need now to unite the country under one government', '   Progression to Union  [[File:Spelterini Transvaal', 'jpg|thumb|200px|Aerial photography of gold mines, taken by Eduard Spelterini in July 1911]] In May 1908, Jan Smuts, Transvaal Colonial Secretary proposed a gathering of representatives from all four colonies and decide on a customs and railways agreement and included a proposal that the colonies appoint delegates to discuss a constitution for a united country in the form of a National Convention', ' The objective of the convention was to find a solution to the political, racial and economic problems encountered by these colonies and find common ground between Boer and the English', ' On 12 October 1908, the thirty white delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers', ' Twelve delegates came from the Cape Colony, eight from the Transvaal and five each from the Orange River and Natal Colonies representing a gathering of sixteen from an English background and the remaining fourteen were of Boer origin', '  The main issues discussed was whether the four colonies would become a country made up of a union or a federation', ' Who would be allowed to vote and the number of voters who would make-up a constituency in a rural and urban seat', ' All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and Jan Smuts', ' On the question of black enfranchisement, the British government was prepared to accept the final wishes of the National Convention', ' The colonies of the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races', ' A compromise was reached and all the colonies wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement was accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament', ' As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents', ' This system for the constituencies would ensure that the Afrikaner would dominate politics in years to come and would be one of the many reasons why Jan Smuts would lose the 1948 election, sweeping D', 'F', ' Malan to power and the beginning of Apartheid', ' The results of the negotiations at the Convention became the draft South Africa Act which was released for viewing on 9 February 1909', ' By 19 August 1909, the South Africa Act passed through the Houses of Commons and into law', '  As to the question of black enfranchisement, the views of British and Boers were similar with Alfred Milner stating in a speech in 1903, that he believed in white superiority and thought the black man was not ready to rule and had similarly persuaded the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain to allow a future united white government to decide the question of the black franchise', '  Colonial Administration  Prior to the grant of responsible self-government on 6 December 1906, the Colony was administered by an Executive Council appointed by the Governor',

the government of the ZAR became concerned about the safety of its capital city, Pretoria, both from foreign invasion as well as from the growing number of Uitlanders (Foreigners) on the Witwatersrand', ' Consequently, a defence plan for Pretoria was drawn up by a former French artillery officer, Léon Grunberg', ' This plan was approved on 24 March 1896 by the Executive Council of the ZAR', '  The plan recommended that eight strategic positions around the city should be fortified by means of armoured turrets equipped with artillery', ' The positions identified were Schanskop, Kwaggaspoort, Daspoortrand, Magaliesberg-wes, Wonderboompoort, Derdepoort, Strubenkop and Klapperkop', ' The armoured turrets were subsequently found to be unacceptable, and thus the plan of two

revolving guns on their ramparts', ' To prevent infantry attacks, loopholes were built into the walls', ' Trenches, barbed-wire entanglements and fortified rooms were erected as reinforcements', '  These forts were the most modern structures of their time and modern mediums of communication, such as telephones, were used to equip the telegraph room', '  Many black labourers and about 400 white

self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later

make-up a constituency in a rural and urban seat', ' All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and Jan Smuts', ' On the question of black enfranchisement, the British government was prepared to accept the final wishes of the National Convention', ' The colonies of the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races', ' A compromise was reached and all the colonies wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement was accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament', ' As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents', ' This system for the constituencies would ensure that the
