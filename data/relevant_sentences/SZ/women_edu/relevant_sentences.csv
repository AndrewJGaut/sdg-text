government', '  A board of enquiry blamed the captain for failing to react to the Ground Proximity Warning System', "" Another theory was that the crew had set the aircraft's VOR receivers to the wrong frequency, causing them to receive signals from a different airport, or even that a false beacon had been used to lure the crew off course"", "" While there was widespread suspicion in other

aeroplane commenced a turn away from Maputo to the right, lasting almost one minute in duration and a resulting heading change from 184° magnetic to 221°', ' At this time the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) recorded the navigator stating the distance remaining to Maputo as , then a comment from the captain about the turn, and the navigator\'s response that the ""VOR indicates that way""', '  Around 21:15 the navigator stated that the distance to Maputo was ', ' Over the next few minutes, there were several comments from the crew indicating that they believed the navigational aids at Maputo were unavailable: the captain stated that ""there is no Maputo"" and ""electrical power is off, chaps!"", while the navigator reported that the Instrument Landing System (ILS) and Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) were switched off and that the non-directional beacons (NDBs) were not working', '  Landing clearance and crash Shortly after 21:18, the aircraft reached  in its descent, and the crew informed the Maputo controller that they were maintaining that altitude', '  However, the aeroplane continued to descend', ' The Maputo controller granted clearance to the flight for an ILS approach to runway 23, but after the flight crew reported the ILS out of service, the controller changed the clearance to a visual approach to runway 05', ' During this time, the navigator stated the distance to Maputo as , the captain remarked that something was wrong, and the co-pilot said that the runway was not lit', '  The crew radioed the Maputo controller and asked him to ""check your runway lights""', ' Around 21:21 the navigator stated the range to Maputo as , and the flight repeated its request to Maputo to check runway lights', ' Upon reaching an altitude of  AGL the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) sounded and remained on and, although the captain cursed, the descent continued', '  During the last 22 seconds of the flight, the crew twice more radioed Maputo about the runway lights, affirming that they were not in sight, which was eventually acknowledged by the Maputo controller', ' Meanwhile, the captain stated ""cloudy, cloudy, cloudy"" and the navigator exclaimed ""no, no, there\'s nowhere to go, there\'s no NDBs, nothing!""', ' The captain then added ""Neither NDBs, nor ILS!"", which were the last words recorded on the CVR', ' The aircraft first impacted terrain at

scene the South African police located and took custody of the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR) (the aircraft was equipped with both digital and magnetic FDRs)', ' According to Pik Botha this was due to suspicions that they could be tampered with', ' Media access to the site was limited to a team from SABC-TV', ' Autopsies were conducted on only the four dead flight crew and three others and the bodies returned to Mozambique without the approval of the SACAA', 'Beeld, 19 October 2006  On arrival, Mozambican minister Sérgio Vieira asked for the documents that were taken from the aircraft to be handed to him', ' The SA commissioner of police, Johann Coetzee, had already made copies of these, and the documents were transferred to Vieira', 'New African, January

reached for representatives of South Africa, Mozambique and the Soviet Union to jointly examine the CVR tapes under Swiss auspices in Zurich', '  Board of Inquiry  Formation According to South Africa, approaches were made to both the United States National Transportation Safety Board and the British Air Accidents Investigation Branch requesting official assistance in the investigation, however both agencies were not willing to become involved on an individual basis', ' Pik Botha would later state that on his recommendation, due to the mounting suspicions of South African culpability in the crash, the services of three foreign individuals were obtained, and these persons became three of the six members of the Board of Inquiry', "" These individuals were: Frank Borman, an aeronautical engineer, former United States test pilot, astronaut and CEO of Eastern Air Lines, Geoffrey Wilkinson, former head of the British Department for Transport's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, and Sir Edward Eveleigh, former Lord Justice of Appeal and member of the British Privy Council"", '  The three South African board members included J', 'J', 'S', ' Germishuys, former South African Commissioner for Civil Aviation, and Pieter van Hoven, chairman of the Airlines Association of South Africa', ' The inquiry was chaired by Cecil Margo, a member of the South African Supreme Court who had participated in several other high-profile aircraft accident investigations previously', ' Board members participated in the earlier fact-finding portion of the investigation, and conducted public hearings at the Supreme Court in Johannesburg from 20 January until 26 January 1987', ' The board then adjourned to analyze the evidence and reach conclusions as to cause', ""  Analysis The board concluded that the 37° turn was executed by the navigator using the autopilot's Doppler navigation mode, which when set maintained the desired heading while making corrections for wind drift"", ' The navigator performed this turn after he saw the VOR signal indicating that the aircraft had intercepted the Maputo VOR 45° radial, the compass direction from Maputo on which the crew intended to turn and approach for a landing on runway 23', ' However the turn actually put the aircraft on a path following a 45° radial from the VOR beacon at Matsapa Airport, Swaziland', '  Discounting the possibility of a false VOR beacon, an analysis of which was included in an appendix, the board considered it probable that the flight crew had inadvertently set the first of two VOR receivers on board to the Matsapa VOR frequency', ' This error was made more likely by the poor design of the instruments, the absence of back lighting of the selected frequencies, the fact the two frequencies were unusually close, 112', '7 MHz for Maputo and 112', ""3\xa0MHz for Matsapa, and the similarity between the figures '7' and '3' on the Soviet instrumentation"", '  The board considered it ""quite likely"" that after the turn the captain re-tuned first VOR receiver to the ILS frequency, as the instrument was found in this state after the crash', ' For the final stages of flight, the aircraft was not following any VOR signal; instead the autopilot was tracking the 221° heading the navigator had set earlier during the turn', "" The post-accident settings of the second VOR receiver showed that it was displaying the aeroplane's position relative to Maputo and was correctly set to the Maputo VOR frequency, but was apparently not being used to guide the autopilot nor was it being monitored by the crew"", ""  The captain's initial erroneous assumption that Maputo had suffered an electrical blackout was never reconsidered by the crew, despite evidence to the contrary"", ' Throughout the descent the crew were in radio contact with the Maputo controller, who therefore had electrical power, and backup power generators were standard equipment for airport navigational aids', ' All the navigation aids at Maputo were determined by the board to be working at the time of the accident, although the aircraft was flying too far away and too low to receive the ILS and NDB signals', ' When announcing the distance remaining to Maputo the navigator was apparently referring to the Doppler navigation system, which was not accurate, rather than the DME equipment available on board which correctly displayed the distance to the Maputo DME beacon', '  The crew were criticized for failing to perform any checklist items or navigational aid identification, as well as for the distractions and non-essential conversations in the cockpit during the descent into Maputo', ' As a consequence of not announcing to the other crew members which navigational aids were being used, or the frequencies being set, mistakes could not be corrected by others through ""cross-checking""', ' Regarding it essential that the relatively large crew in the cockpit work as a well-integrated team, the board concluded that ""demonstrably they had not""', '  The board found that use of non-standard phraseology between the Maputo controller and the crew led to confusion about the status of the ILS signal and whether the runway lights were on', ' The flight crew\'s repeated requests to ""check runway lights"" were interpreted by the controller, based on the use of the word \'check\' in civil aviation, as confirmation by the crew that they had the runway lights in sight', ' The aircraft had not refueled at Mbala before departing and did not have enough fuel remaining to reach the intended alternative airport in Beira, Mozambique by the time it reached Maputo', ' This may have greatly increased the pressure on the crew to continue with the landing approach to Maputo despite the difficulties encountered', '  Although the Maputo controller had specifically cleared the aircraft only to  and no lower until the runway lights were in sight, the descent continued below that height at a rate of , without the runway lights visible, in darkness and partially cloudy conditions', ' The only reaction to the warning by the GPWS, which sounded for 32 seconds, was the captain exclaiming ""Damn it!"" and a very slight nose-up pitch of the aircraft', ' The board concluded that even just seconds before the impact had the crew performed the required procedures for a GPWS alert when flying over hilly or unknown terrain, quickly raising the nose and increasing power, this would have prevented the crash', ' The captain was singled out for criticism by the board for the decision to continue the descent without any ground references and with the belief that all navigation aids at Maputo were not working, instead of climbing to the published minimum safe altitude for the Maputo area of  and verifying his position through other aids available, including his radar', '  Findings The board of inquiry determined that:  In addition the board issued five safety recommendations which covered the use of and recurrent training in approved terminology in ATC communications for both ground and flight crews, monitoring of crew compliance with established procedures, a proposal that CVRs retain a record of the last hour of flight, rather than the standard of 30 minutes, and the importance of maintaining navigational aids to international standards', '  The report was endorsed unanimously by the six members of the board and submitted to the South African Minister of Transport Affairs on 2 July 1987', '  Mozambican submission The Mozambican delegation, representing

prepared for an ILS approach to runway 23, however  away from Maputo the aircraft turned 37° to the right', ' This turn was a result of a false VOR signal situated beyond the limit of Maputo airport, and resulted in the aeroplane being led into hilly ground and its collision with terrain', ' This signal, also received by a LAM Airlines Boeing 737, was the result of a premeditated action', '  The weather conditions along the route, at Maputo airport and at the alternative airport did not hamper the flight and was not a cause of the outcome', '  Conspiracy theories and subsequent investigations

Repatriation and reconstruction  As the war ended the British were faced with a large proportion of Boer men as prisoners of war and their families in concentration camps', ' As the British followed a scorched earth policy in the Transvaal, Boer lands, stock and farms had been destroyed', '  At the conclusion of the war, it was necessary to reconstruct a ""government"" for the new colony and this was begun with the appointment of a Resident Magistrate in every district of the colony and became District Commissioners while an Assistant Magistrate carried out the legal and magisterial duties of the area', ' Roman-Dutch law was translated into English so the law courts could continue, with some old acts repealed and a considerable amount of new law promulgated by the authorities in Johannesburg', '  The Resident Magistrate then submitted the names of three members of the district to the Governor for district commission under the magistrate', ' They would consist of one British subject, and two Boers, one from those who had surrendered early on in the war and one who had fought until the end', ' The commission would have two functions, one to provide assistance and issuing of rations, equipment, transport and plough animals to those affected by the war, secondly to investigate claims for compensation for actual damages sustained during the war', '  Repatriation depots were established in the districts and they were stocked with food, seed, agricultural equipment, transport, plough animals and stone and building material', ' The rail transport network struggled to compete with the transport of army requirement to maintain a garrison and civilian requirements to repair the colony', ' All feed for transport animals had to be brought to the depots as the process started in the winter of 1902', ' Refugees from the concentration camps and prisoners of war were returned to their districts in a system of drafts', ' At the depots, they would receive farm equipment, tents and rations to start again and transport to their destinations', ' Food rations were provided for almost a year', ' Families would receive a token grant irrespective of their ability to pay it back and additional material and equipment required were obtained via interest-free loans with small cash loans also attracting no interest, with larger loans attracting four percent interest by a mortgage', ' The loan scheme was never going to compensate a person for the actual loss experienced by the war', ' Damage and the reconstruction required varied from district to district,  In the larger towns, municipal or health boards were ""appointed"" to manage them under the resident Magistrate', ' They had limited functions and the only rates they levied were for sanitary functions', ' Within fifteen months of the end of the war, the introduction of municipal government was introduced with preparations made for fair elections based on property valuation and the creation of voters rolls with registration process explained in English and Dutch', '  Economic issues The British administrators set out to place most Boer farmers back on their land by March 1903 with nineteen million pounds spent on war damages, grants and loans', ' The administrators reformed the state agricultural departments to modernise farming in the colony which resulted in a maize and beef surplus by 1908', ' They also attempted to solve the poor white problem by settling them as tenant farmers on state land but lack of capital and labour caused the scheme to fail', ' An attempt was made to place English settlers on farmland so as to anglicise the Transvaal and increase the English-speaking population but this failed too as the policy attracted too few settlers', '  By the end of 1901, gold mining finally resumed on the Rand around Johannesburg, having virtually stopped since 1899', ' Backed by the mining magnates and the British administrators, there was a need to restart the industry but labour was required', "" Just prior to the war, white miners wages were high and magnates weren't keen to increase the wages and since black miners wages had been reduced before the war and not increased, so black labour weren't interested in working the mines"", ' Unskilled white labour was ruled out as their wages would be too high for the work done, so the mining magnates and their Chamber of Mines in 1903, sought alternative labour in the form of cheap Chinese workers', ' The legislation to import Chinese labour was introduced to the Transvaal Legislative Council on 28 December 1903 by George Farrar and was debated for 30 hours and successfully voted on after its three readings on 30 December 1903, coming into law in February 1904', ' Having been rubber-stamped by the British and mining appointed Transvaal Legislative Council it outlined extremely restrictive employment contracts for the Chinese workers and the idea had been sold via a fear campaign aimed at white miners about the need for this labour or face the possibility of loss of mining and their jobs', ' By 1906, the gold mines of the Witwatersrand were in full production and by 1907, South African gold mines represented thirty-two percent of the worlds gold output', ' By 1910, Chinese labour ended on the Witwatersrand and the restrictive job reservation laws preventing Chinese miners doing certain jobs was replicated for Black miners', '  Political issues  From the end of the war in 1902, the political administration of the Transvaal colony was controlled by members of a legislative and executive council, all appointed by the British Administrators under Alfred Milner and the Colonial Secretary in London', ' In 1903, three seats in the Transvaal Legislative council were offered to Louis Botha, Jan Smuts and Koos de la Rey, but they turned the British down', ' Due to a lack of a hearing given to the opinions of the Boer generals by the English administrators concerning Chinese mine labour, due to a belief they did not represent the Boer population, and the want of self-rule, garnered Louis Botha and others to meet in 1904 at a Volkskongres', ' The result of this people congress was the unification of the Boer political movement in the Transvaal into a new party called Het Volk in January 1905 by Louis Botha and Jan Smuts', "" This new party's objective was to seek reconciliation with Britain, which would be favoured by the British opposition Liberal Party, and Boer self-rule for the Transvaal"", '  English political movements included the Transvaal Responsible Government Association, the Transvaal Progressive Association and labour groups under an Industrial Labour Party', ' The Transvaal Responsible Government Association was formed in late 1904 by E', 'P Solomon and made up of loose gathering of ex-colonial and ZAR officials and diamond mining magnates, labour and businessmen', ' They called for the allowance of the colony to create its own policy and strive for self-government and the party would eventually be renamed the Nationalists', ' The Transvaal Progressive Association, formed in November 1904 and active from February 1905, had a similar membership but was linked to the mining industry opposed self-rule and preferred a legislature nominated by the High Commissioner with strong links to Britain', ' They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick', '  The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later in February 1907 an election was held with Het Volk running on two issues; Chinese labour needing to be ended when new labour sources were found and reconciliation with Britain with which they hoped would attract the English labourer vote as well as selling themselves as an alternative to the mining capitalistic Progressive Party', '   1907 election   The election was held on 20 February 1907 and Het Volk won the election gathering 37 of 69 seats', ' It stood 43 candidates and won 34 seats outright, all the country seats were gained bar Barberton, three seats in Pretoria and four on the Witwatersrand with three independents aligning themselves with the party', ' The Progressive Party stood 34 candidates and won 21 seats, twenty on the Witwatersrand and one in Pretoria with five Randlords winning seats', ' Other parties included the Nationalists (old Transvaal Responsible Government Association) that won 6 seats, four on the Witwatersrand and two in Pretoria but their leader Richard Solomon failed to win his seat', '  The Transvaal Independent Labour Party won three seats in the Witwatersrand after contesting 14, but their leader Frederic Creswell failed to gain a seat', '  Louis Botha became Prime Minister of the Transvaal and Agriculture minister with Jan Smuts as its colonial secretary', ' Other new cabinet ministers included J de Villiers, Attorney-General and Mines, Henry Charles Hull, Treasurer, Johann Rissik, Land and Native Affairs, Harry Solomon held Public Works and Edward Rooth as whip', ' The Progressives in opposition would be led by George Farrar and Abe Bailey as the opposition whip', ' They all assembled for the first time in March 1907', ' After the 1907 election, the issue of Chinese mining labour was revisited with Het Volk believing there was enough labour in the form of black and white miners', ' Taking into account the economic interests of the Transvaal, Botha ensured a gradual policy of repatriation of Chinese labour', '  By 1908, the Boers had won in elections, control of Natal, Orange River and Transvaal colonies, but under British influence with the need now to unite the country under one government', '   Progression to Union  [[File:Spelterini Transvaal', 'jpg|thumb|200px|Aerial photography of gold mines, taken by Eduard Spelterini in July 1911]] In May 1908, Jan Smuts, Transvaal Colonial Secretary proposed a gathering of representatives from all four colonies and decide on a customs and railways agreement and included a proposal that the colonies appoint delegates to discuss a constitution for a united country in the form of a National Convention', ' The objective of the convention was to find a solution to the political, racial and economic problems encountered by these colonies and find common ground between Boer and the English', ' On 12 October 1908, the thirty white delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers', ' Twelve delegates came from the Cape Colony, eight from the Transvaal and five each from the Orange River and Natal Colonies representing a gathering of sixteen from an English background and the remaining fourteen were of Boer origin', '  The main issues discussed was whether the four colonies would become a country made up of a union or a federation', ' Who would be allowed to vote and the number of voters who would make-up a constituency in a rural and urban seat', ' All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and Jan Smuts', ' On the question of black enfranchisement, the British government was prepared to accept the final wishes of the National Convention', ' The colonies of the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races', ' A compromise was reached and all the colonies wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement was accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament', ' As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents', ' This system for the constituencies would ensure that the Afrikaner would dominate politics in years to come and would be one of the many reasons why Jan Smuts would lose the 1948 election, sweeping D', 'F', ' Malan to power and the beginning of Apartheid', ' The results of the negotiations at the Convention became the draft South Africa Act which was released for viewing on 9 February 1909', ' By 19 August 1909, the South Africa Act passed through the Houses of Commons and into law', '  As to the question of black enfranchisement, the views of British and Boers were similar with Alfred Milner stating in a speech in 1903, that he believed in white superiority and thought the black man was not ready to rule and had similarly persuaded the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain to allow a future united white government to decide the question of the black franchise', '  Colonial Administration  Prior to the grant of responsible self-government on 6 December 1906, the Colony was administered by an Executive Council appointed by the Governor',

Mbuzini, South Africa', ' Nine passengers and one crew member survived the crash, but President Machel and 33 others died, including several ministers and senior officials of the Mozambican government', '  A board of enquiry blamed the captain for failing to react to the Ground Proximity Warning System', "" Another theory was that the crew had set the aircraft's VOR receivers to the wrong frequency, causing them to receive signals from a different airport, or even that a false beacon had been used to lure the crew off course"", "" While there was widespread suspicion in other nations that South Africa, which was hostile towards Machel's government at the time, was involved in the incident, no conclusive evidence was ever presented to support that allegation"", '   Crash All times in this article are local (UTC+2)', '  Aircraft, flight crew and itinerary thumb|C9-CAA, the aircraft involved in the accident The aeroplane being used to transport Machel that day, registration  was manufactured by Tupolev in 1980 according to specifications for Mozambique', ' It had flown about 1,100 flying hours since the first flight, and had undergone its last major inspection in August 1984 in the Soviet Union', ' Service records indicated that it had been properly maintained, and data recovered from the Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) showed the aircraft and all its systems were operating normally', '  The flight crew of five consisted of captain Yuri Viktorovich Novodran (48), co-pilot Igor Petrovich Kartamyshev (29), flight engineer Vladimir B', ' Novoselov (37), navigator Oleg Nikolaevich Kudryashov (48), and radio operator Anatoly Shulipov (39), all of whom were Soviet state employees operating the aircraft for the Mozambican government', ' They were well experienced in both day and night flying in Mozambique and in landings at Maputo airport', '  On the morning of 19 October, Machel boarded the aeroplane at Maputo, and after a refuelling stop in Lusaka, Zambia arrived at Mbala at 11:00', ' After the meeting with Kaunda and Dos Santos, Machel and his party re-boarded the aircraft and departed Mbala at 18:38 for a non-stop return to Maputo', ' The weather forecast for the flight was favourable, with an estimated time of arrival of 21:25', '  Start of descent and 37° turn  At 20:46, the flight made its first radio contact with Maputo Air Traffic Control (ATC), reporting its position and that it was continuing towards the Maputo VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) navigation beacon while maintaining an altitude of

began their descent for an ILS approach to runway 23', '  Over the next eight minutes the aircraft maintained its required track toward Maputo with minor lateral deviations', ' Then at 21:10 the aeroplane commenced a turn away from Maputo to the right, lasting almost one minute in duration and a resulting heading change from 184° magnetic to 221°', ' At this time the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) recorded the navigator stating the distance remaining to Maputo as , then a comment from the captain about the turn, and the navigator\'s response that the ""VOR indicates that way""', '  Around 21:15 the navigator stated that the distance to Maputo was ', ' Over the next few minutes, there were several comments from the crew indicating that they believed the navigational aids at Maputo were unavailable: the captain stated that ""there is no Maputo"" and ""electrical power is off, chaps!"", while the navigator reported that the Instrument Landing System (ILS) and Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) were switched off and that the non-directional beacons (NDBs) were not working', '  Landing clearance and crash Shortly after 21:18, the aircraft reached  in its descent, and the crew informed the Maputo controller that they were maintaining that altitude', '  However, the aeroplane continued to descend', ' The Maputo controller granted clearance to the flight for an ILS approach to runway 23, but after the flight crew reported the ILS out of service, the controller changed the clearance to a visual approach to runway 05', ' During this time, the navigator stated the distance to Maputo as , the captain remarked that something was wrong, and the co-pilot said that the runway was not lit', '  The crew radioed the Maputo controller and asked him to ""check your runway lights""', ' Around 21:21 the navigator stated the range to Maputo as , and the flight repeated its request to Maputo to check runway lights', ' Upon reaching an altitude of  AGL the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) sounded and remained on and, although the captain cursed, the descent continued', '  During the last 22 seconds of the flight, the crew twice more radioed Maputo about the runway lights, affirming that they were not in sight, which was eventually acknowledged by the Maputo controller', ' Meanwhile, the captain stated ""cloudy, cloudy, cloudy"" and the navigator exclaimed ""no, no, there\'s nowhere to go, there\'s no NDBs, nothing!""', ' The captain then added ""Neither NDBs, nor ILS!"", which were the last words recorded on the CVR', ' The aircraft first impacted terrain at

approaches were made to both the United States National Transportation Safety Board and the British Air Accidents Investigation Branch requesting official assistance in the investigation, however both agencies were not willing to become involved on an individual basis', ' Pik Botha would later state that on his recommendation, due to the mounting suspicions of South African culpability in the crash, the services of three foreign individuals were obtained, and these persons became three of the six members of the Board of Inquiry', "" These individuals were: Frank Borman, an aeronautical engineer, former United States test pilot, astronaut and CEO of Eastern Air Lines, Geoffrey Wilkinson, former head of the British Department for Transport's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, and Sir Edward Eveleigh, former Lord Justice of Appeal and member of the British Privy Council"", '  The three South African board members included J', 'J', 'S', ' Germishuys, former South African Commissioner for Civil Aviation, and Pieter van Hoven, chairman of the Airlines Association of South Africa', ' The inquiry was chaired by Cecil Margo, a member of the South African Supreme Court who had participated in several other high-profile aircraft accident investigations previously', ' Board members participated in the earlier fact-finding portion of the investigation, and conducted public hearings at the Supreme Court in Johannesburg from 20 January until 26 January 1987', ' The board then adjourned to analyze the evidence and reach conclusions as to cause', ""  Analysis The board concluded that the 37° turn was executed by the navigator using the autopilot's Doppler navigation mode, which when set maintained the desired heading while making corrections for wind drift"", ' The navigator performed this turn after he saw the VOR signal indicating that the aircraft had intercepted the Maputo VOR 45° radial, the compass direction from Maputo on which the crew intended to turn and approach for a landing on runway 23', ' However the turn actually put the aircraft on a path following a 45° radial from the VOR beacon at Matsapa Airport, Swaziland', '  Discounting the possibility of a false VOR beacon, an analysis of which was included in an appendix, the board considered it probable that the flight crew had inadvertently set the first of two VOR receivers on board to the Matsapa VOR frequency', ' This error was made more likely by the poor design of the instruments, the absence of back lighting of the selected frequencies, the fact the two frequencies were unusually close, 112', '7 MHz for Maputo and 112', ""3\xa0MHz for Matsapa, and the similarity between the figures '7' and '3' on the Soviet instrumentation"", '  The board considered it ""quite likely"" that after the turn the captain re-tuned first VOR receiver to the ILS frequency, as the instrument was found in this state after the crash', ' For the final stages of flight, the aircraft was not following any VOR signal; instead the autopilot was tracking the 221° heading the navigator had set earlier during the turn', "" The post-accident settings of the second VOR receiver showed that it was displaying the aeroplane's position relative to Maputo and was correctly set to the Maputo VOR frequency, but was apparently not being used to guide the autopilot nor was it being monitored by the crew"", ""  The captain's initial erroneous assumption that Maputo had suffered an electrical blackout was never reconsidered by the crew, despite evidence to the contrary"", ' Throughout the descent the crew were in radio contact with the Maputo controller, who therefore had electrical power, and backup power generators were standard equipment for airport navigational aids', ' All the navigation aids at Maputo were determined by the board to be working at the time of the accident, although the aircraft was flying too far away and too low to receive the ILS and NDB signals', ' When announcing the distance remaining to Maputo the navigator was apparently referring to the Doppler navigation system, which was not accurate, rather than the DME equipment available on board which correctly displayed the distance to the Maputo DME beacon', '  The crew were criticized for failing to perform any checklist items or navigational aid identification, as well as for the distractions and non-essential conversations in the cockpit during the descent into Maputo', ' As a consequence of not announcing to the other crew members which navigational aids were being used, or the frequencies being set, mistakes could not be corrected by others through ""cross-checking""', ' Regarding it essential that the relatively large crew in the cockpit work as a well-integrated team, the board concluded that ""demonstrably they had not""', '  The board found that use of non-standard phraseology between the Maputo controller and the crew led to confusion about the status of the ILS signal and whether the runway lights were on', ' The flight crew\'s repeated requests to ""check runway lights"" were interpreted by the controller, based on the use of the word \'check\' in civil aviation, as confirmation by the crew that they had the runway lights in sight', ' The aircraft had not refueled at Mbala before departing and did not have enough fuel remaining to reach the intended alternative airport in Beira, Mozambique by the time it reached Maputo', ' This may have greatly increased the pressure on the crew to continue with the landing approach to Maputo despite the difficulties encountered', '  Although the Maputo controller had specifically cleared the aircraft only to  and no lower until the runway lights were in sight, the descent continued below that height at a rate of , without the runway lights visible, in darkness and partially cloudy conditions', ' The only reaction to the warning by the GPWS, which sounded for 32 seconds, was the captain exclaiming ""Damn it!"" and a very slight nose-up pitch of the aircraft', ' The board concluded that even just seconds before the impact had the crew performed the required procedures for a GPWS alert when flying over hilly or unknown terrain, quickly raising the nose and increasing power, this would have prevented the crash', ' The captain was singled out for criticism by the board for the decision to continue the descent without any ground references and with the belief that all navigation aids at Maputo were not working, instead of climbing to the published minimum safe altitude for the Maputo area of  and verifying his position through other aids available, including his radar', '  Findings The board of inquiry determined that:  In addition the board issued five safety recommendations

Edward Eveleigh, former Lord Justice of Appeal and member of the British Privy Council"", '  The three South African board members included J', 'J', 'S', ' Germishuys, former South African

had participated in several other high-profile aircraft accident investigations previously', ' Board members participated in the earlier fact-finding portion of the investigation, and conducted public hearings at the Supreme Court in Johannesburg from 20 January until 26 January 1987', ' The board then adjourned to analyze the evidence and reach conclusions as to cause', ""  Analysis The board concluded that the 37° turn was executed by the navigator using the autopilot's Doppler navigation mode, which when set maintained the desired heading while making corrections for wind drift"", ' The navigator performed this turn after he saw the VOR signal indicating that the aircraft had intercepted the Maputo VOR 45° radial, the compass direction from Maputo on which the crew intended to turn and approach for a landing on runway 23', ' However the turn actually put the aircraft on a path following a 45° radial from the VOR beacon at Matsapa Airport, Swaziland', '  Discounting the possibility of a false VOR beacon, an analysis of which was included in an appendix, the board considered it probable that the flight crew had inadvertently set the first of two VOR receivers on board to the Matsapa VOR frequency', ' This error was made more likely by the poor design of the instruments, the absence of back lighting of the selected frequencies, the fact the two frequencies were unusually close, 112', '7 MHz for Maputo and 112', ""3\xa0MHz for Matsapa, and the similarity between the figures '7' and '3' on the Soviet instrumentation"", '  The board considered it ""quite likely"" that after the turn the captain re-tuned first VOR receiver to the ILS frequency, as the instrument was found in this state after the crash', ' For the final stages of flight, the aircraft was not following any VOR signal; instead the autopilot was tracking the 221° heading the navigator had set earlier during the turn', "" The post-accident settings of the second VOR receiver showed that it was displaying the aeroplane's position relative to Maputo and was correctly set to the Maputo VOR frequency, but was apparently not being used to guide the autopilot nor was it being monitored by the crew"", ""  The captain's initial erroneous assumption that Maputo had suffered an electrical blackout was never reconsidered by the crew, despite evidence to the contrary"", ' Throughout the descent the crew were in radio contact with the Maputo controller, who therefore had electrical power, and backup power generators were standard equipment for airport navigational aids', ' All the navigation aids at Maputo were determined by the board to be working at the time of the accident, although the aircraft was flying too far away and too low to receive the ILS and NDB signals', ' When announcing the distance remaining to Maputo the navigator was apparently referring to the Doppler navigation system, which was not accurate, rather than the DME equipment available on board which correctly displayed the distance to the Maputo DME beacon', '  The crew were criticized for failing to perform any checklist items or navigational aid identification, as well as for the distractions and non-essential conversations in the cockpit during the descent into Maputo', ' As a consequence of not announcing to the other crew members which navigational aids were being used, or the frequencies being set, mistakes could not be corrected by others through ""cross-checking""', ' Regarding it essential that the relatively large crew in the cockpit work as a well-integrated team, the board concluded that ""demonstrably they had not""', '  The board found that use of non-standard phraseology between the Maputo controller and the crew led to confusion about the status of the ILS signal and whether the runway lights were on', ' The flight crew\'s repeated requests to ""check runway lights"" were interpreted by the controller, based on the use of the word \'check\' in civil aviation, as confirmation by the crew that they had the runway lights in sight', ' The aircraft had not refueled at Mbala before departing and did not have enough fuel remaining to reach the intended alternative airport in Beira, Mozambique by the time it reached Maputo', ' This may have greatly increased the pressure on the crew to continue with the landing approach to Maputo despite the difficulties encountered', '  Although the Maputo controller had specifically cleared the aircraft only to  and no lower until the runway lights were in sight, the descent continued below that height at a rate of , without the runway lights visible, in darkness and partially cloudy conditions', ' The only reaction to the warning by the GPWS, which sounded for 32 seconds, was the captain exclaiming ""Damn it!"" and a very slight nose-up pitch of the aircraft', ' The board concluded that even just seconds before the impact had the crew performed the required procedures for a GPWS alert when flying over hilly or unknown terrain, quickly raising the nose and increasing power, this would have prevented the crash', ' The captain was singled out for criticism by the board for the decision to continue the descent without any ground references and with the belief that all navigation aids at Maputo were not working, instead of climbing to the published minimum safe altitude for the Maputo area of  and verifying his position through other aids available, including his radar', '  Findings The board of inquiry determined that:  In addition the board issued five safety recommendations which covered the use of and recurrent training in approved terminology in ATC communications for both ground and flight crews, monitoring of crew compliance with established procedures, a proposal that CVRs retain a record of the last hour of flight, rather than the standard of 30 minutes, and the importance of maintaining navigational aids to international standards', '  The report was

thereafter', '  In 1902, with peace following the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging, the new Transvaal colony was faced with intertwined economic and political issues that need to be resolved', ' The economic issues faced included the restoration of the mining industry to pre-war levels, then growing it further with the need for extra labour, the restoration of the Boers to their lands and increasing the agricultural output of those farms', ' The political issue faced depended on what side of politics one stood on', ' The existing British administrators under Alfred Milner wished to anglicise the population through two main means', ' One by increasing the English-speaking population of the Transvaal and the other by teaching the Boer children in English with very little Dutch used, followed by self-rule', "" The Transvaal Boers' political objectives were the restoration of self-rule in the colony and the political environment to be dominated by the Boers"", '   Repatriation and reconstruction  As the war ended the British were faced with a large proportion of Boer men as prisoners of war and their families in concentration camps', ' As the British followed a scorched earth policy in the Transvaal, Boer lands, stock and farms had been destroyed', '  At the conclusion of the war, it was necessary to reconstruct a ""government"" for the new colony and this was begun with the appointment of a Resident Magistrate in every district of the colony and became District Commissioners while an Assistant Magistrate carried out the legal and magisterial duties of the area', ' Roman-Dutch law was translated into English so the law courts could continue, with some old acts repealed and a considerable amount of new law promulgated by the authorities in Johannesburg', '  The Resident Magistrate then submitted the names of three members of the district to the Governor for district commission under the magistrate', ' They would consist of one British subject, and two Boers, one from those who had surrendered early on in the war and one who had fought until the end', ' The commission would have two functions, one to provide assistance and issuing of rations, equipment, transport and plough animals to those affected by the war, secondly to investigate claims for compensation for actual damages sustained during the war', '  Repatriation depots were established in the districts and they were stocked with food, seed, agricultural equipment, transport, plough animals and stone and building material', ' The rail transport network struggled to compete with the transport of army requirement to maintain a garrison and civilian requirements to repair the colony', ' All feed for transport animals had to be brought to the depots as the process started in the winter of 1902', ' Refugees from the concentration camps and prisoners of war were returned to their districts in a system of drafts', ' At the depots, they would receive farm equipment, tents and rations to start again and transport to their destinations', ' Food rations were provided for almost a year', ' Families would receive a token grant irrespective of their ability to pay it back and additional material and equipment required were obtained via interest-free loans with small cash loans also attracting no interest, with larger loans attracting four percent interest by a mortgage', ' The loan scheme was never going to compensate a person for the actual loss experienced by the war', ' Damage and the reconstruction required varied from district to district,  In the larger towns, municipal or health boards were ""appointed"" to manage them under the resident Magistrate', ' They had limited functions and the only rates they levied were for sanitary functions', ' Within fifteen months of the end of the war, the introduction of municipal government was introduced with preparations made for fair elections based on property valuation and the creation of voters rolls with registration process explained in English and Dutch', '  Economic issues The British administrators set out to place most Boer farmers back on their land by March 1903 with nineteen million pounds spent on war damages, grants and loans', ' The administrators reformed the state agricultural departments to modernise farming in the colony which resulted in a maize and beef surplus by 1908', ' They also attempted to solve the poor white problem by settling them as tenant farmers on state land but lack of capital and labour caused the scheme to fail', ' An attempt was made to place English settlers on farmland so as to anglicise the Transvaal and increase the English-speaking population but this failed too as the policy attracted too few settlers', '  By the end of 1901, gold mining finally resumed on the Rand around Johannesburg, having virtually stopped since 1899', ' Backed by the mining magnates and the British administrators, there was a need to restart the industry but labour was required', "" Just prior to the war, white miners wages were high and magnates weren't keen to increase the wages and since black miners wages had been reduced before the war and not increased, so black labour weren't interested in working the mines"", ' Unskilled white labour was ruled out as their wages would be too high for the work done, so the mining magnates and their Chamber of Mines in 1903, sought alternative labour in the form of cheap Chinese workers', ' The legislation to import Chinese labour was introduced to the Transvaal Legislative Council on 28 December 1903 by George Farrar and was debated for 30 hours and successfully voted on after its three readings on 30 December 1903, coming into law in February 1904', ' Having been rubber-stamped by the British and mining appointed Transvaal Legislative Council it outlined extremely restrictive employment contracts for the Chinese workers and the idea had been sold via a fear campaign aimed at white miners about the need for this labour or face the possibility of loss of mining and their jobs', ' By 1906, the gold mines of the Witwatersrand were in full production and by 1907, South African gold mines represented thirty-two percent of the worlds gold output', ' By 1910, Chinese labour ended on the Witwatersrand and the restrictive job reservation laws preventing Chinese miners doing certain jobs was replicated for Black miners', '  Political issues  From the end of the war in 1902, the political administration of the Transvaal colony was controlled by members of a legislative and executive council, all appointed by the British Administrators under Alfred Milner and the Colonial Secretary in London', ' In 1903, three seats in the Transvaal Legislative council were offered to Louis Botha, Jan Smuts and Koos de la Rey, but they turned the British down', ' Due to a lack of a hearing given to the opinions of the Boer generals by the English administrators concerning Chinese mine labour, due to a belief they did not represent the Boer population, and the want of self-rule, garnered Louis Botha and others to meet in 1904 at a Volkskongres', ' The result of this people congress was the unification of the Boer political movement in the Transvaal into a new party called Het Volk in January 1905 by Louis Botha and Jan Smuts', "" This new party's objective was to seek reconciliation with Britain, which would be favoured by the British opposition Liberal Party, and Boer self-rule for the Transvaal"", '  English political movements included the Transvaal Responsible Government Association, the Transvaal Progressive Association and labour groups under an Industrial Labour Party', ' The Transvaal Responsible Government Association was formed in late 1904 by E', 'P Solomon and made up of loose gathering of ex-colonial and ZAR officials and diamond mining magnates, labour and businessmen', ' They called for the allowance of the colony to create its own policy and strive for self-government and the party would eventually be renamed the Nationalists', ' The Transvaal Progressive Association, formed in November 1904 and active from February 1905, had a similar membership but was linked to the mining industry opposed self-rule and preferred a legislature nominated by the High Commissioner with strong links to Britain', ' They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick', '  The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later in February 1907 an election was held with Het Volk running on two issues; Chinese labour needing to be ended when new labour sources were found and reconciliation with Britain with which they hoped would attract the English labourer vote as well as selling themselves as an alternative to the mining capitalistic Progressive Party', '   1907 election   The election was held on 20 February 1907 and Het Volk won the election gathering 37 of 69 seats', ' It stood 43 candidates and won 34 seats outright, all the country seats were gained bar Barberton, three seats in Pretoria and four on the Witwatersrand with three independents aligning themselves with the party', ' The Progressive Party stood 34 candidates and won 21 seats, twenty on the Witwatersrand and one in Pretoria with five Randlords winning seats', ' Other parties included the Nationalists (old Transvaal Responsible Government Association) that won 6 seats, four on the Witwatersrand and two in Pretoria but their leader Richard Solomon failed to win his seat', '  The Transvaal Independent Labour Party won three seats in the Witwatersrand after contesting 14, but their leader Frederic Creswell failed to gain a seat', '  Louis Botha became Prime Minister of the Transvaal and Agriculture minister with Jan Smuts as its colonial secretary', ' Other new cabinet ministers included J de Villiers, Attorney-General and Mines, Henry Charles Hull, Treasurer, Johann Rissik, Land and Native Affairs, Harry Solomon held Public Works and Edward Rooth as whip', ' The Progressives in opposition would be led by George Farrar

gathering of representatives from all four colonies and decide on a customs and railways agreement and included a proposal that the colonies appoint delegates to discuss a constitution for a united country in the form of a National Convention', ' The objective of the convention was to find a solution to the political, racial and economic problems encountered by these colonies and find common ground between Boer and the English', ' On 12 October 1908, the thirty white delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers', ' Twelve delegates came from the Cape Colony, eight from the Transvaal and five each from the Orange River and Natal Colonies representing a gathering of sixteen from an English background and the remaining fourteen were of Boer origin', '  The main issues discussed was whether the four colonies would become a country made up of a union or a federation', ' Who would be allowed to vote and the number of voters who would make-up a constituency in a rural and urban seat', ' All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and

Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races', ' A compromise was reached and all the colonies wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement was accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament', ' As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents', ' This system for the constituencies would ensure that the Afrikaner would dominate politics in years to come and would be one of the many reasons why Jan Smuts would lose the 1948 election, sweeping D', 'F', ' Malan to power and the beginning of Apartheid',

superiority and thought the black man was not ready to rule and had similarly persuaded the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain to allow a future united white government to decide the question of

hearings at the Supreme Court in Johannesburg from 20 January until 26 January 1987', ' The board then adjourned to analyze the evidence and reach conclusions as to cause', ""  Analysis The board concluded that the 37° turn was executed by the navigator using the autopilot's Doppler navigation mode, which when set maintained the desired heading while making corrections for wind drift"", ' The navigator performed this turn after he saw the VOR signal indicating that the aircraft had intercepted the Maputo VOR 45° radial, the compass direction from Maputo on which the crew intended to turn and approach for a landing on runway 23', ' However the turn actually put the aircraft on a path following a 45° radial from the VOR beacon at Matsapa Airport, Swaziland', '  Discounting the possibility of a false VOR beacon, an analysis of which was included in an appendix, the board considered it probable that the flight crew had inadvertently set the first of two VOR receivers on board to the Matsapa VOR frequency', ' This error was made more likely by the poor design of the instruments, the absence of back lighting of the selected frequencies, the fact the two frequencies were unusually close, 112', '7 MHz for Maputo and 112', ""3\xa0MHz for Matsapa, and the similarity between the figures '7' and '3' on the Soviet instrumentation"", '  The board considered it ""quite likely"" that after the turn the captain re-tuned first VOR receiver to the ILS frequency, as the instrument was found in this state after the crash', ' For the final stages of flight, the aircraft was not following any VOR signal; instead the autopilot was tracking the 221° heading the navigator had set earlier during the turn', "" The post-accident settings of the second VOR receiver showed that it was displaying the aeroplane's position relative to Maputo and was correctly set to the Maputo VOR frequency, but was apparently not being used to guide the autopilot nor was it being monitored by the crew"", ""  The captain's initial erroneous assumption that Maputo had suffered an electrical blackout was never reconsidered by the crew, despite evidence to the contrary"", ' Throughout the descent the crew were in radio contact with the Maputo controller, who therefore had electrical power, and backup power generators were standard equipment for airport navigational aids', ' All the navigation aids at Maputo were determined by the board to be working at the time of the accident, although the aircraft was flying too far away and too low to receive the ILS and NDB signals', ' When announcing the distance remaining to Maputo the navigator was apparently referring to the Doppler navigation system, which was not accurate, rather than the DME equipment available on board which correctly displayed the distance to the Maputo DME beacon', '  The crew were criticized for failing to perform any checklist items or navigational aid identification, as well as for the distractions and non-essential conversations in the cockpit during the descent into Maputo', ' As a consequence of not announcing to the other crew members which navigational aids were being used, or the frequencies being set, mistakes could not be corrected by others through ""cross-checking""', ' Regarding it essential that the relatively large crew in the cockpit work as a well-integrated team, the board concluded that ""demonstrably they had not""', '  The board found that use of non-standard phraseology between the Maputo controller and the crew led to confusion about the status of the ILS signal and whether the runway lights were on', ' The flight crew\'s repeated requests to ""check runway lights"" were interpreted by the controller, based on the use of the word \'check\' in civil aviation, as confirmation by the crew that they had the runway lights in sight', ' The aircraft had not refueled at Mbala before departing and did not have enough fuel remaining to reach the intended alternative airport in Beira, Mozambique by the time it reached Maputo', ' This may have greatly increased the pressure on the crew to continue with the landing approach to Maputo despite the difficulties encountered', '  Although the Maputo controller had specifically cleared the aircraft only to  and no lower until the runway lights were in sight, the descent continued below that height at a rate of , without the runway lights visible, in darkness and partially cloudy conditions', ' The only reaction to the warning by the GPWS, which sounded for 32 seconds, was the captain exclaiming ""Damn it!"" and a very slight nose-up pitch of the aircraft', ' The board concluded that even just seconds before the impact had the crew performed the required procedures for a GPWS alert when flying over hilly or unknown terrain, quickly raising the nose and increasing power, this would have prevented the crash', ' The captain was singled out for criticism by the board for the decision to continue the descent without any ground references and with the belief that all navigation aids at Maputo were not working, instead of climbing to the published minimum safe altitude for the Maputo area of  and verifying his position through other aids available, including his radar', '  Findings The board of inquiry determined that:  In addition the board issued five safety recommendations which covered the use of and recurrent training in approved terminology in ATC communications for both ground and flight crews, monitoring of crew compliance with established procedures, a proposal that CVRs retain a record of the last hour of flight, rather than the standard of 30 minutes, and the importance of maintaining navigational aids to international standards', '  The report was

hearings at the Supreme Court in Johannesburg from 20 January until 26 January 1987', ' The board then adjourned to analyze the evidence and reach conclusions as to cause', ""  Analysis The board concluded that the 37° turn was executed by the navigator using the autopilot's Doppler navigation mode, which when set maintained the desired heading while making corrections for wind drift"", ' The navigator performed this turn after he saw the VOR signal indicating that the aircraft had intercepted the Maputo VOR 45° radial, the compass direction from Maputo on which the crew intended to turn and approach for a landing on runway 23', ' However the turn actually put the aircraft on a path following a 45° radial from the VOR beacon at Matsapa Airport, Swaziland', '  Discounting the possibility of a false VOR beacon, an analysis of which was included in an appendix, the board considered it probable that the flight crew had inadvertently set the first of two VOR receivers on board to the Matsapa VOR frequency', ' This error was made more likely by the poor design of the instruments, the absence of back lighting of the selected frequencies, the fact the two frequencies were unusually close, 112', '7 MHz for Maputo and 112', ""3\xa0MHz for Matsapa, and the similarity between the figures '7' and '3' on the Soviet instrumentation"", '  The board considered it ""quite likely"" that after the turn the captain re-tuned first VOR receiver to the ILS frequency, as the instrument was found in this state after the crash', ' For the final stages of flight, the aircraft was not following any VOR signal; instead the autopilot was tracking the 221° heading the navigator had set earlier during the turn', "" The post-accident settings of the second VOR receiver showed that it was displaying the aeroplane's position relative to Maputo and was correctly set to the Maputo VOR frequency, but was apparently not being used to guide the autopilot nor was it being monitored by the crew"", ""  The captain's initial erroneous assumption that Maputo had suffered an electrical blackout was never reconsidered by the crew, despite evidence to the contrary"", ' Throughout the descent the crew were in radio contact with the Maputo controller, who therefore had electrical power, and backup power generators were standard equipment for airport navigational aids', ' All the navigation aids at Maputo were determined by the board to be working at the time of the accident, although the aircraft was flying too far away and too low to receive the ILS and NDB signals', ' When announcing the distance remaining to Maputo the navigator was apparently referring to the Doppler navigation system, which was not accurate, rather than the DME equipment available on board which correctly displayed the distance to the Maputo DME beacon', '  The crew were criticized for failing to perform any checklist items or navigational aid identification, as well as for the distractions and non-essential conversations in the cockpit during the descent into Maputo', ' As a consequence of not announcing to the other crew members which navigational aids were being used, or the frequencies being set, mistakes could not be corrected by others through ""cross-checking""', ' Regarding it essential that the relatively large crew in the cockpit work as a well-integrated team, the board concluded that ""demonstrably they had not""', '  The board found that use of non-standard phraseology between the Maputo controller and the crew led to confusion about the status of the ILS signal and whether the runway lights were on', ' The flight crew\'s repeated requests to ""check runway lights"" were interpreted by the controller, based on the use of the word \'check\' in civil aviation, as confirmation by the crew that they had the runway lights in sight', ' The aircraft had not refueled at Mbala before departing and did not have enough fuel remaining to reach the intended alternative airport in Beira, Mozambique by the time it reached Maputo', ' This may have greatly increased the pressure on the crew to continue with the landing approach to Maputo despite the difficulties encountered', '  Although the Maputo controller had specifically cleared the aircraft only to  and no lower until the runway lights were in sight, the descent continued below that height at a rate of , without the runway lights visible, in darkness and partially cloudy conditions', ' The only reaction to the warning by the GPWS, which sounded for 32 seconds, was the captain exclaiming ""Damn it!"" and a very slight nose-up pitch of the aircraft', ' The board concluded that even just seconds before the impact had the crew performed the required procedures for a GPWS alert when flying over hilly or unknown terrain, quickly raising the nose and increasing power, this would have prevented the crash', ' The captain was singled out for criticism by the board for the decision to continue the descent without any ground references and with the belief that all navigation aids at Maputo were not working, instead of climbing to the published minimum safe altitude for the Maputo area of  and verifying his position through other aids available, including his radar', '  Findings The board of inquiry determined that:  In addition the board issued five safety recommendations which covered the use of and recurrent training in approved terminology in ATC communications for both ground and flight crews, monitoring of crew compliance with established procedures, a proposal that CVRs retain a record of the last hour of flight, rather than the standard of 30 minutes, and the importance of maintaining navigational aids to international standards', '  The report was

reconstruction of homes affected by the war', ' To that end, the crown agrees to a free grant of £3,000,000 as well as loans at no interest for two years to be repaid at 3 percent interest over years thereafter', '  In 1902, with peace following the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging, the new Transvaal colony was faced with intertwined economic and political issues that need to be resolved', ' The economic issues faced included the restoration of the mining industry to pre-war levels, then growing it further with the need for extra labour, the restoration of the Boers to their lands and increasing the agricultural output of those farms', ' The political issue faced depended on what side of politics one stood on', ' The existing British administrators under Alfred Milner wished to anglicise the population through two main means', ' One by increasing the English-speaking population of the Transvaal and the other by teaching the Boer children in English with very little Dutch used, followed by self-rule', "" The Transvaal Boers' political objectives were the restoration of self-rule in the colony and the political environment to be dominated by the Boers"", '   Repatriation and reconstruction  As the war ended the British were faced with a large proportion of Boer men as prisoners of war and their families in concentration camps', ' As the British followed a scorched earth policy in the Transvaal, Boer lands, stock and farms had been destroyed', '  At the conclusion of the war, it was necessary to reconstruct a ""government"" for the new colony and this was begun with the appointment of a Resident Magistrate in every district of the colony and became District Commissioners while an Assistant Magistrate carried out the legal and magisterial duties of the area', ' Roman-Dutch law was translated into English so the law courts could continue, with some old acts repealed and a considerable amount of new law promulgated by the authorities in Johannesburg', '  The Resident Magistrate then submitted the names of three members of the district to the Governor for district commission under the magistrate', ' They would consist of one British subject, and two Boers, one from those who had surrendered early on in the war and one who had fought until the end', ' The commission would have two functions, one to provide assistance and issuing of rations, equipment, transport and plough animals to those affected by the war, secondly to investigate claims for compensation for actual damages sustained during the war', '  Repatriation depots were established in the districts and they were stocked with food, seed, agricultural equipment, transport, plough animals and stone and building material', ' The rail transport network struggled to compete with the transport of army requirement to maintain a garrison and civilian requirements to repair the colony', ' All feed for transport animals had to be brought to the depots as the process started in the winter of 1902', ' Refugees from the concentration camps and prisoners of war were returned to their districts in a system of drafts', ' At the depots, they would receive farm equipment, tents and rations to start again and transport to their destinations', ' Food rations were provided for almost a year', ' Families would receive a token grant irrespective of their ability to pay it back and additional material and equipment required were obtained via interest-free loans with small cash loans also attracting no interest, with larger loans attracting four percent interest by a mortgage', ' The loan scheme was never going to compensate a person for the actual loss experienced by the war', ' Damage and the reconstruction required varied from district to district,  In the larger towns, municipal or health boards were ""appointed"" to manage them under the resident Magistrate', ' They had limited functions and the only rates they levied were for sanitary functions', ' Within fifteen months of the end of the war, the introduction of municipal government was introduced with preparations made for fair elections based on property valuation and the creation of voters rolls with registration process explained in English and Dutch', '  Economic issues The British administrators set out to place most Boer farmers back on their land by March 1903 with nineteen million pounds spent on war damages, grants and loans', ' The administrators reformed the state agricultural departments to modernise farming in the colony which resulted in a maize and beef surplus by 1908', ' They also attempted to solve the poor white problem by settling them as tenant farmers on state land but lack of capital and labour caused the scheme to fail', ' An attempt was made to place English settlers on farmland so as to anglicise the Transvaal and increase the English-speaking population but this failed too as the policy attracted too few settlers', '  By the end of 1901, gold mining finally resumed on the Rand around Johannesburg, having virtually stopped since 1899', ' Backed by the mining magnates and the British administrators, there was a need to restart the industry but labour was required', "" Just prior to the war, white miners wages were high and magnates weren't keen to increase the wages and since black miners wages had been reduced before the war and not increased, so black labour weren't interested in working the mines"", ' Unskilled white labour was ruled out as their wages would be too high for the work done, so the mining magnates and their Chamber of Mines in 1903, sought alternative labour in the form of cheap Chinese workers', ' The legislation to import Chinese labour was introduced to the Transvaal Legislative Council on 28 December 1903 by George Farrar and was debated for 30 hours and successfully voted on after its three readings on 30 December 1903, coming into law in February 1904', ' Having been rubber-stamped by the British and mining appointed Transvaal Legislative Council it outlined extremely restrictive employment contracts for the Chinese workers and the idea had been sold via a fear campaign aimed at white miners about the need for this labour or face the possibility of loss of mining and their jobs', ' By 1906, the gold mines of the Witwatersrand were in full production and by 1907, South African gold mines represented thirty-two percent of the worlds gold output', ' By 1910, Chinese labour ended on the Witwatersrand and the restrictive job reservation laws preventing Chinese miners doing certain jobs was replicated for Black miners', '  Political issues  From the end of the war in 1902, the political administration of the Transvaal colony was controlled by members of a legislative and executive council, all appointed by the British Administrators under Alfred Milner and the Colonial Secretary in London', ' In 1903, three seats in the Transvaal Legislative council were offered to Louis Botha, Jan Smuts and Koos de la Rey, but they turned the British down', ' Due to a lack of a hearing given to the opinions of the Boer generals by the English administrators concerning Chinese mine labour, due to a belief they did not represent the Boer population, and the want of self-rule, garnered Louis Botha and others to meet in 1904 at a Volkskongres', ' The result of this people congress was the unification of the Boer political movement in the Transvaal into a new party called Het Volk in January 1905 by Louis Botha and Jan Smuts', "" This new party's objective was to seek reconciliation with Britain, which would be favoured by the British opposition Liberal Party, and Boer self-rule for the Transvaal"", '  English political movements included the Transvaal Responsible Government Association, the Transvaal Progressive Association and labour groups under an Industrial Labour Party', ' The Transvaal Responsible Government Association was formed in late 1904 by E', 'P Solomon and made up of loose gathering of ex-colonial and ZAR officials and diamond mining magnates, labour and businessmen', ' They called for the allowance of the colony to create its own policy and strive for self-government and the party would eventually be renamed the Nationalists', ' The Transvaal Progressive Association, formed in November 1904 and active from February 1905, had a similar membership but was linked to the mining industry opposed self-rule and preferred a legislature nominated by the High Commissioner with strong links to Britain', ' They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick', '  The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later in February 1907 an election was held with Het Volk running on two issues; Chinese labour needing to be ended when new labour sources were found and reconciliation with Britain with which they hoped would attract the English labourer vote as well as selling themselves as an alternative to the mining capitalistic Progressive Party', '   1907 election   The election was held on 20 February 1907 and Het Volk won the election gathering 37 of 69 seats', ' It stood 43 candidates and won 34 seats outright, all the country seats were gained bar Barberton, three seats in Pretoria and four on the Witwatersrand with three independents aligning themselves with the party', ' The Progressive Party stood 34 candidates and won 21 seats, twenty on the Witwatersrand and one in Pretoria with five Randlords winning seats', ' Other parties included the Nationalists (old Transvaal Responsible Government Association) that won 6 seats, four on the Witwatersrand and two in Pretoria but their leader Richard Solomon failed to win his seat', '  The Transvaal Independent Labour Party won three seats in the Witwatersrand after contesting 14, but their leader Frederic Creswell failed to gain a seat', '  Louis Botha became Prime Minister of the Transvaal and Agriculture minister with Jan Smuts as its colonial secretary', ' Other new cabinet ministers included J de Villiers, Attorney-General and Mines, Henry Charles Hull, Treasurer, Johann Rissik, Land and Native Affairs, Harry Solomon held Public Works and Edward Rooth as whip', ' The Progressives in opposition would be led by George Farrar and Abe Bailey as the opposition whip', ' They all assembled for the first time in March 1907', ' After the 1907 election, the issue of Chinese mining labour was revisited with Het Volk believing there was enough labour in the form of black and white miners', ' Taking into account the economic interests of the Transvaal, Botha ensured a gradual policy of repatriation of Chinese labour', '  By 1908, the Boers had won in elections, control of Natal, Orange River and Transvaal colonies, but under British influence with the need now to unite the country under one government', '   Progression to Union  [[File:Spelterini Transvaal', 'jpg|thumb|200px|Aerial photography of gold mines, taken by Eduard Spelterini in July 1911]] In May 1908, Jan Smuts, Transvaal Colonial Secretary proposed a gathering of representatives from all four colonies and decide on a customs and railways agreement and included a proposal that the colonies appoint delegates to discuss a constitution for a united country in the form of a National Convention', ' The objective of the convention was to find a solution to the political, racial and economic problems encountered by these colonies and find common ground between Boer and the English', ' On 12 October 1908, the thirty white delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers', ' Twelve delegates came from the Cape Colony, eight from the Transvaal and five each from the Orange River and Natal Colonies representing a gathering of sixteen from an English background and the remaining fourteen were of Boer origin', '  The main issues discussed was whether the four colonies would become a country made up of a union or a federation', ' Who would be allowed to vote and the number of voters who would make-up a constituency in a rural and urban seat', ' All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and Jan Smuts', ' On the question of black enfranchisement, the British government was prepared to accept the final wishes of the National Convention', ' The colonies of the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races', ' A compromise was reached and all the colonies wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement was accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament', ' As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents', ' This system for the constituencies would ensure that the Afrikaner would dominate politics in years to come and would be one of the many reasons why Jan Smuts would lose the 1948 election, sweeping D', 'F', ' Malan to power and the beginning of Apartheid', ' The results of the negotiations at the Convention became the draft South Africa Act which was released for viewing on 9 February 1909', ' By 19 August 1909, the South Africa Act passed through the Houses of Commons and into law', '  As to the question of black enfranchisement, the views of British and Boers were similar with Alfred Milner stating in a speech in 1903, that he believed in white superiority and thought the black man was not ready to rule and had similarly persuaded the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain to allow a future united white government to decide the question of the black franchise', '  Colonial Administration  Prior to the grant of responsible self-government on 6 December 1906, the Colony was administered by an Executive Council appointed by the Governor',

for war expenses and to honor script issued by the countries of the ZAR and Orange Free State during the period of the war', ' The commission would also feed the homeless and assist with the reconstruction of homes affected by the war', ' To that end, the crown agrees to a free grant of £3,000,000 as well as loans at no interest for two years to be repaid at 3 percent interest over years thereafter', '  In 1902, with peace following the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging, the new Transvaal colony was faced with intertwined economic and political issues that need to be resolved', ' The economic issues faced included the restoration of the mining industry to pre-war levels, then growing it further with the need for extra labour, the restoration of the Boers to their lands and increasing the agricultural output of those farms', ' The political issue faced depended on what side of politics one stood on', ' The existing British administrators under Alfred Milner wished to anglicise the population through two main means', ' One by increasing the English-speaking population of the Transvaal and the other by teaching the Boer children in English with very little Dutch used, followed by self-rule', "" The Transvaal Boers' political objectives were the restoration of self-rule in the colony and the political environment to be dominated by the Boers"", '   Repatriation and reconstruction  As the war ended the British were faced with a large proportion of Boer men as prisoners of war and their families in concentration camps', ' As the British followed a scorched earth policy in the Transvaal, Boer lands, stock and farms had been destroyed', '  At the conclusion of the war, it was necessary to reconstruct a ""government"" for the new colony and this was begun with the appointment of a Resident Magistrate in every district of the colony and became District Commissioners while an Assistant Magistrate carried out the legal and magisterial duties of the area', ' Roman-Dutch law was translated into English so the law courts could continue, with some old acts repealed and a considerable amount of new law promulgated by the authorities in Johannesburg', '  The Resident Magistrate then submitted the names of three members of the district to the Governor for district commission under the magistrate', ' They would consist of one British subject, and two Boers, one from those who had surrendered early on in the war and one who had fought until the end', ' The commission would have two functions, one to provide assistance and issuing of rations, equipment, transport and plough animals to those affected by the war, secondly to investigate claims for compensation for actual damages sustained during the war', '  Repatriation depots were established in the districts and they were stocked with food, seed, agricultural equipment, transport, plough animals and stone and building material', ' The rail transport network struggled to compete with the transport of army requirement to maintain a garrison and civilian requirements to repair the colony', ' All feed for transport animals had to be brought to the depots as the process started in the winter of 1902', ' Refugees from the concentration camps and prisoners of war were returned to their districts in a system of drafts', ' At the depots, they would receive farm equipment, tents and rations to start again and transport to their destinations', ' Food rations were provided for almost a year', ' Families would receive a token grant irrespective of their ability to pay it back and additional material and equipment required were obtained via interest-free loans with small cash loans also attracting no interest, with larger loans attracting four percent interest by a mortgage', ' The loan scheme was never going to compensate a person for the actual loss experienced by the war', ' Damage and the reconstruction required varied from district to district,  In the larger towns, municipal or health boards were ""appointed"" to manage them under the resident Magistrate', ' They had limited functions and the only rates they levied were for sanitary functions', ' Within fifteen months of the end of the war, the introduction of municipal government was introduced with preparations made for fair elections based on property valuation and the creation of voters rolls with registration process explained in English and Dutch', '  Economic issues The British administrators set out to place most Boer farmers back on their land by March 1903 with nineteen million pounds spent on war damages, grants and loans', ' The administrators reformed the state agricultural departments to modernise farming in the colony which resulted in a maize and beef surplus by 1908', ' They also attempted to solve the poor white problem by settling them as tenant farmers on state land but lack of capital and labour caused the scheme to fail', ' An attempt was made to place English settlers on farmland so as to anglicise the Transvaal and increase the English-speaking population but this failed too as the policy attracted too few settlers', '  By the end of 1901, gold mining finally resumed on the Rand around Johannesburg, having virtually stopped since 1899', ' Backed by the mining magnates and the British administrators, there was a need to restart the industry but labour was required', "" Just prior to the war, white miners wages were high and magnates weren't keen to increase the wages and since black miners wages had been reduced before the war and not increased, so black labour weren't interested in working the mines"", ' Unskilled white labour was ruled out as their wages would be too high for the work done, so the mining magnates and their Chamber of Mines in 1903, sought alternative labour in the form of cheap Chinese workers', ' The legislation to import Chinese labour was introduced to the Transvaal Legislative Council on 28 December 1903 by George Farrar and was debated for 30 hours and successfully voted on after its three readings on 30 December 1903, coming into law in February 1904', ' Having been rubber-stamped by the British and mining appointed Transvaal Legislative Council it outlined extremely restrictive employment contracts for the Chinese workers and the idea had been sold via a fear campaign aimed at white miners about the need for this labour or face the possibility of loss of mining and their jobs', ' By 1906, the gold mines of the Witwatersrand were in full production and by 1907, South African gold mines represented thirty-two percent of the worlds gold output', ' By 1910, Chinese labour ended on the Witwatersrand and the restrictive job reservation laws preventing Chinese miners doing certain jobs was replicated for Black miners', '  Political issues  From the end of the war in 1902, the political administration of the Transvaal colony was controlled by members of a legislative and executive council, all appointed by the British Administrators under Alfred Milner and the Colonial Secretary in London', ' In 1903, three seats in the Transvaal Legislative council were offered to Louis Botha, Jan Smuts and Koos de la Rey, but they turned the British down', ' Due to a lack of a hearing given to the opinions of the Boer generals by the English administrators concerning Chinese mine labour, due to a belief they did not represent the Boer population, and the want of self-rule, garnered Louis Botha and others to meet in 1904 at a Volkskongres', ' The result of this people congress was the unification of the Boer political movement in the Transvaal into a new party called Het Volk in January 1905 by Louis Botha and Jan Smuts', "" This new party's objective was to seek reconciliation with Britain, which would be favoured by the British opposition Liberal Party, and Boer self-rule for the Transvaal"", '  English political movements included the Transvaal Responsible Government Association, the Transvaal Progressive Association and labour groups under an Industrial Labour Party', ' The Transvaal Responsible Government Association was formed in late 1904 by E', 'P Solomon and made up of loose gathering of ex-colonial and ZAR officials and diamond mining magnates, labour and businessmen', ' They called for the allowance of the colony to create its own policy and strive for self-government and the party would eventually be renamed the Nationalists', ' The Transvaal Progressive Association, formed in November 1904 and active from February 1905, had a similar membership but was linked to the mining industry opposed self-rule and preferred a legislature nominated by the High Commissioner with strong links to Britain', ' They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick', '  The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later in February 1907 an election was held with Het Volk running on two issues; Chinese labour needing to be ended when new labour sources were found and reconciliation with Britain with which they hoped would attract the English labourer vote as well as selling themselves as an alternative to the mining capitalistic Progressive Party', '   1907 election   The election was held on 20 February 1907 and Het Volk won the election gathering 37 of 69 seats', ' It stood 43 candidates and won 34 seats outright, all the country seats were gained bar Barberton, three seats in Pretoria and four on the Witwatersrand with three independents aligning themselves with the party', ' The Progressive Party stood 34 candidates and won 21 seats, twenty on the Witwatersrand and one in Pretoria with five Randlords winning seats', ' Other parties included the Nationalists (old Transvaal Responsible Government Association) that won 6 seats, four on the Witwatersrand and two in Pretoria but their leader Richard Solomon failed to win his seat', '  The Transvaal Independent Labour Party won three seats in the Witwatersrand after contesting 14, but their leader Frederic Creswell failed to gain a seat', '  Louis Botha became Prime Minister of the Transvaal and Agriculture minister with Jan Smuts as its colonial secretary', ' Other new cabinet ministers included J de Villiers, Attorney-General and Mines, Henry Charles Hull, Treasurer, Johann Rissik, Land and Native Affairs, Harry Solomon held Public Works and Edward Rooth as whip', ' The Progressives in opposition would be led by George Farrar and Abe Bailey as the opposition whip', ' They all assembled for the first time in March 1907', ' After the 1907 election, the issue of Chinese mining labour was revisited with Het Volk believing there was enough labour in the form of black and white miners', ' Taking into account the economic interests of the Transvaal, Botha ensured a gradual policy of repatriation of Chinese labour', '  By 1908, the Boers had won in elections, control of Natal, Orange River and Transvaal colonies, but under British influence with the need now to unite the country under one government', '   Progression to Union  [[File:Spelterini Transvaal', 'jpg|thumb|200px|Aerial photography of gold mines, taken by Eduard Spelterini in July 1911]] In May 1908, Jan Smuts, Transvaal Colonial Secretary proposed a gathering of representatives from all four colonies and decide on a customs and railways agreement and included a proposal that the colonies appoint delegates to discuss a constitution for a united country in the form of a National Convention', ' The objective of the convention was to find a solution to the political, racial and economic problems encountered by these colonies and find common ground between Boer and the English', ' On 12 October 1908, the thirty white delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers', ' Twelve delegates came from the Cape Colony, eight from the Transvaal and five each from the Orange River and Natal Colonies representing a gathering of sixteen from an English background and the remaining fourteen were of Boer origin', '  The main issues discussed was whether the four colonies would become a country made up of a union or a federation', ' Who would be allowed to vote and the number of voters who would make-up a constituency in a rural and urban seat', ' All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and Jan Smuts', ' On the question of black enfranchisement, the British government was prepared to accept the final wishes of the National Convention', ' The colonies of the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races', ' A compromise was reached and all the colonies wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement was accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament', ' As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents', ' This system for the constituencies would ensure that the Afrikaner would dominate politics in years to come and would be one of the many reasons why Jan Smuts would lose the 1948 election, sweeping D', 'F', ' Malan to power and the beginning of Apartheid', ' The results of the negotiations at the Convention became the draft South Africa Act which was released for viewing on 9 February 1909', ' By 19 August 1909, the South Africa Act passed through the Houses of Commons and into law', '  As to the question of black enfranchisement, the views of British and Boers were similar with Alfred Milner stating in a speech in 1903, that he believed in white superiority and thought the black man was not ready to rule and had similarly persuaded the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain to allow a future united white government to decide the question of the black franchise', '  Colonial Administration  Prior to the grant of responsible self-government on 6 December 1906, the Colony was administered by an Executive Council appointed by the Governor',

turn said returning the artwork required the consent of the full membership', ' The officer corps there said that even though South Africa would volunteer to complete the task, they were unwilling to part with a memento of the ""brave and honourable men"" whom they fought against in 1899-1902 and fought alongside in 1914–1918; they also treasured the donation from the late Lord Kitchener (who had died in 1916), whom they held ""in special regard and honour', '"" Therefore, copies made at South Africa\'s expense were all the nation would get', '  While the public campaign to return the statue

architecturally out of step with Church Square, a matter probed by two architects (Gordon Leith and Vivian Sydney Rees-Poole) and their colleagues from the Kruger Society', ' It turned out that the Council preferred the southern entrance of the Square as a location for the statue, while the Society favored the center', "" Van Wouw took the Kruger Society's position in two firm letters stating:

the designated place and there it must be built', '  In his other letter, Van Wouw claimed that Kruger himself had personally told the artist in the presence of several Volksraad members that it belonged at that location', '  Van Wouw\'s letter came to naught, and the issue was dropped until Gerard Moerdijk, architect of the Voortrekker Monument, suggested placing the statue near the southern entrance to Church Square as the ""psychological center"" to what he envisioned as a kind of amphitheater, as the pulpit of a church would be', ' An honorary stele and bell tower would be built behind the statue, with the Boer figures on the sides rather than around the base of the Kruger statue', "" The Kruger Society approved the plan, while the City Council suggested an open national competition

Kitchener sent the sculptures off on the first ship home with two exceptions: a chest containing the Kruger sculpture and a wooden model of a gun, of no interest to Kitchener, which stayed in the

The British aimed in the Second Boer War, in the words of Sir Alfred Milner, ""to wipe out the last trace of Afrikanerism,"" but in 1906 (four years after the end of the war), Afrikaners managed to elect their own government', ' Kruger died in 1904, and the Transvaal Colony elected Botha, Commandant-General in the War and then leader of Het Volk, as its Prime Minister, a post in which he would continue from 1910 on for South Africa at large', "" Botha petitioned Kitchener to return the four sentinels and the panels to South Africa to accompany the statue in Church Square, but Kitchener claimed he couldn't return those in his possession, claiming they were not spoils of war but a gift from Marks"", ' The Pretoria City Council turned to Marks, Van Wouw, and finally Kitchener, but none of them could find the missing statue', '  After two years of research, the City Council once again asked Marks if he could release the Kruger statue, still stored in Lourenço Marques, for construction; Marks insisted he would only do so when the Council agreed to complete the entire monument according to his initial design', "" The City Council decided to simply recast the missing Boers and panels on the advice of Fanie Eloff, who said it could be done for a mere £380, but while they appropriated £500 for Van Wouw's missing material, they found the plaster casts and sketches unavailable"", ' This left taking bronze casts of the English originals to reforge as the only remaining option, one beyond the means of the Council at an estimated cost of at least £1,760', "" Once again reaching out to Marks, the Council finally won his agreement to put Kruger up on the pedestal in Prince's Park"", '  On May 24, 1913, Victoria Day, Gen', ' Schalk Willem Burger, President while Kruger was in Europe from 1900 to 1902, unveiled the statue to the public', ' Both former Orange Free State President Martinus Theunis Steyn and Botha were absent, the former due to illness and the latter to attend to urgent parliamentary matters', ' The unveiling coincided with an agriculture fair and was attended by 3,000 citizens', ' At the ceremony, Burger expressed it hope that the statue would one day take its ""rightful place"" in Church Square, and Andries Daniël Wynand Wolmarans proclaimed that: ""I sincerely wish, from my heart and for my people, that this statue be moved to Church Square, to the center of the city, so it can take the place it deserves', ' There should also be an effort to bring back the missing pieces to South Africa, for one can only understand what Kruger means to his people when he is surrounded by sturdy Boers', '"" Botha contacted Kitchener once more to return the four other figures, to which he agreed to ""willingly"" return the two he owned ""to meet the wish of the people of South Africa,"" but only in return for copies; the two owned by the Royal Engineers were not his to return, but the Union of South Africa government was free to produce replicas of them at its own expense', '  Botha was willing to accept this arrangement, but at a cost of £520 per statue for a total of £2,080, he let the issue go', ' In 1917, Botha had to visit London briefly and was asked by the Mayor to try and secure the statues again, but Botha explained that he had been negotiating for four years in vain with Kitchener and did not wish to continue doing so', "" The Council once again sought Marks' help to no avail"", ' In August 1920, Edward P', ' Mathers, editor of the newspaper South Africa, began a press campaign to return the statue with the help of former President Francis William Reitz', ' Mathers discovered where the missing sculptures were, published the photos in his paper, and asked the Mayor of Chatham to pressure his City Council to help return the two figures there to South Africa, given that  ""as they remain at present they are a menace to the good relationships which I am sure Chatham as all England wishes to be established and preserved between them and the Dutch of South Africa', '"" Mathers also pointed out that South Africa and England had fought on the same side in World War I and that ""spoils of conquest"" from Afrikaners should be replaced with ""trophies of our enemies"" there', ' The Mayor of Chatham replied that the statues belonged not to the Council but to the Royal Engineers, who in turn said returning the artwork required the consent of the full membership', ' The officer corps there said that even though South Africa would volunteer to complete the task, they were unwilling to part with a memento of the ""brave and honourable men"" whom they fought against in 1899-1902 and fought alongside in 1914–1918; they also treasured the donation from the late Lord Kitchener (who had died in 1916), whom they held ""in special regard and honour', '"" Therefore, copies made at South Africa\'s expense were all the nation would get', '  While the public campaign to return the statue

the Sons of England, the New Guard, and the Hatfield Ratepayers Association joined the effort', ' The City Council stalled, hoping interest would flag, but on March 9, 1939, the Transvaal Provincial Council unanimously motioned for the City Council to solve the matter definitively, and on May 29, the majority of the latter agreed to relocate the statue at no cost to them', '  The Chairman of the

the designated place and there it must be built', '  In his other letter, Van Wouw claimed that Kruger himself had personally told the artist in the presence of several Volksraad members that it belonged at that location', '  Van Wouw\'s letter came to naught, and the issue was dropped until Gerard Moerdijk, architect of the Voortrekker Monument, suggested placing the statue near the southern entrance to Church Square as the ""psychological center"" to what he envisioned as a kind of amphitheater, as the pulpit of a church would be', ' An honorary stele and bell tower would be built behind the statue, with the Boer figures on the sides rather than around the base of the Kruger statue', "" The Kruger Society approved the plan, while the City Council suggested an open national competition

The economic issues faced included the restoration of the mining industry to pre-war levels, then growing it further with the need for extra labour, the restoration of the Boers to their lands and increasing the agricultural output of those farms', ' The political issue faced depended on what side of politics one stood on', ' The existing British administrators under Alfred Milner wished to anglicise the population through two main means', ' One by increasing the English-speaking population of the Transvaal and the other by teaching the Boer children in English with very little Dutch

district,  In the larger towns, municipal or health boards were ""appointed"" to manage them under the resident Magistrate', ' They had limited functions and the only rates they levied were for sanitary functions', ' Within fifteen months of the end of the war, the introduction of municipal government was introduced with preparations made for fair elections based on property valuation and the creation of voters rolls with registration process explained in English and Dutch', '  Economic issues The British administrators set out to place most Boer farmers back on their land by March 1903 with nineteen million pounds spent on war damages, grants and loans', ' The administrators reformed the state agricultural departments to modernise farming in the colony which resulted in a maize and beef surplus by 1908', ' They also attempted to solve the poor white problem by settling them as tenant farmers on state land but lack of capital and labour caused the scheme to fail', ' An

to restart the industry but labour was required', "" Just prior to the war, white miners wages were high and magnates weren't keen to increase the wages and since black miners wages had been reduced before the war and not increased, so black labour weren't interested in working the mines"", ' Unskilled white labour was ruled out as their wages would be too high for the work done, so the mining magnates and their Chamber of Mines in 1903, sought alternative labour in the form of cheap Chinese workers', ' The legislation to import Chinese labour was introduced to the Transvaal Legislative Council on 28 December 1903 by George Farrar and was debated for 30 hours and successfully voted on after its three readings on 30 December 1903, coming into law in February 1904', ' Having been rubber-stamped by the British and mining appointed Transvaal Legislative Council it outlined extremely restrictive employment contracts for the Chinese workers and the idea had been sold via a fear

1907, South African gold mines represented thirty-two percent of the worlds gold output', ' By 1910, Chinese labour ended on the Witwatersrand and the restrictive job reservation laws preventing Chinese miners doing certain jobs was replicated for Black miners', '  Political issues  From the end of the war in 1902, the political administration of the Transvaal colony was controlled by members of a legislative and executive council, all appointed by the British Administrators under Alfred Milner and the Colonial Secretary in London', ' In 1903, three seats in the Transvaal Legislative council were offered to Louis Botha, Jan Smuts and Koos de la Rey, but they turned the British down', ' Due to a lack of a hearing given to the opinions of the Boer generals by the English administrators concerning Chinese mine labour, due to a belief they did not represent the Boer population, and the want of self-rule, garnered Louis Botha and others to meet in 1904 at a Volkskongres', ' The result of this people congress was the unification of the Boer political movement in the Transvaal into a new party called Het Volk in January 1905 by Louis Botha and Jan Smuts', "" This new party's objective was to seek reconciliation with Britain, which would be favoured by the British opposition Liberal Party, and Boer self-rule for the Transvaal"", '  English political movements included the Transvaal Responsible Government Association, the Transvaal Progressive Association and labour groups under an Industrial Labour Party', ' The Transvaal Responsible Government Association was formed in late 1904 by E', 'P Solomon and made up of loose gathering of ex-colonial and ZAR officials and diamond mining magnates, labour and businessmen', ' They called for the allowance of the colony to create its own policy and strive for self-government and the party would eventually be renamed the Nationalists', ' The Transvaal Progressive Association, formed in November 1904 and active from February 1905, had a similar membership but was linked to the mining industry opposed self-rule and preferred a legislature nominated by the High Commissioner with strong links to Britain', ' They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick', '  The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later in February 1907 an election was held with Het Volk running on two issues; Chinese labour needing to be ended when new labour sources were found and reconciliation with Britain with which they hoped would attract the English labourer vote as well as selling themselves as an alternative to the mining capitalistic Progressive Party', '   1907 election   The election was held on 20 February 1907 and

Richard Solomon failed to win his seat', '  The Transvaal Independent Labour Party won three seats in the Witwatersrand after contesting 14, but their leader Frederic Creswell failed to gain a seat',

and Abe Bailey as the opposition whip', ' They all assembled for the first time in March 1907', ' After the 1907 election, the issue of Chinese mining labour was revisited with Het Volk believing there was enough labour in the form of black and white miners', ' Taking into account the economic interests of the Transvaal, Botha ensured a gradual policy of repatriation of Chinese labour', '  By 1908, the Boers had won in elections, control of Natal, Orange River and Transvaal colonies, but under British influence with the need now to unite the country under one government', '   Progression to Union  [[File:Spelterini Transvaal', 'jpg|thumb|200px|Aerial photography of gold mines, taken by Eduard Spelterini in July 1911]] In May 1908, Jan Smuts, Transvaal Colonial Secretary proposed a gathering of representatives from all four colonies and decide on a customs and railways agreement and included a proposal that the colonies appoint delegates to discuss a constitution for a united country in the form of a National Convention', ' The objective of the convention was to find a solution to the political, racial and economic problems encountered by these colonies and find common ground between Boer and the English', ' On 12 October 1908, the thirty white delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers', ' Twelve delegates came from the Cape Colony, eight from the Transvaal and five each from the Orange River and Natal Colonies representing a gathering of sixteen from an English background and the remaining fourteen were of Boer origin', '  The main issues discussed was whether the four colonies would become a country made up of a union or a federation', ' Who would be allowed to vote and the number of voters who would make-up a constituency in a rural and urban seat', ' All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and Jan Smuts', ' On the question of black enfranchisement, the British government was prepared to accept the final wishes of the National Convention', ' The colonies of the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races', ' A compromise was reached and all the colonies wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement was accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament', ' As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents', ' This system for the constituencies would ensure that the Afrikaner would dominate politics in years to come and would be one of the many reasons why Jan Smuts would lose the 1948 election, sweeping D', 'F', ' Malan to power and the beginning of Apartheid', ' The results of the negotiations at the Convention became the draft South Africa Act which was released for viewing on 9 February 1909', ' By 19 August 1909, the South Africa Act passed through the Houses of Commons and into law', '  As to the question of black enfranchisement, the views of British and Boers were similar with Alfred Milner stating in a speech in 1903, that he believed in white superiority and thought the black man was not ready to rule and had similarly persuaded the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain to allow a future united white government to decide the question of

Britain', ' They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick', '  The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later

there was enough labour in the form of black and white miners', ' Taking into account the economic interests of the Transvaal, Botha ensured a gradual policy of repatriation of Chinese labour', '  By

ground between Boer and the English', ' On 12 October 1908, the thirty white delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers', ' Twelve delegates came from the Cape Colony, eight from the Transvaal and five each from the Orange River and Natal Colonies representing a gathering of sixteen from an English background and the remaining fourteen were of Boer origin', '  The main issues discussed was whether the four colonies would become a country made up of a union or a federation', ' Who would be allowed to vote and the number of voters who would make-up a constituency in a rural and urban seat', ' All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and Jan Smuts', ' On the question of black enfranchisement, the British government was prepared to accept the final wishes of the National Convention', ' The colonies of the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races', ' A compromise was reached and all the colonies wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement was accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament', ' As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents', ' This system for the constituencies would ensure that the

thereafter', '  In 1902, with peace following the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging, the new Transvaal colony was faced with intertwined economic and political issues that need to be resolved', ' The economic issues faced included the restoration of the mining industry to pre-war levels, then growing it further with the need for extra labour, the restoration of the Boers to their lands and increasing the agricultural output of those farms', ' The political issue faced depended on what side of politics one stood on', ' The existing British administrators under Alfred Milner wished to anglicise the population through two main means', ' One by increasing the English-speaking population of the Transvaal and the other by teaching the Boer children in English with very little Dutch used, followed by self-rule', "" The Transvaal Boers' political objectives were the restoration of self-rule in the colony and the political environment to be dominated by the Boers"", '

scorched earth policy in the Transvaal, Boer lands, stock and farms had been destroyed', '  At the conclusion of the war, it was necessary to reconstruct a ""government"" for the new colony and this

were established in the districts and they were stocked with food, seed, agricultural equipment, transport, plough animals and stone and building material', ' The rail transport network struggled to

equipment, tents and rations to start again and transport to their destinations', ' Food rations were provided for almost a year', ' Families would receive a token grant irrespective of their ability to pay it back and additional material and equipment required were obtained via interest-free loans with small cash loans also attracting no interest, with larger loans attracting four percent

district,  In the larger towns, municipal or health boards were ""appointed"" to manage them under the resident Magistrate', ' They had limited functions and the only rates they levied were for sanitary functions', ' Within fifteen months of the end of the war, the introduction of municipal government was introduced with preparations made for fair elections based on property valuation and the creation of voters rolls with registration process explained in English and Dutch', '  Economic issues The British administrators set out to place most Boer farmers back on their land by March 1903 with nineteen million pounds spent on war damages, grants and loans', ' The administrators reformed the state agricultural departments to modernise farming in the colony which resulted in a maize and beef surplus by 1908', ' They also attempted to solve the poor white problem by settling them as tenant farmers on state land but lack of capital and labour caused the scheme to fail', ' An attempt was made to place English settlers on farmland so as to anglicise the Transvaal and increase the English-speaking population but this failed too as the policy attracted too few settlers', '  By the end of 1901, gold mining finally resumed on the Rand around Johannesburg, having virtually stopped since 1899', ' Backed by the mining magnates and the British administrators, there was a need to restart the industry but labour was required', "" Just prior to the war, white miners wages were high and magnates weren't keen to increase the wages and since black miners wages had been reduced before the war and not increased, so black labour weren't interested in working the mines"", ' Unskilled white labour was ruled out as their wages would be too high for the work done, so the mining magnates and their Chamber of Mines in 1903, sought alternative labour in the form of cheap Chinese workers', ' The legislation to import Chinese labour was introduced to the Transvaal Legislative Council on 28 December 1903 by George Farrar and was debated for 30 hours and successfully voted on after its three readings on 30 December 1903, coming into law in February 1904', ' Having been rubber-stamped by the British and mining appointed Transvaal Legislative Council it outlined extremely restrictive employment contracts for the Chinese workers and the idea had been sold via a fear campaign aimed at white miners about the need for this labour or face the possibility of loss of mining and their jobs', ' By 1906, the gold mines of the Witwatersrand were in full production and by 1907, South African gold mines represented thirty-two percent of the worlds gold output', ' By 1910, Chinese labour ended on the Witwatersrand and the restrictive job reservation laws preventing Chinese miners doing certain jobs was replicated for Black miners', '  Political issues  From the end of the war in 1902, the political administration of the Transvaal colony was controlled by members of a legislative and executive council, all appointed by the British Administrators under Alfred Milner and the Colonial Secretary in London', ' In 1903, three seats in the Transvaal Legislative council were offered to Louis Botha, Jan Smuts and Koos de la Rey, but they turned the British down', ' Due to a lack of a hearing given to the opinions of the Boer generals by the English administrators concerning Chinese mine labour, due to a belief they did not represent the Boer population, and the want of self-rule, garnered Louis Botha and others to meet in 1904 at a Volkskongres', ' The result of this people congress was the unification of the Boer political movement in the Transvaal into a new party called Het Volk in January 1905 by Louis Botha and Jan Smuts', "" This new party's objective was to seek reconciliation with Britain, which would be favoured by the British opposition Liberal Party, and Boer self-rule for the Transvaal"", '  English political movements included the Transvaal Responsible Government Association, the Transvaal Progressive Association and labour groups under an Industrial Labour Party', ' The Transvaal Responsible Government Association was formed in late 1904 by E', 'P Solomon and made up of loose gathering of ex-colonial and ZAR officials and diamond mining magnates, labour and businessmen', ' They called for the allowance of the colony to create its own policy and strive for self-government and the party would eventually be renamed the Nationalists', ' The Transvaal Progressive Association, formed in November 1904 and active from February 1905, had a similar membership but was linked to the mining industry opposed self-rule and preferred a legislature nominated by the High Commissioner with strong links to Britain', ' They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick', '  The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later in February 1907 an election was held with Het Volk running on two issues; Chinese labour needing to be ended when new labour sources were found and reconciliation with Britain with which they hoped would attract the English labourer vote as well as selling themselves as an alternative to the mining capitalistic Progressive Party', '   1907 election   The election was held on 20 February 1907 and

Witwatersrand with three independents aligning themselves with the party', ' The Progressive Party stood 34 candidates and won 21 seats, twenty on the Witwatersrand and one in Pretoria with five Randlords winning seats', ' Other parties included the Nationalists (old Transvaal Responsible Government Association) that won 6 seats, four on the Witwatersrand and two in Pretoria but their leader Richard Solomon failed to win his seat', '  The Transvaal Independent Labour Party won three seats in the Witwatersrand after contesting 14, but their leader Frederic Creswell failed to gain a seat',

Mines, Henry Charles Hull, Treasurer, Johann Rissik, Land and Native Affairs, Harry Solomon held Public Works and Edward Rooth as whip', ' The Progressives in opposition would be led by George Farrar and Abe Bailey as the opposition whip', ' They all assembled for the first time in March 1907', ' After the 1907 election, the issue of Chinese mining labour was revisited with Het Volk believing there was enough labour in the form of black and white miners', ' Taking into account the economic interests of the Transvaal, Botha ensured a gradual policy of repatriation of Chinese labour', '  By 1908, the Boers had won in elections, control of Natal, Orange River and Transvaal colonies, but under British influence with the need now to unite the country under one government', '   Progression to Union  [[File:Spelterini Transvaal', 'jpg|thumb|200px|Aerial photography of gold mines, taken by Eduard Spelterini in July 1911]] In May 1908, Jan Smuts, Transvaal Colonial Secretary proposed a gathering of representatives from all four colonies and decide on a customs and railways agreement and included a proposal that the colonies appoint delegates to discuss a constitution for a united country in the form of a National Convention', ' The objective of the convention was to find a solution to the political, racial and economic problems encountered by these colonies and find common ground between Boer and the English', ' On 12 October 1908, the thirty white delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers', ' Twelve delegates came from the Cape Colony, eight from the Transvaal and five each from the Orange River and Natal Colonies representing a gathering of sixteen from an English background and the remaining fourteen were of Boer origin', '  The main issues discussed was whether the four colonies would become a country made up of a union or a federation', ' Who would be allowed to vote and the number of voters who would make-up a constituency in a rural and urban seat', ' All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and Jan Smuts', ' On the question of black enfranchisement, the British government was prepared to accept the final wishes of the National Convention', ' The colonies of the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races', ' A compromise was reached and all the colonies wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement was accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament', ' As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents', ' This system for the constituencies would ensure that the Afrikaner would dominate politics in years to come and would be one of the many reasons why Jan Smuts would lose the 1948 election, sweeping D', 'F', ' Malan to power and the beginning of Apartheid', ' The results of the negotiations at the Convention became the draft South Africa Act which was released for viewing on 9 February 1909', ' By 19 August 1909, the South Africa Act passed through the Houses of Commons and into law', '  As to the question of black enfranchisement, the views of British and Boers were similar with Alfred Milner stating in a speech in 1903, that he believed in white superiority and thought the black man was not ready to rule and had similarly persuaded the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain to allow a future united white government to decide the question of

The economic issues faced included the restoration of the mining industry to pre-war levels, then growing it further with the need for extra labour, the restoration of the Boers to their lands and increasing the agricultural output of those farms', ' The political issue faced depended on what side of politics one stood on', ' The existing British administrators under Alfred Milner wished to anglicise the population through two main means', ' One by increasing the English-speaking population of the Transvaal and the other by teaching the Boer children in English with very little Dutch

sanitary functions', ' Within fifteen months of the end of the war, the introduction of municipal government was introduced with preparations made for fair elections based on property valuation and the creation of voters rolls with registration process explained in English and Dutch', '  Economic issues The British administrators set out to place most Boer farmers back on their land by March 1903 with nineteen million pounds spent on war damages, grants and loans', ' The administrators reformed the state agricultural departments to modernise farming in the colony which resulted in a maize and beef surplus by 1908', ' They also attempted to solve the poor white problem by settling them as tenant farmers on state land but lack of capital and labour caused the scheme to fail', ' An

to restart the industry but labour was required', "" Just prior to the war, white miners wages were high and magnates weren't keen to increase the wages and since black miners wages had been reduced before the war and not increased, so black labour weren't interested in working the mines"", ' Unskilled white labour was ruled out as their wages would be too high for the work done, so the mining magnates and their Chamber of Mines in 1903, sought alternative labour in the form of cheap Chinese workers', ' The legislation to import Chinese labour was introduced to the Transvaal Legislative

1907, South African gold mines represented thirty-two percent of the worlds gold output', ' By 1910, Chinese labour ended on the Witwatersrand and the restrictive job reservation laws preventing Chinese miners doing certain jobs was replicated for Black miners', '  Political issues  From the end of the war in 1902, the political administration of the Transvaal colony was controlled by members of a legislative and executive council, all appointed by the British Administrators under Alfred Milner and the Colonial Secretary in London', ' In 1903, three seats in the Transvaal Legislative council were offered to Louis Botha, Jan Smuts and Koos de la Rey, but they turned the British down', ' Due to a lack of a hearing given to the opinions of the Boer generals by the English administrators concerning Chinese mine labour, due to a belief they did not represent the Boer population, and the want of self-rule, garnered Louis Botha and others to meet in 1904 at a Volkskongres', ' The result of this people congress was the unification of the Boer political movement in the Transvaal into a new party called Het Volk in January 1905 by Louis Botha and Jan Smuts', "" This new party's objective was to seek reconciliation with Britain, which would be favoured by the British opposition Liberal Party, and Boer self-rule for the Transvaal"", '  English political movements included the Transvaal Responsible Government Association, the Transvaal Progressive Association and labour groups under an Industrial Labour Party', ' The Transvaal Responsible Government Association was formed in late 1904 by E', 'P Solomon and made up of loose gathering of ex-colonial and ZAR officials and diamond mining magnates, labour and businessmen', ' They called for the allowance of the colony to create its own policy and strive for self-government and the party would eventually be renamed the Nationalists', ' The Transvaal Progressive Association, formed in November 1904 and active from February 1905, had a similar membership but was linked to the mining industry opposed self-rule and preferred a legislature nominated by the High Commissioner with strong links to Britain', ' They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick', '  The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later in February 1907 an election was held with Het Volk running on two issues; Chinese labour needing to be ended when new labour sources were found and reconciliation with Britain with which they hoped would attract the English labourer vote as well as selling themselves as an alternative to the mining capitalistic Progressive Party', '   1907 election   The election was held on 20 February 1907 and

Witwatersrand with three independents aligning themselves with the party', ' The Progressive Party stood 34 candidates and won 21 seats, twenty on the Witwatersrand and one in Pretoria with five Randlords winning seats', ' Other parties included the Nationalists (old Transvaal Responsible Government Association) that won 6 seats, four on the Witwatersrand and two in Pretoria but their leader Richard Solomon failed to win his seat', '  The Transvaal Independent Labour Party won three seats in the Witwatersrand after contesting 14, but their leader Frederic Creswell failed to gain a seat',

Mines, Henry Charles Hull, Treasurer, Johann Rissik, Land and Native Affairs, Harry Solomon held Public Works and Edward Rooth as whip', ' The Progressives in opposition would be led by George Farrar and Abe Bailey as the opposition whip', ' They all assembled for the first time in March 1907', ' After the 1907 election, the issue of Chinese mining labour was revisited with Het Volk believing there was enough labour in the form of black and white miners', ' Taking into account the economic interests of the Transvaal, Botha ensured a gradual policy of repatriation of Chinese labour', '  By 1908, the Boers had won in elections, control of Natal, Orange River and Transvaal colonies, but under British influence with the need now to unite the country under one government', '   Progression to Union  [[File:Spelterini Transvaal', 'jpg|thumb|200px|Aerial photography of gold mines, taken by Eduard Spelterini in July 1911]] In May 1908, Jan Smuts, Transvaal Colonial Secretary proposed a gathering of representatives from all four colonies and decide on a customs and railways agreement and included a proposal that the colonies appoint delegates to discuss a constitution for a united country in the form of a National Convention', ' The objective of the convention was to find a solution to the political, racial and economic problems encountered by these colonies and find common ground between Boer and the English', ' On 12 October 1908, the thirty white delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers', ' Twelve delegates came from the Cape Colony, eight from the Transvaal and five each from the Orange River and Natal Colonies representing a gathering of sixteen from an English background and the remaining fourteen were of Boer origin', '  The main issues discussed was whether the four colonies would become a country made up of a union or a federation', ' Who would be allowed to vote and the number of voters who would make-up a constituency in a rural and urban seat', ' All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and Jan Smuts', ' On the question of black enfranchisement, the British government was prepared to accept the final wishes of the National Convention', ' The colonies of the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races', ' A compromise was reached and all the colonies wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement was accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament', ' As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents', ' This system for the constituencies would ensure that the Afrikaner would dominate politics in years to come and would be one of the many reasons why Jan Smuts would lose the 1948 election, sweeping D', 'F', ' Malan to power and the beginning of Apartheid', ' The results of the negotiations at the Convention became the draft South Africa Act which was released for viewing on 9 February 1909', ' By 19 August 1909, the South Africa Act passed through the Houses of Commons and into law', '  As to the question of black enfranchisement, the views of British and Boers were similar with Alfred Milner stating in a speech in 1903, that he believed in white superiority and thought the black man was not ready to rule and had similarly persuaded the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain to allow a future united white government to decide the question of

natives not be discussed until after self-government', '  That no special tax be introduced to cover the costs of the war', '  That various commissions be established to process and pay valid claims for war expenses and to honor script issued by the countries of the ZAR and Orange Free State during the period of the war', ' The commission would also feed the homeless and assist with the reconstruction of homes affected by the war', ' To that end, the crown agrees to a free grant of £3,000,000 as well as loans at no interest for two years to be repaid at 3 percent interest over years thereafter', '  In 1902, with peace following the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging, the new Transvaal colony was faced with intertwined economic and political issues that need to be resolved', ' The economic issues faced included the restoration of the mining industry to pre-war levels, then growing it further with the need for extra labour, the restoration of the Boers to their lands and increasing the agricultural output of those farms', ' The political issue faced depended on what side of politics one stood on', ' The existing British administrators under Alfred Milner wished to anglicise the population through two main means', ' One by increasing the English-speaking population of the Transvaal and the other by teaching the Boer children in English with very little Dutch used, followed by self-rule', "" The Transvaal Boers' political objectives were the restoration of self-rule in the colony and the political environment to be dominated by the Boers"", '   Repatriation and reconstruction  As the war ended the British were faced with a large proportion of Boer men as prisoners of war and their families in concentration camps', ' As the British followed a scorched earth policy in the Transvaal, Boer lands, stock and farms had been destroyed', '  At the conclusion of the war, it was necessary to reconstruct a ""government"" for the new colony and this was begun with the appointment of a Resident Magistrate in every district of the colony and became District Commissioners while an Assistant Magistrate carried out the legal and magisterial duties of the area', ' Roman-Dutch law was translated into English so the law courts could continue, with some old acts repealed and a considerable amount of new law promulgated by the authorities in Johannesburg', '  The Resident Magistrate then submitted the names of three members of the district to the Governor for district commission under the magistrate', ' They would consist of one British subject, and two Boers, one from those who had surrendered early on in the war and one who had fought until the end', ' The commission would have two functions, one to provide assistance and issuing of rations, equipment, transport and plough animals to those affected by the war, secondly to investigate claims for compensation for actual damages sustained during the war', '  Repatriation depots were established in the districts and they were stocked with food, seed, agricultural equipment, transport, plough animals and stone and building material', ' The rail transport network struggled to compete with the transport of army requirement to maintain a garrison and civilian requirements to repair the colony', ' All feed for transport animals had to be brought to the depots as the process started in the winter of 1902', ' Refugees from the concentration camps and prisoners of war were returned to their districts in a system of drafts', ' At the depots, they would receive farm equipment, tents and rations to start again and transport to their destinations', ' Food rations were provided for almost a year', ' Families would receive a token grant irrespective of their ability to pay it back and additional material and equipment required were obtained via interest-free loans with small cash loans also attracting no interest, with larger loans attracting four percent interest by a mortgage', ' The loan scheme was never going to compensate a person for the actual loss experienced by the war', ' Damage and the reconstruction required varied from district to district,  In the larger towns, municipal or health boards were ""appointed"" to manage them under the resident Magistrate', ' They had limited functions and the only rates they levied were for sanitary functions', ' Within fifteen months of the end of the war, the introduction of municipal government was introduced with preparations made for fair elections based on property valuation and the creation of voters rolls with registration process explained in English and Dutch', '  Economic issues The British administrators set out to place most Boer farmers back on their land by March 1903 with nineteen million pounds spent on war damages, grants and loans', ' The administrators reformed the state agricultural departments to modernise farming in the colony which resulted in a maize and beef surplus by 1908', ' They also attempted to solve the poor white problem by settling them as tenant farmers on state land but lack of capital and labour caused the scheme to fail', ' An attempt was made to place English settlers on farmland so as to anglicise the Transvaal and increase the English-speaking population but this failed too as the policy attracted too few settlers', '  By the end of 1901, gold mining finally resumed on the Rand around Johannesburg, having virtually stopped since 1899', ' Backed by the mining magnates and the British administrators, there was a need to restart the industry but labour was required', "" Just prior to the war, white miners wages were high and magnates weren't keen to increase the wages and since black miners wages had been reduced before the war and not increased, so black labour weren't interested in working the mines"", ' Unskilled white labour was ruled out as their wages would be too high for the work done, so the mining magnates and their Chamber of Mines in 1903, sought alternative labour in the form of cheap Chinese workers', ' The legislation to import Chinese labour was introduced to the Transvaal Legislative Council on 28 December 1903 by George Farrar and was debated for 30 hours and successfully voted on after its three readings on 30 December 1903, coming into law in February 1904', ' Having been rubber-stamped by the British and mining appointed Transvaal Legislative Council it outlined extremely restrictive employment contracts for the Chinese workers and the idea had been sold via a fear campaign aimed at white miners about the need for this labour or face the possibility of loss of mining and their jobs', ' By 1906, the gold mines of the Witwatersrand were in full production and by 1907, South African gold mines represented thirty-two percent of the worlds gold output', ' By 1910, Chinese labour ended on the Witwatersrand and the restrictive job reservation laws preventing Chinese miners doing certain jobs was replicated for Black miners', '  Political issues  From the end of the war in 1902, the political administration of the Transvaal colony was controlled by members of a legislative and executive council, all appointed by the British Administrators under Alfred Milner and the Colonial Secretary in London', ' In 1903, three seats in the Transvaal Legislative council were offered to Louis Botha, Jan Smuts and Koos de la Rey, but they turned the British down', ' Due to a lack of a hearing given to the opinions of the Boer generals by the English administrators concerning Chinese mine labour, due to a belief they did not represent the Boer population, and the want of self-rule, garnered Louis Botha and others to meet in 1904 at a Volkskongres', ' The result of this people congress was the unification of the Boer political movement in the Transvaal into a new party called Het Volk in January 1905 by Louis Botha and Jan Smuts', "" This new party's objective was to seek reconciliation with Britain, which would be favoured by the British opposition Liberal Party, and Boer self-rule for the Transvaal"", '  English political movements included the Transvaal Responsible Government Association, the Transvaal Progressive Association and labour groups under an Industrial Labour Party', ' The Transvaal Responsible Government Association was formed in late 1904 by E', 'P Solomon and made up of loose gathering of ex-colonial and ZAR officials and diamond mining magnates, labour and businessmen', ' They called for the allowance of the colony to create its own policy and strive for self-government and the party would eventually be renamed the Nationalists', ' The Transvaal Progressive Association, formed in November 1904 and active from February 1905, had a similar membership but was linked to the mining industry opposed self-rule and preferred a legislature nominated by the High Commissioner with strong links to Britain', ' They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick', '  The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later in February 1907 an election was held with Het Volk running on two issues; Chinese labour needing to be ended when new labour sources were found and reconciliation with Britain with which they hoped would attract the English labourer vote as well as selling themselves as an alternative to the mining capitalistic Progressive Party', '   1907 election   The election was held on 20 February 1907 and Het Volk won the election gathering 37 of 69 seats', ' It stood 43 candidates and won 34 seats outright, all the country seats were gained bar Barberton, three seats in Pretoria and four on the Witwatersrand with three independents aligning themselves with the party', ' The Progressive Party stood 34 candidates and won 21 seats, twenty on the Witwatersrand and one in Pretoria with five Randlords winning seats', ' Other parties included the Nationalists (old Transvaal Responsible Government Association) that won 6 seats, four on the Witwatersrand and two in Pretoria but their leader Richard Solomon failed to win his seat', '  The Transvaal Independent Labour Party won three seats in the Witwatersrand after contesting 14, but their leader Frederic Creswell failed to gain a seat', '  Louis Botha became Prime Minister of the Transvaal and Agriculture minister with Jan Smuts as its colonial secretary', ' Other new cabinet ministers included J de Villiers, Attorney-General and Mines, Henry Charles Hull, Treasurer, Johann Rissik, Land and Native Affairs, Harry Solomon held Public Works and Edward Rooth as whip', ' The Progressives in opposition would be led by George Farrar and Abe Bailey as the opposition whip', ' They all assembled for the first time in March 1907', ' After the 1907 election, the issue of Chinese mining labour was revisited with Het Volk believing there was enough labour in the form of black and white miners', ' Taking into account the economic interests of the Transvaal, Botha ensured a gradual policy of repatriation of Chinese labour', '  By 1908, the Boers had won in elections, control of Natal, Orange River and Transvaal colonies, but under British influence with the need now to unite the country under one government', '   Progression to Union  [[File:Spelterini Transvaal', 'jpg|thumb|200px|Aerial photography of gold mines, taken by Eduard Spelterini in July 1911]] In May 1908, Jan Smuts, Transvaal Colonial Secretary proposed a gathering of representatives from all four colonies and decide on a customs and railways agreement and included a proposal that the colonies appoint delegates to discuss a constitution for a united country in the form of a National Convention', ' The objective of the convention was to find a solution to the political, racial and economic problems encountered by these colonies and find common ground between Boer and the English', ' On 12 October 1908, the thirty white delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers', ' Twelve delegates came from the Cape Colony, eight from the Transvaal and five each from the Orange River and Natal Colonies representing a gathering of sixteen from an English background and the remaining fourteen were of Boer origin', '  The main issues discussed was whether the four colonies would become a country made up of a union or a federation', ' Who would be allowed to vote and the number of voters who would make-up a constituency in a rural and urban seat', ' All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and Jan Smuts', ' On the question of black enfranchisement, the British government was prepared to accept the final wishes of the National Convention', ' The colonies of the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races', ' A compromise was reached and all the colonies wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement was accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament', ' As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents', ' This system for the constituencies would ensure that the Afrikaner would dominate politics in years to come and would be one of the many reasons why Jan Smuts would lose the 1948 election, sweeping D', 'F', ' Malan to power and the beginning of Apartheid', ' The results of the negotiations at the Convention became the draft South Africa Act which was released for viewing on 9 February 1909', ' By 19 August 1909, the South Africa Act passed through the Houses of Commons and into law', '  As to the question of black enfranchisement, the views of British and Boers were similar with Alfred Milner stating in a speech in 1903, that he believed in white superiority and thought the black man was not ready to rule and had similarly persuaded the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain to allow a future united white government to decide the question of the black franchise', '  Colonial Administration  Prior to the grant of responsible self-government on 6 December 1906, the Colony was administered by an Executive Council appointed by the Governor',

hearings at the Supreme Court in Johannesburg from 20 January until 26 January 1987', ' The board then adjourned to analyze the evidence and reach conclusions as to cause', ""  Analysis The board concluded that the 37° turn was executed by the navigator using the autopilot's Doppler navigation mode, which when set maintained the desired heading while making corrections for wind drift"", ' The navigator performed this turn after he saw the VOR signal indicating that the aircraft had intercepted the Maputo VOR 45° radial, the compass direction from Maputo on which the crew intended to turn and approach for a landing on runway 23', ' However the turn actually put the aircraft on a path following a 45° radial from the VOR beacon at Matsapa Airport, Swaziland', '  Discounting the possibility of a false VOR beacon, an analysis of which was included in an appendix, the board considered it probable that the flight crew had inadvertently set the first of two VOR receivers on board to the Matsapa VOR frequency', ' This error was made more likely by the poor design of the instruments, the absence of back lighting of the selected frequencies, the fact the two frequencies were unusually close, 112', '7 MHz for Maputo and 112', ""3\xa0MHz for Matsapa, and the similarity between the figures '7' and '3' on the Soviet instrumentation"", '  The board considered it ""quite likely"" that after the turn the captain re-tuned first VOR receiver to the ILS frequency, as the instrument was found in this state after the crash', ' For the final stages of flight, the aircraft was not following any VOR signal; instead the autopilot was tracking the 221° heading the navigator had set earlier during the turn', "" The post-accident settings of the second VOR receiver showed that it was displaying the aeroplane's position relative to Maputo and was correctly set to the Maputo VOR frequency, but was apparently not being used to guide the autopilot nor was it being monitored by the crew"", ""  The captain's initial erroneous assumption that Maputo had suffered an electrical blackout was never reconsidered by the crew, despite evidence to the contrary"", ' Throughout the descent the crew were in radio contact with the Maputo controller, who therefore had electrical power, and backup power generators were standard equipment for airport navigational aids', ' All the navigation aids at Maputo were determined by the board to be working at the time of the accident, although the aircraft was flying too far away and too low to receive the ILS and NDB signals', ' When announcing the distance remaining to Maputo the navigator was apparently referring to the Doppler navigation system, which was not accurate, rather than the DME equipment available on board which correctly displayed the distance to the Maputo DME beacon', '  The crew were criticized for failing to perform any checklist items or navigational aid identification, as well as for the distractions and non-essential conversations in the cockpit during the descent into Maputo', ' As a consequence of not announcing to the other crew members which navigational aids were being used, or the frequencies being set, mistakes could not be corrected by others through ""cross-checking""', ' Regarding it essential that the relatively large crew in the cockpit work as a well-integrated team, the board concluded that ""demonstrably they had not""', '  The board found that use of non-standard phraseology between the Maputo controller and the crew led to confusion about the status of the ILS signal and whether the runway lights were on', ' The flight crew\'s repeated requests to ""check runway lights"" were interpreted by the controller, based on the use of the word \'check\' in civil aviation, as confirmation by the crew that they had the runway lights in sight', ' The aircraft had not refueled at Mbala before departing and did not have enough fuel remaining to reach the intended alternative airport in Beira, Mozambique by the time it reached Maputo', ' This may have greatly increased the pressure on the crew to continue with the landing approach to Maputo despite the difficulties encountered', '  Although the Maputo controller had specifically cleared the aircraft only to  and no lower until the runway lights were in sight, the descent continued below that height at a rate of , without the runway lights visible, in darkness and partially cloudy conditions', ' The only reaction to the warning by the GPWS, which sounded for 32 seconds, was the captain exclaiming ""Damn it!"" and a very slight nose-up pitch of the aircraft', ' The board concluded that even just seconds before the impact had the crew performed the required procedures for a GPWS alert when flying over hilly or unknown terrain, quickly raising the nose and increasing power, this would have prevented the crash', ' The captain was singled out for criticism by the board for the decision to continue the descent without any ground references and with the belief that all navigation aids at Maputo were not working, instead of climbing to the published minimum safe altitude for the Maputo area of  and verifying his position through other aids available, including his radar', '  Findings The board of inquiry determined that:  In addition the board issued five safety recommendations which covered the use of and recurrent training in approved terminology in ATC communications for both ground and flight crews, monitoring of crew compliance with established procedures, a proposal that CVRs retain a record of the last hour of flight, rather than the standard of 30 minutes, and the importance of maintaining navigational aids to international standards', '  The report was

hearings at the Supreme Court in Johannesburg from 20 January until 26 January 1987', ' The board then adjourned to analyze the evidence and reach conclusions as to cause', ""  Analysis The board concluded that the 37° turn was executed by the navigator using the autopilot's Doppler navigation mode, which when set maintained the desired heading while making corrections for wind drift"", ' The navigator performed this turn after he saw the VOR signal indicating that the aircraft had intercepted the Maputo VOR 45° radial, the compass direction from Maputo on which the crew intended to turn and approach for a landing on runway 23', ' However the turn actually put the aircraft on a path following a 45° radial from the VOR beacon at Matsapa Airport, Swaziland', '  Discounting the possibility of a false VOR beacon, an analysis of which was included in an appendix, the board considered it probable that the flight crew had inadvertently set the first of two VOR receivers on board to the Matsapa VOR frequency', ' This error was made more likely by the poor design of the instruments, the absence of back lighting of the selected frequencies, the fact the two frequencies were unusually close, 112', '7 MHz for Maputo and 112', ""3\xa0MHz for Matsapa, and the similarity between the figures '7' and '3' on the Soviet instrumentation"", '  The board considered it ""quite likely"" that after the turn the captain re-tuned first VOR receiver to the ILS frequency, as the instrument was found in this state after the crash', ' For the final stages of flight, the aircraft was not following any VOR signal; instead the autopilot was tracking the 221° heading the navigator had set earlier during the turn', "" The post-accident settings of the second VOR receiver showed that it was displaying the aeroplane's position relative to Maputo and was correctly set to the Maputo VOR frequency, but was apparently not being used to guide the autopilot nor was it being monitored by the crew"", ""  The captain's initial erroneous assumption that Maputo had suffered an electrical blackout was never reconsidered by the crew, despite evidence to the contrary"", ' Throughout the descent the crew were in radio contact with the Maputo controller, who therefore had electrical power, and backup power generators were standard equipment for airport navigational aids', ' All the navigation aids at Maputo were determined by the board to be working at the time of the accident, although the aircraft was flying too far away and too low to receive the ILS and NDB signals', ' When announcing the distance remaining to Maputo the navigator was apparently referring to the Doppler navigation system, which was not accurate, rather than the DME equipment available on board which correctly displayed the distance to the Maputo DME beacon', '  The crew were criticized for failing to perform any checklist items or navigational aid identification, as well as for the distractions and non-essential conversations in the cockpit during the descent into Maputo', ' As a consequence of not announcing to the other crew members which navigational aids were being used, or

thereafter', '  In 1902, with peace following the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging, the new Transvaal colony was faced with intertwined economic and political issues that need to be resolved', ' The economic issues faced included the restoration of the mining industry to pre-war levels, then growing it further with the need for extra labour, the restoration of the Boers to their lands and increasing the agricultural output of those farms', ' The political issue faced depended on what side of politics one stood on', ' The existing British administrators under Alfred Milner wished to anglicise the population through two main means', ' One by increasing the English-speaking population of the Transvaal and the other by teaching the Boer children in English with very little Dutch used, followed by self-rule', "" The Transvaal Boers' political objectives were the restoration of self-rule in the colony and the political environment to be dominated by the Boers"", '   Repatriation and reconstruction  As the war ended the British were faced with a large proportion of Boer men as prisoners of war and their families in concentration camps', ' As the British followed a scorched earth policy in the Transvaal, Boer lands, stock and farms had been destroyed', '  At the conclusion of the war, it was necessary to reconstruct a ""government"" for the new colony and this was begun with the appointment of a Resident Magistrate in every district of the colony and became District Commissioners while an Assistant Magistrate carried out the legal and magisterial duties of the area', ' Roman-Dutch law was translated into English so the law courts could continue, with some old acts repealed and a considerable amount of new law promulgated by the authorities in Johannesburg', '  The Resident Magistrate then submitted the names of three members of the district to the Governor for district commission under the magistrate', ' They would consist of one British subject, and two Boers, one from those who had surrendered early on in the war and one who had fought until the end', ' The commission would have two functions, one to provide assistance and issuing of rations, equipment, transport and plough animals to those affected by the war, secondly to investigate claims for compensation for actual damages sustained during the war', '  Repatriation depots were established in the districts and they were stocked with food, seed, agricultural equipment, transport, plough animals and stone and building material', ' The rail transport network struggled to compete with the transport of army requirement to maintain a garrison and civilian requirements to repair the colony', ' All feed for transport animals had to be brought to the depots as the process started in the winter of 1902', ' Refugees from the concentration camps and prisoners of war were returned to their districts in a system of drafts', ' At the depots, they would receive farm equipment, tents and rations to start again and transport to their destinations', ' Food rations were provided for almost a year', ' Families would receive a token grant irrespective of their ability to pay it back and additional material and equipment required were obtained via interest-free loans with small cash loans also attracting no interest, with larger loans attracting four percent interest by a mortgage', ' The loan scheme was never going to compensate a person for the actual loss experienced by the war', ' Damage and the reconstruction required varied from district to district,  In the larger towns, municipal or health boards were ""appointed"" to manage them under the resident Magistrate', ' They had limited functions and the only rates they levied were for sanitary functions', ' Within fifteen months of the end of the war, the introduction of municipal government was introduced with preparations made for fair elections based on property valuation and the creation of voters rolls with registration process explained in English and Dutch', '  Economic issues The British administrators set out to place most Boer farmers back on their land by March 1903 with nineteen million pounds spent on war damages, grants and loans', ' The administrators reformed the state agricultural departments to modernise farming in the colony which resulted in a maize and beef surplus by 1908', ' They also attempted to solve the poor white problem by settling them as tenant farmers on state land but lack of capital and labour caused the scheme to fail', ' An attempt was made to place English settlers on farmland so as to anglicise the Transvaal and increase the English-speaking population but this failed too as the policy attracted too few settlers', '  By the end of 1901, gold mining finally resumed on the Rand around Johannesburg, having virtually stopped since 1899', ' Backed by the mining magnates and the British administrators, there was a need to restart the industry but labour was required', "" Just prior to the war, white miners wages were high and magnates weren't keen to increase the wages and since black miners wages had been reduced before the war and not increased, so black labour weren't interested in working the mines"", ' Unskilled white labour was ruled out as their wages would be too high for the work done, so the mining magnates and their Chamber of Mines in 1903, sought alternative labour in the form of cheap Chinese workers', ' The legislation to import Chinese labour was introduced to the Transvaal Legislative Council on 28 December 1903 by George Farrar and was debated for 30 hours and successfully voted on after its three readings on 30 December 1903, coming into law in February 1904', ' Having been rubber-stamped by the British and mining appointed Transvaal Legislative Council it outlined extremely restrictive employment contracts for the Chinese workers and the idea had been sold via a fear campaign aimed at white miners about the need for this labour or face the possibility of loss of mining and their jobs', ' By 1906, the gold mines of the Witwatersrand were in full production and by 1907, South African gold mines represented thirty-two percent of the worlds gold output', ' By 1910, Chinese labour ended on the Witwatersrand and the restrictive job reservation laws preventing Chinese miners doing certain jobs was replicated for Black miners', '  Political issues  From the end of the war in 1902, the political administration of the Transvaal colony was controlled by members of a legislative and executive council, all appointed by the British Administrators under Alfred Milner and the Colonial Secretary in London', ' In 1903, three seats in the Transvaal Legislative council were offered to Louis Botha, Jan Smuts and Koos de la Rey, but they turned the British down', ' Due to a lack of a hearing given to the opinions of the Boer generals by the English administrators concerning Chinese mine labour, due to a belief they did not represent the Boer population, and the want of self-rule, garnered Louis Botha and others to meet in 1904 at a Volkskongres', ' The result of this people congress was the unification of the Boer political movement in the Transvaal into a new party called Het Volk in January 1905 by Louis Botha and Jan Smuts', "" This new party's objective was to seek reconciliation with Britain, which would be favoured by the British opposition Liberal Party, and Boer self-rule for the Transvaal"", '  English political movements included the Transvaal Responsible Government Association, the Transvaal Progressive Association and labour groups under an Industrial Labour Party', ' The Transvaal Responsible Government Association was formed in late 1904 by E', 'P Solomon and made up of loose gathering of ex-colonial and ZAR officials and diamond mining magnates, labour and businessmen', ' They called for the allowance of the colony to create its own policy and strive for self-government and the party would eventually be renamed the Nationalists', ' The Transvaal Progressive Association, formed in November 1904 and active from February 1905, had a similar membership but was linked to the mining industry opposed self-rule and preferred a legislature nominated by the High Commissioner with strong links to Britain', ' They were led by George Farrar and Percy Fitzpatrick', '  The pro-Boer Liberal Party in Britain came to power in January 1906 with a new policy for the two former Boer colonies, one of self-rule', ' Jan Smuts visited London and managed to persuade the new government to formulate a system that would favour the Boers and Het Volk in a new political assembly', ' More than a year later in February 1907 an election was held with Het Volk running on two issues; Chinese labour needing to be ended when new labour sources were found and reconciliation with Britain with which they hoped would attract the English labourer vote as well as selling themselves as an alternative to the mining capitalistic Progressive Party', '   1907 election   The election was held on 20 February 1907 and Het Volk won the election gathering 37 of 69 seats', ' It stood 43 candidates and won 34 seats outright, all the country seats were gained bar Barberton, three seats in Pretoria and four on the Witwatersrand with three independents aligning themselves with the party', ' The Progressive Party stood 34 candidates and won 21 seats, twenty on the Witwatersrand and one in Pretoria with five Randlords winning seats', ' Other parties included the Nationalists (old Transvaal Responsible Government Association) that won 6 seats, four on the Witwatersrand and two in Pretoria but their leader Richard Solomon failed to win his seat', '  The Transvaal Independent Labour Party won three seats in the Witwatersrand after contesting 14, but their leader Frederic Creswell failed to gain a seat', '  Louis Botha became Prime Minister of the Transvaal and Agriculture minister with Jan Smuts as its colonial secretary', ' Other new cabinet ministers included J de Villiers, Attorney-General and Mines, Henry Charles Hull, Treasurer, Johann Rissik, Land and Native Affairs, Harry Solomon held Public Works and Edward Rooth as whip', ' The Progressives in opposition would be led by George Farrar and Abe Bailey as the opposition whip', ' They all assembled for the first time in March 1907', ' After the 1907 election, the issue of Chinese mining labour was revisited with Het Volk believing there was enough labour in the form of black and white miners', ' Taking into account the economic interests of the Transvaal, Botha ensured a gradual policy of repatriation of Chinese labour', '  By 1908, the Boers had won in elections, control of Natal, Orange River and Transvaal colonies, but under British influence with the need now to unite the country under one government', '   Progression to Union  [[File:Spelterini Transvaal', 'jpg|thumb|200px|Aerial photography of gold mines, taken by Eduard Spelterini in July 1911]] In May 1908, Jan Smuts, Transvaal Colonial Secretary proposed a gathering of representatives from all four colonies and decide on a customs and railways agreement and included a proposal that the colonies appoint delegates to discuss a constitution for a united country in the form of a National Convention', ' The objective of the convention was to find a solution to the political, racial and economic problems encountered by these colonies and find common ground between Boer and the English', ' On 12 October 1908, the thirty white delegates of the four colonies met in Durban under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry de Villiers', ' Twelve delegates came from the Cape Colony, eight from the Transvaal and five each from the Orange River and Natal Colonies representing a gathering of sixteen from an English background and the remaining fourteen were of Boer origin', '  The main issues discussed was whether the four colonies would become a country made up of a union or a federation', ' Who would be allowed to vote and the number of voters who would make-up a constituency in a rural and urban seat', ' All three objectives were eventually finalised with South Africa to become a union which was the wish of both the Liberal British government and Jan Smuts', ' On the question of black enfranchisement, the British government was prepared to accept the final wishes of the National Convention', ' The colonies of the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal wanted no black enfranchisement while the Cape Colony wished to keep what limited enfranchisement it had for all other races', ' A compromise was reached and all the colonies wishes concerning their racial make-up for enfranchisement was accepted, though subject to a repeal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament', ' As to the objective of rural and urban constituencies, it was decided to allow fifteen percent fewer constituents for a rural seat while an urban seat would have fifteen percent more constituents', ' This system for the constituencies would ensure that the Afrikaner would dominate politics in years to come and would be one of the many reasons why Jan Smuts would lose the 1948 election, sweeping D', 'F', ' Malan to power and the beginning of Apartheid', ' The results of the negotiations at the Convention became the draft South Africa Act which was released for viewing on 9 February 1909', ' By 19 August 1909, the South Africa Act passed through the Houses of Commons and into law', '  As to the question of black enfranchisement, the views of British and Boers were similar with Alfred Milner stating in a speech in 1903, that he believed in white
