"" In support of Prince Mpande as Dingane's replacement, Pretorius' strategy was to target Dingane only"", "" To allow Prince Mpande to oust King Dingane through military might, Pretorius had first to weaken Dingane's personal military power base in UmGungundlovu"", "" Dingane's royal residence at UmGungundlovu was naturally protected against attack by hilly and rocky terrain all around, as well as an access route via Italeni passing through a narrow gorge called a defile"", '  Earlier on 9 April 1838, a Trekker horse commando without ox wagons, thereafter called the ""Flight Commando"", had

engaging Dingane in UmGungundlovu after losing the battle of Italeni, and subsequently had migrated with his group out of Natal', ' To approach UmGungundlovu via the Italeni defile with ox wagons

limited"", ' Proven UmGungundlovu defense tactics were to attack Trekker commandos in the rocky and hilly terrain on the narrowing access route at Italeni, thereby neutralising the advantages mounted riflemen had over spear-carrying foot soldiers', ' Ndlela had to let Pretorius come close to UmGungundlovu at Italeni and lure the Trekkers into attack', ' Ndlela was not to attack the Trekkers when they were in a defensive wagon laager position, especially not during the day', "" The problem for Pretorius was that he had somehow to find a way to make Dingane's soldiers attack him in a defensive laager position at a place of his choice, far away from UmGungundlovu and Italeni"", '  On 6 December 1838, 10 days before the Battle of Blood River, Pretorius and his commando including Alexander Biggar as translator had a meeting with friendly Zulu chiefs at Danskraal, so named for the Zulu dancing that took place in the Zulu kraal that the Trekker commando visited', ' With the intelligence received at Danskraal, Pretorius became confident enough to propose a vow to God, which demanded the celebration, by the commando and their posterity, of the coming victory over Dingane', ' The covenant included that a church would be built in honour of God, should the commando be successful and reach UmGungundlovu alive in order to diminish the power of Dingane', ' Building a church in

Saturday, 15 December 1838, after the Trekker wagons crossed the Buffalo River 10\xa0km SW of the actual battle site and still  from their target UmGungundlovu, an advance scouting party including Pretorius got news of a large Zulu force in rugged terrain to the east trying to lure the Boers into a trap as had been the case in April the same year with fatal consequences', "" While Cilliers wanted to ride out and attack, Pretorius declined the opportunity to engage Dingane's soldiers away from their base as had been the trap at Italeni valley"", ' Instead, Pretorius decided on a fortified laager on the terrain of his own choosing in the hope that general Ndlela would attack Pretorius on his terms rather than the other way around', '  As the site for the defensive wagon laager, Pretorius chose a defensible position close to a vertical 8m descent into a deep hippo pool in the Ncombe River providing excellent protection on two sides', ' The wide-open area to the front of the laager provided absolutely no cover for an attacking force', ' The battle was set with the laager protected on two flanks', ' As usual, the ox-wagons were drawn into the typical protective enclosure or laager', ' Movable wooden barriers and ladders which could be quickly opened for cavalry were fastened between the wagon wheels to prevent intruders, with two smoothbore, short barrel artillery pieces positioned at the corners', ' Andries Pretorius had brought a 6-pound naval carronade with him from the Cape, mounted on a gun carriage improvised from a wagon axle, and named Grietjie', ' The other ordnance piece is unknown in the original, but the reproduction depicts a 4-pound smoothbore cannon by then obsolete in most European armies', ' Both were used to fire devastating grapeshot', '  As evening approached, a thick mist settled over the wagon site above which the sky was clear', ' According to Afrikaner traditions, the Zulu were afraid to attack at the night due to superstitions and the eerie glow of lamps which the Boers hung on sjamboks [whip-stocks] around the laager', ' Whether or not there is any truth in this, historian S', 'P', ' Mackenzie has speculated that the Zulu held back until what they perceived as the necessary numbers had arrived', ' Some of the Zulus only arrived near sunrise by following the tracks of the wagons', ' Due to some recent heavy rains the Ncombe River was swollen making crossing the river difficult', '  During the night of 15 December, six Zulu regiments, an estimated 20,000 (or more) Zulu soldiers led by Dambuza (Nzobo), crossed the Ncome River and started massing around the encampment, while the elite forces of senior general Ndlela did not cross the river, thereby splitting the army in two', '  Battle On 16 December, dawn broke on a clear day, revealing that ""all of Zululand sat there"", according to one Trekker eyewitness', "" General Ndlela and his crack troops, the Black and White Shields, remained on the other side of the river, observing Dambuza's men at the laager from a safe position across the hippo pool"", ' According to the South African Department of Art and Culture: In ceremonies that lasted about three days, izinyanga zempi, specialist war doctors, prepared izinteleze medicines which made warriors invincible in the face of their opponents', ""  This could partly help explain why Dambuza's forces were sitting on the ground close to the wagon laager when the Trekkers first saw them"", "" thumb|An artist's impression of the Battle of Blood River"", "" Dambuza's regiments repeatedly stormed the laager but could not break through"", "" The attackers were hindered by a change introduced during Shaka's rule that replaced most of the longer throwing spears with short stabbing spears"", ' In close combat the stabbing spear provided obvious advantages over its longer cousin', ' A Zulu eyewitness said that their first charge was mown down like grass by the Boer muskets', '  As Bantjes wrote in his journal:  With the power of their firearms and with their ox wagons in a laager formation and some effective tactics, the Boers fought off the Zulu', ' Buckshot was used to maximise casualties', ' Mackenzie claims that 200 indigenous servants looked after the horses and cattle and helped load muskets, but no definite proof or witness of servants helping to reload is available', ' Writing in the popular Afrikaans magazine Die Huisgenoot, a Dr', ' D', 'J', ' Kotze said that this group consisted of fifty-nine ""non-white helpers and followers"" instead of the commonly stated two hundred', '  After two hours and four waves of attack, with the intermittent lulls providing crucial reloading and resting opportunities for the Trekkers, Pretorius ordered a group of horsemen to leave the encampment and engage the Zulu in order to induce the disintegration of their formations', ' The Zulu withstood the charge for some time, but rapid losses led them to scatter', ' The Trekkers pursued their fleeing enemies and hunted them down for three hours', ' Cilliers noted later that ""we left the Kafirs lying on the ground as thick almost as pumpkins upon the field that has borne a plentiful crop', '"" Bantjes recorded that about 3,000 dead Zulu had been counted, and three Trekkers were wounded', ' During the chase, Pretorius was wounded in his left hand by an assegaai (Zulu spear)', "" Of the 3,000 dead Zulu soldiers, two were princes, leaving Ndlela's favourite Prince Mpande as frontrunner in the subsequent battle for the Zulu crown"", ""  Four days after the Battle of Blood River, the Trekker commando arrived at King Dingane's great kraal UmGungundlovu (near present-day Eshowe), only to find it deserted and in ashes"", ' The bones of Retief and

Covenant"" and ""Dingaan\'s Day""; but today it is ""the Day of Reconciliation""', '  Aftermath The conflict between Dingane and the Trekkers continued for one more year after the Battle of Blood River', "" The idea of a decisive victory may have been planted in Pretorius' mind by a Zulu prisoner, who said that most of Dingane's warriors had either been killed or fled"", ' The same prisoner led some of the Trekker party into a trap at the White Umfolozi River, eleven days after the battle at Ncome River', ' This time the Zulu were victorious', "" Only when Dingane's brother, Mpande, openly joined the Trekker side with his sizeable army, was Dingane finally defeated in January 1840"", ""  Following the Battle of Maqongqe in January 1840, the forces of Mpande did not wait for Pretorius' cavalry to arrive, and they attacked the remaining regiments of Dingane, who were again under the command of General Ndlela"", ' Ndlela strayed from normal fighting tactics against Mpande, sending in his regiments to fight one at a time, instead of together in ox horn formation', ' Maquongqe Dingane had to flee Natal completely, but before he did so, he had Ndlela slowly strangled by cow hide for high treason, on the grounds that he had fought for Mpande, with the same disastrous result for Dingane as at Ncome-Blood River', "" Dambusa, Dingane's other general, had already been executed by Mpande and Pretorius when he fell into their hands before the battle"", '  Pretorius approved and attended the crowning of Zulu King Mpande in Pietermaritzburg', ' They agreed on the Tugela River as the border between Zululand and the Republic of Natalia', '  Legacy Popular Afrikaner interpretations of the Battle of Blood River (bolstered by sympathetic historians such as George Theal) played a central role in fostering Afrikaner nationalism ', "" They believe that the battle demonstrated God's intervention and hence their divine right to exist as an independent people"", '

limited"", ' Proven UmGungundlovu defense tactics were to attack Trekker commandos in the rocky and hilly terrain on the narrowing access route at Italeni, thereby neutralising the advantages mounted riflemen had over spear-carrying foot soldiers', ' Ndlela had to let Pretorius come close to UmGungundlovu at Italeni and lure the Trekkers into attack', ' Ndlela was not to attack the Trekkers when they were in a defensive wagon laager position, especially not during the day', "" The problem for Pretorius was that he had somehow to find a way to make Dingane's soldiers attack him in a defensive laager position at a place of his choice, far away from UmGungundlovu and Italeni"", '  On 6 December 1838, 10 days before the Battle of Blood River, Pretorius and his commando including Alexander Biggar as translator had a meeting with friendly Zulu chiefs at Danskraal, so named for the Zulu dancing that took place in the Zulu kraal that the Trekker commando visited', ' With the intelligence received at Danskraal, Pretorius became confident enough to propose a vow to God, which demanded the celebration, by the commando and their posterity, of the coming victory over Dingane', ' The covenant included that a church would be built in honour of God, should the commando be successful and reach UmGungundlovu alive in order to diminish the power of Dingane', ' Building a church in Trekker emigrant context was symbol for establishing a settled state', '  After the meeting with friendly Zulu chiefs at Danskraal, Pretorius let the commando relax and do their washing for a few days at Wasbank till 9 December 1838', ' From Wasbank they slowly and daily moved closer to the site of the Battle of Blood River, practising laager defence tactics every evening for a week long', ' Then, by halting his advance towards UmGungundlovu on 15 December 1838, 40\xa0km before reaching the defile at Italeni, Pretorius had eliminated the Italeni terrain trap', '  Location and preparation On Saturday, 15 December 1838, after the Trekker wagons crossed the Buffalo River 10\xa0km SW of the actual battle site and still  from their target UmGungundlovu, an advance scouting party including Pretorius got news of a large Zulu force in rugged terrain to the east trying to lure the Boers into a trap as had been the case in April the same year with fatal consequences', "" While Cilliers wanted to ride out and attack, Pretorius declined the opportunity to engage Dingane's soldiers away from their base as had been the trap at Italeni valley"", ' Instead, Pretorius decided on a fortified laager on the terrain of his own choosing in the hope that general Ndlela would attack Pretorius on his terms rather than the other way around', '  As the site for the defensive wagon laager, Pretorius chose a defensible position close to a vertical 8m descent into a deep hippo pool in the Ncombe River providing excellent protection on two sides', ' The wide-open area to the front of the laager provided absolutely no cover for an attacking force', ' The battle was set with the laager protected on two flanks', ' As usual, the ox-wagons were drawn into the typical protective enclosure or laager', ' Movable wooden barriers and ladders which could be quickly opened for cavalry were fastened between the wagon wheels to prevent intruders, with two smoothbore, short barrel artillery pieces positioned at the corners', ' Andries Pretorius had brought a 6-pound naval carronade with him from the Cape, mounted on a gun carriage improvised from a wagon axle, and named Grietjie', ' The other ordnance piece is unknown in the original, but the reproduction depicts a 4-pound smoothbore cannon by then obsolete in most European armies', ' Both were used to fire devastating grapeshot', '  As evening approached, a thick mist settled over the wagon site above which the sky was clear', ' According to Afrikaner traditions, the Zulu were afraid to attack at the night due to superstitions and the eerie glow of lamps which the Boers hung on sjamboks [whip-stocks] around the laager', ' Whether or not there is any truth in this, historian S', 'P', ' Mackenzie has speculated that the Zulu held back until what they perceived as the necessary numbers had arrived', ' Some of the Zulus only arrived near sunrise by following the tracks of the wagons', ' Due to some recent heavy rains the Ncombe River was swollen making crossing the river difficult', '  During the night of 15 December, six Zulu regiments, an estimated 20,000 (or more) Zulu soldiers led by Dambuza (Nzobo), crossed the Ncome River and started massing around the encampment, while the elite forces of senior general Ndlela did not cross the river, thereby splitting the army in two', '  Battle On 16 December, dawn broke on a clear day, revealing that ""all of Zululand sat there"", according to one Trekker eyewitness', "" General Ndlela and his crack troops, the Black and White Shields, remained on the other side of the river, observing Dambuza's men at the laager from a safe position across the hippo pool"", ' According to the South African Department of Art and Culture: In ceremonies that lasted about three days, izinyanga zempi, specialist war doctors, prepared izinteleze medicines which made warriors invincible in the face of their opponents', ""  This could partly help explain why Dambuza's forces were sitting on the ground close to the wagon laager when the Trekkers first saw them"", "" thumb|An artist's impression of the Battle of Blood River"", "" Dambuza's regiments repeatedly stormed the laager but could not break through"", "" The attackers were hindered by a change introduced during Shaka's rule that replaced most of the longer throwing spears with short stabbing spears"", ' In close combat the stabbing spear provided obvious advantages over its longer cousin', ' A Zulu eyewitness said that their first charge was mown down like grass by the Boer muskets', '  As Bantjes wrote in his journal:  With the power of their firearms and with their ox wagons in a laager formation and some effective tactics, the Boers fought off the Zulu', ' Buckshot was used to maximise casualties', ' Mackenzie claims that 200 indigenous servants looked after the horses and cattle and helped load muskets, but no definite proof or witness of servants helping to reload is available', ' Writing in the popular Afrikaans magazine Die Huisgenoot, a Dr', ' D', 'J', ' Kotze said that this group consisted of fifty-nine ""non-white helpers and followers"" instead of the commonly stated two hundred', '  After two hours and four waves of attack, with the intermittent lulls providing crucial reloading and resting opportunities for the Trekkers, Pretorius ordered a

laager, Pretorius chose a defensible position close to a vertical 8m descent into a deep hippo pool in the Ncombe River providing excellent protection on two sides', ' The wide-open area to the front of the laager provided absolutely no cover for an attacking force', ' The battle was set with the laager protected on two flanks', ' As usual, the ox-wagons were drawn into the typical protective enclosure or laager', ' Movable wooden barriers and ladders which could be quickly opened for cavalry were fastened between the wagon wheels to prevent intruders, with two smoothbore, short barrel

devastating grapeshot', '  As evening approached, a thick mist settled over the wagon site above which the sky was clear', ' According to Afrikaner traditions, the Zulu were afraid to attack at the night due to superstitions and the eerie glow of lamps which the Boers hung on sjamboks [whip-stocks] around the laager', ' Whether or not there is any truth in this, historian S', 'P', ' Mackenzie has speculated that the Zulu held back until what they perceived as the necessary numbers had arrived', ' Some of the Zulus only arrived near sunrise by following the tracks of the wagons', ' Due to some recent heavy rains the Ncombe River was swollen making crossing the river difficult', '  During the night of 15 December, six Zulu regiments, an estimated 20,000 (or more) Zulu soldiers led by Dambuza (Nzobo), crossed the Ncome River and started massing around the encampment, while the elite forces of senior general Ndlela did not cross the river, thereby splitting the army in two', '

muskets', '  As Bantjes wrote in his journal:  With the power of their firearms and with their ox wagons in a laager formation and some effective tactics, the Boers fought off the Zulu', ' Buckshot

reload is available', ' Writing in the popular Afrikaans magazine Die Huisgenoot, a Dr', ' D', 'J', ' Kotze said that this group consisted of fifty-nine ""non-white helpers and followers"" instead of

group of horsemen to leave the encampment and engage the Zulu in order to induce the disintegration of their formations', ' The Zulu withstood the charge for some time, but rapid losses led them to scatter', ' The Trekkers pursued their fleeing enemies and hunted them down for three hours', ' Cilliers noted later that ""we left the Kafirs lying on the ground as thick almost as pumpkins upon the

the government of the ZAR became concerned about the safety of its capital city, Pretoria, both from foreign invasion as well as from the growing number of Uitlanders (Foreigners) on the Witwatersrand', ' Consequently, a defence plan for Pretoria was drawn up by a former French artillery officer, Léon Grunberg', ' This plan was approved on 24 March 1896 by the Executive Council of the ZAR', '  The plan recommended that eight strategic positions around the city should be fortified by means of armoured turrets equipped with artillery', ' The positions identified were Schanskop, Kwaggaspoort, Daspoortrand, Magaliesberg-wes, Wonderboompoort, Derdepoort, Strubenkop and Klapperkop', ' The armoured turrets were subsequently found to be unacceptable, and thus the plan of two

by halting his advance towards UmGungundlovu on 15 December 1838, 40\xa0km before reaching the defile at Italeni, Pretorius had eliminated the Italeni terrain trap', '  Location and preparation On Saturday, 15 December 1838, after the Trekker wagons crossed the Buffalo River 10\xa0km SW of the actual battle site and still  from their target UmGungundlovu, an advance scouting party including Pretorius got news of a large Zulu force in rugged terrain to the east trying to lure the Boers into a trap as had been the case in April the same year with fatal consequences', "" While Cilliers wanted to ride out and attack, Pretorius declined the opportunity to engage Dingane's soldiers away from their base as had been the trap at Italeni valley"", ' Instead, Pretorius decided on a fortified laager on the terrain of his own choosing in the hope that general Ndlela would attack Pretorius on his terms rather than the other way around', '  As the site for the defensive wagon laager, Pretorius chose a defensible position close to a vertical 8m descent into a deep hippo pool in the Ncombe River providing excellent protection on two sides', ' The wide-open area to the front of the laager provided absolutely no cover for an attacking force', ' The battle was set with the laager protected on two flanks', ' As usual, the ox-wagons were drawn into the typical protective enclosure or laager', ' Movable wooden barriers and ladders which could be quickly opened for cavalry were fastened between the wagon wheels to prevent intruders, with two smoothbore, short barrel artillery pieces positioned at the corners', ' Andries Pretorius had brought a 6-pound naval carronade with him from the Cape, mounted on a gun carriage improvised from a wagon axle, and named Grietjie', ' The other ordnance piece is unknown in the original, but the reproduction depicts a 4-pound smoothbore cannon by then obsolete in most European armies', ' Both were used to fire devastating grapeshot', '  As evening approached, a thick mist settled over the wagon site above which the sky was clear', ' According to Afrikaner traditions, the Zulu were afraid to attack at the night due to superstitions and the eerie glow of lamps which the Boers hung on sjamboks [whip-stocks] around the laager', ' Whether or not there is any truth in this, historian S', 'P', ' Mackenzie has speculated that the Zulu held back until what they perceived as the necessary numbers had arrived', ' Some of the Zulus only arrived near sunrise by following the tracks of the wagons', ' Due to some recent heavy rains the Ncombe River was swollen making crossing the river difficult', '  During the night of 15 December, six Zulu regiments, an estimated 20,000 (or more) Zulu soldiers led by Dambuza (Nzobo), crossed the Ncome River and started massing around the encampment, while the elite forces of senior general Ndlela did not cross the river, thereby splitting the army in two', '  Battle On 16 December, dawn broke on a clear day, revealing that ""all of Zululand sat there"", according to one Trekker eyewitness', "" General Ndlela and his crack troops, the Black and White Shields, remained on the other side of the river, observing Dambuza's men at the laager from a safe position across the hippo pool"", ' According to the South African Department of Art and Culture: In ceremonies that lasted about three days, izinyanga zempi, specialist war doctors, prepared izinteleze medicines which made warriors invincible in the face of their opponents', ""  This could partly help explain why Dambuza's forces were sitting on the ground close to the wagon laager when the Trekkers first saw them"", "" thumb|An artist's impression of the Battle of Blood River"", "" Dambuza's regiments repeatedly stormed the laager but could not break through"", "" The attackers were hindered by a change introduced during Shaka's rule that replaced most of the longer throwing spears with short stabbing spears"", ' In close combat the stabbing spear provided obvious advantages over its longer cousin', ' A Zulu eyewitness said that their first charge was mown down like grass by the Boer muskets', '  As Bantjes wrote in his journal:  With the power of their firearms and with their ox wagons in a laager formation and some effective tactics, the Boers fought off the Zulu', ' Buckshot was used to maximise casualties', ' Mackenzie claims that 200 indigenous servants looked after the horses and cattle and helped load muskets, but no definite proof or witness of servants helping to reload is available', ' Writing in the popular Afrikaans magazine Die Huisgenoot, a Dr', ' D', 'J', ' Kotze said that this group consisted of fifty-nine ""non-white helpers and followers"" instead of the commonly stated two hundred', '  After two hours and four waves of attack, with the intermittent lulls providing crucial reloading and resting opportunities for the Trekkers, Pretorius ordered a group of horsemen to leave the encampment and engage the Zulu in order to induce the disintegration of their formations', ' The Zulu withstood the charge for some time, but rapid losses led them to scatter', ' The Trekkers pursued their fleeing enemies and hunted them down for three hours', ' Cilliers noted later that ""we left the Kafirs lying on the ground as thick almost as pumpkins upon the field that has borne a plentiful crop', '"" Bantjes recorded that about 3,000 dead Zulu had been counted, and three Trekkers were wounded', ' During the chase, Pretorius was wounded in his left hand by an assegaai (Zulu spear)', "" Of the 3,000 dead Zulu soldiers, two were princes, leaving Ndlela's favourite Prince Mpande as frontrunner in the subsequent battle for the Zulu crown"", ""  Four days after the Battle of Blood River, the Trekker commando arrived at King Dingane's great kraal UmGungundlovu (near present-day Eshowe), only to find it deserted and in ashes"", ' The bones of Retief and his men were found and buried, where a memorial stands today', ' Up to this day 16 December is a public holiday in South Africa; before 1994 it was known as ""the Day of the Vow"", ""the Day of the Covenant"" and ""Dingaan\'s Day""; but today it is ""the Day of Reconciliation""', '  Aftermath The conflict between Dingane and the Trekkers continued for one more year after the Battle of Blood River', "" The idea of a decisive victory may have been planted in Pretorius' mind by a Zulu prisoner, who said that most of Dingane's warriors had either been killed or fled"", ' The same prisoner led some of the Trekker party into a trap at the White Umfolozi River, eleven days after the battle at Ncome River', ' This time the Zulu were victorious', "" Only when Dingane's brother, Mpande, openly joined the Trekker side with his sizeable army, was Dingane finally defeated in January 1840"", ""  Following the Battle of Maqongqe in January 1840, the forces of Mpande did not wait for Pretorius' cavalry to arrive, and they attacked the remaining regiments of Dingane, who were again under the command of General Ndlela"", ' Ndlela strayed from normal fighting tactics against Mpande, sending in his regiments to fight one at a time, instead of together in ox horn formation', ' Maquongqe Dingane had to flee Natal completely, but before he did so, he had Ndlela slowly strangled by cow hide for high treason, on the grounds that he had fought for Mpande, with the same disastrous result for Dingane as at Ncome-Blood River', "" Dambusa, Dingane's other general, had already been executed by Mpande and Pretorius when he fell into their hands before the battle"", '  Pretorius approved and attended the crowning of Zulu King Mpande in Pietermaritzburg', ' They agreed on the Tugela River as the border between Zululand and the Republic of Natalia', '  Legacy Popular Afrikaner interpretations of the Battle of Blood River (bolstered by sympathetic historians such as George Theal) played a central role in fostering Afrikaner nationalism ', "" They believe that the battle demonstrated God's intervention and hence their divine right to exist as an independent people"", ' This is stated in the official guidebook of the Voortrekker Monument (unveiled during the centenary celebrations of the Great Trek on 16 December 1949) that Afrikaners were a nation of heroes exemplifies the conclusions drawn from such events', ' From the Day of the Vow, Afrikaners consider the site and the commemoration of the day as sacred', '  Historian S', 'P', ' Mackenzie doubts the reported number of Zulu deaths', "" He compares Zulu casualties at Ncome to battles at Italeni, Isandlwana, and Rorke's Drift"", ' Mackenzie acknowledges that the casualty count was not impossible', ' Yet, in a similar victory on 15 October 1836 by Trekkers under Hendrik Potgieter over some 9,000 Matabele, the latter suffered only 350 casualties', ' In 1879, 600 British soldiers with breech-loading rifles caused 2,000 Zulu casualties, perhaps 1,000 killedIan Knight,Isandlwana 1879: The Great Zulu Victory, Osprey, 2002, , p', '86', "" Knight's estimate of Zulu casualties is more in keeping with those suffered by the Zulu at Kambula where a British column forms an excellent defensive position with a wagon lager, six 7 pounder artillery pieces and 2,000 soldiers and inflicts 800 (counted

engaging Dingane in UmGungundlovu after losing the battle of Italeni, and subsequently had migrated with his group out of Natal', ' To approach UmGungundlovu via the Italeni defile with ox wagons

riflemen had over spear-carrying foot soldiers', ' Ndlela had to let Pretorius come close to UmGungundlovu at Italeni and lure the Trekkers into attack', ' Ndlela was not to attack the Trekkers when they were in a defensive wagon laager position, especially not during the day', "" The problem for Pretorius was that he had somehow to find a way to make Dingane's soldiers attack him in a defensive laager position at a place of his choice, far away from UmGungundlovu and Italeni"", '  On 6 December 1838, 10 days before the Battle of Blood River, Pretorius and his commando including Alexander Biggar as translator had a meeting with friendly Zulu chiefs at Danskraal, so named for the Zulu dancing that took place in the Zulu kraal that the Trekker commando visited', ' With the intelligence received at Danskraal, Pretorius became confident enough to propose a vow to God, which demanded the celebration, by the commando and their posterity, of the coming victory over Dingane', ' The covenant included that a church would be built in honour of God, should the commando be successful and reach UmGungundlovu alive in order to diminish the power of Dingane', ' Building a church in Trekker emigrant context was symbol for establishing a settled state', '  After the meeting with friendly Zulu chiefs at Danskraal, Pretorius let the commando relax and do their washing for a few days at Wasbank till 9 December 1838', ' From Wasbank they slowly and daily moved closer to the site of the Battle of Blood River, practising laager defence tactics every evening for a week long', ' Then, by halting his advance towards UmGungundlovu on 15 December 1838, 40\xa0km before reaching the defile at Italeni, Pretorius had eliminated the Italeni terrain trap', '  Location and preparation On Saturday, 15 December 1838, after the Trekker wagons crossed the Buffalo River 10\xa0km SW of the actual battle site and still  from their target UmGungundlovu, an advance scouting party including Pretorius got news of a large Zulu force in rugged terrain to the east trying to lure the Boers into a trap as had been the case in April the same year with fatal consequences', "" While Cilliers wanted to ride out and attack, Pretorius declined the opportunity to engage Dingane's soldiers away from their base as had been the trap at Italeni valley"", ' Instead, Pretorius decided on a fortified laager on the terrain of his own choosing in the hope that general Ndlela would attack Pretorius on his terms rather than the other way around', '  As the site for the defensive wagon laager, Pretorius chose a defensible position close to a vertical 8m descent into a deep hippo pool in the Ncombe River providing excellent protection on two sides', ' The wide-open area to the front of the laager provided absolutely no cover for an attacking force', ' The battle was set with the laager protected on two flanks', ' As usual, the ox-wagons were drawn into the typical protective enclosure or laager', ' Movable wooden barriers and ladders which could be quickly opened for cavalry were fastened between the wagon wheels to prevent intruders, with two smoothbore, short barrel artillery pieces positioned at the corners', ' Andries Pretorius had brought a 6-pound naval carronade with him from the Cape, mounted on a gun carriage improvised from a wagon axle, and named Grietjie', ' The other ordnance piece is unknown in the original, but the reproduction depicts a 4-pound smoothbore cannon by then obsolete in most European armies', ' Both were used to fire devastating grapeshot', '  As evening approached, a thick mist settled over the wagon site above which the sky was clear', ' According to Afrikaner traditions, the Zulu were afraid to attack at the night due to superstitions and the eerie glow of lamps which the Boers hung on sjamboks [whip-stocks] around the laager', ' Whether or not there is any truth in this, historian S', 'P', ' Mackenzie has speculated that the Zulu held back until what they perceived as the necessary numbers had arrived', ' Some of the Zulus only arrived near sunrise by following the tracks of the wagons', ' Due to some recent heavy rains the Ncombe River was swollen making crossing the river difficult', '  During the night of 15 December, six Zulu regiments, an estimated 20,000 (or more) Zulu soldiers led by Dambuza (Nzobo), crossed the Ncome River and started massing around the encampment, while the elite forces of senior general Ndlela did not cross the river, thereby splitting the army in two', '  Battle On 16 December, dawn broke on a clear day, revealing that ""all of Zululand sat there"", according to one Trekker eyewitness', "" General Ndlela and his crack troops, the Black and White Shields, remained on the other side of the river, observing Dambuza's men at the laager from a safe position across the hippo pool"", ' According to the South African Department of Art and Culture: In ceremonies that lasted about three days, izinyanga zempi, specialist war doctors, prepared izinteleze medicines which made warriors invincible in the face of their opponents', ""  This could partly help explain why Dambuza's forces were sitting on the ground close to the wagon laager when the Trekkers first saw them"", "" thumb|An artist's impression of the Battle of Blood River"", "" Dambuza's regiments repeatedly stormed the laager but could not break through"", "" The attackers were hindered by a change introduced during Shaka's rule that replaced most of the longer throwing spears with short stabbing spears"", ' In close combat the stabbing spear provided obvious advantages over its longer cousin', ' A Zulu eyewitness said that their first charge was mown down like grass by the Boer muskets', '  As Bantjes wrote in his journal:  With the power of their firearms and with their ox wagons in a laager formation and some effective tactics, the Boers fought off the Zulu', ' Buckshot was used to maximise casualties', ' Mackenzie claims that 200 indigenous servants looked after the horses and cattle and helped load muskets, but no definite proof or witness of servants helping to reload is available', ' Writing in the popular Afrikaans magazine Die Huisgenoot, a Dr', ' D', 'J', ' Kotze said that this group consisted of fifty-nine ""non-white helpers and followers"" instead of the commonly stated two hundred', '  After two hours and four waves of attack, with the intermittent lulls providing crucial reloading and resting opportunities for the Trekkers, Pretorius ordered a group of horsemen to leave the encampment and engage the Zulu in order to induce the disintegration of their formations', ' The Zulu withstood the charge for some time, but rapid losses led them to scatter', ' The Trekkers pursued their fleeing enemies and hunted them down for three hours', ' Cilliers noted later that ""we left the Kafirs lying on the ground as thick almost as pumpkins upon the field that has borne a plentiful crop', '"" Bantjes recorded that about 3,000 dead Zulu had been counted, and three Trekkers were wounded', ' During the chase, Pretorius was wounded in his left hand

"" In support of Prince Mpande as Dingane's replacement, Pretorius' strategy was to target Dingane only"", "" To allow Prince Mpande to oust King Dingane through military might, Pretorius had first to weaken Dingane's personal military power base in UmGungundlovu"", "" Dingane's royal residence at UmGungundlovu was naturally protected against attack by hilly and rocky terrain all around, as well as an access route via Italeni passing through a narrow gorge called a defile"", '  Earlier on 9 April 1838, a Trekker horse commando without ox wagons, thereafter called the ""Flight Commando"", had

engaging Dingane in UmGungundlovu after losing the battle of Italeni, and subsequently had migrated with his group out of Natal', ' To approach UmGungundlovu via the Italeni defile with ox wagons

limited"", ' Proven UmGungundlovu defense tactics were to attack Trekker commandos in the rocky and hilly terrain on the narrowing access route at Italeni, thereby neutralising the advantages mounted riflemen had over spear-carrying foot soldiers', ' Ndlela had to let Pretorius come close to UmGungundlovu at Italeni and lure the Trekkers into attack', ' Ndlela was not to attack the Trekkers when they were in a defensive wagon laager position, especially not during the day', "" The problem for Pretorius was that he had somehow to find a way to make Dingane's soldiers attack him in a defensive laager position at a place of his choice, far away from UmGungundlovu and Italeni"", '  On 6 December 1838, 10 days before the Battle of Blood River, Pretorius and his commando including Alexander Biggar as translator had a meeting with friendly Zulu chiefs at Danskraal, so named for the Zulu dancing that took place in the Zulu kraal that the Trekker commando visited', ' With the intelligence received at Danskraal, Pretorius became confident enough to propose a vow to God, which demanded the celebration, by the commando and their posterity, of the coming victory over Dingane', ' The covenant included that a church would be built in honour of God, should the commando be successful and reach UmGungundlovu alive in order to diminish the power of Dingane', ' Building a church in

Saturday, 15 December 1838, after the Trekker wagons crossed the Buffalo River 10\xa0km SW of the actual battle site and still  from their target UmGungundlovu, an advance scouting party including Pretorius got news of a large Zulu force in rugged terrain to the east trying to lure the Boers into a trap as had been the case in April the same year with fatal consequences', "" While Cilliers wanted to ride out and attack, Pretorius declined the opportunity to engage Dingane's soldiers away from their base as had been the trap at Italeni valley"", ' Instead, Pretorius decided on a fortified laager on the terrain of his own choosing in the hope that general Ndlela would attack Pretorius on his terms rather than the other way around', '  As the site for the defensive wagon laager, Pretorius chose a defensible position close to a vertical 8m descent into a deep hippo pool in the Ncombe River providing excellent protection on two sides', ' The wide-open area to the front of the laager provided absolutely no cover for an attacking force', ' The battle was set with the laager protected on two flanks', ' As usual, the ox-wagons were drawn into the typical protective enclosure or laager', ' Movable wooden barriers and ladders which could be quickly opened for cavalry were fastened between the wagon wheels to prevent intruders, with two smoothbore, short barrel artillery pieces positioned at the corners', ' Andries Pretorius had brought a 6-pound naval carronade with him from the Cape, mounted on a gun carriage improvised from a wagon axle, and named Grietjie', ' The other ordnance piece is unknown in the original, but the reproduction depicts a 4-pound smoothbore cannon by then obsolete in most European armies', ' Both were used to fire devastating grapeshot', '  As evening approached, a thick mist settled over the wagon site above which the sky was clear', ' According to Afrikaner traditions, the Zulu were afraid to attack at the night due to superstitions and the eerie glow of lamps which the Boers hung on sjamboks [whip-stocks] around the laager', ' Whether or not there is any truth in this, historian S', 'P', ' Mackenzie has speculated that the Zulu held back until what they perceived as the necessary numbers had arrived', ' Some of the Zulus only arrived near sunrise by following the tracks of the wagons', ' Due to some recent heavy rains the Ncombe River was swollen making crossing the river difficult', '  During the night of 15 December, six Zulu regiments, an estimated 20,000 (or more) Zulu soldiers led by Dambuza (Nzobo), crossed the Ncome River and started massing around the encampment, while the elite forces of senior general Ndlela did not cross the river, thereby splitting the army in two', '  Battle On 16 December, dawn broke on a clear day, revealing that ""all of Zululand sat there"", according to one Trekker eyewitness', "" General Ndlela and his crack troops, the Black and White Shields, remained on the other side of the river, observing Dambuza's men at the laager from a safe position across the hippo pool"", ' According to the South African Department of Art and Culture: In ceremonies that lasted about three days, izinyanga zempi, specialist war doctors, prepared izinteleze medicines which made warriors invincible in the face of their opponents', ""  This could partly help explain why Dambuza's forces were sitting on the ground close to the wagon laager when the Trekkers first saw them"", "" thumb|An artist's impression of the Battle of Blood River"", "" Dambuza's regiments repeatedly stormed the laager but could not break through"", "" The attackers were hindered by a change introduced during Shaka's rule that replaced most of the longer throwing spears with short stabbing spears"", ' In close combat the stabbing spear provided obvious advantages over its longer cousin', ' A Zulu eyewitness said that their first charge was mown down like grass by the Boer muskets', '  As Bantjes wrote in his journal:  With the power of their firearms and with their ox wagons in a laager formation and some effective tactics, the Boers fought off the Zulu', ' Buckshot was used to maximise casualties', ' Mackenzie claims that 200 indigenous servants looked after the horses and cattle and helped load muskets, but no definite proof or witness of servants helping to reload is available', ' Writing in the popular Afrikaans magazine Die Huisgenoot, a Dr', ' D', 'J', ' Kotze said that this group consisted of fifty-nine ""non-white helpers and followers"" instead of the commonly stated two hundred', '  After two hours and four waves of attack, with the intermittent lulls providing crucial reloading and resting opportunities for the Trekkers, Pretorius ordered a group of horsemen to leave the encampment and engage the Zulu in order to induce the disintegration of their formations', ' The Zulu withstood the charge for some time, but rapid losses led them to scatter', ' The Trekkers pursued their fleeing enemies and hunted them down for three hours', ' Cilliers noted later that ""we left the Kafirs lying on the ground as thick almost as pumpkins upon the field that has borne a plentiful crop', '"" Bantjes recorded that about 3,000 dead Zulu had been counted, and three Trekkers were wounded', ' During the chase, Pretorius was wounded in his left hand by an assegaai (Zulu spear)', "" Of the 3,000 dead Zulu soldiers, two were princes, leaving Ndlela's favourite Prince Mpande as frontrunner in the subsequent battle for the Zulu crown"", ""  Four days after the Battle of Blood River, the Trekker commando arrived at King Dingane's great kraal UmGungundlovu (near present-day Eshowe), only to find it deserted and in ashes"", ' The bones of Retief and

Covenant"" and ""Dingaan\'s Day""; but today it is ""the Day of Reconciliation""', '  Aftermath The conflict between Dingane and the Trekkers continued for one more year after the Battle of Blood River', "" The idea of a decisive victory may have been planted in Pretorius' mind by a Zulu prisoner, who said that most of Dingane's warriors had either been killed or fled"", ' The same prisoner led some of the Trekker party into a trap at the White Umfolozi River, eleven days after the battle at Ncome River', ' This time the Zulu were victorious', "" Only when Dingane's brother, Mpande, openly joined the Trekker side with his sizeable army, was Dingane finally defeated in January 1840"", ""  Following the Battle of Maqongqe in January 1840, the forces of Mpande did not wait for Pretorius' cavalry to arrive, and they attacked the remaining regiments of Dingane, who were again under the command of General Ndlela"", ' Ndlela strayed from normal fighting tactics against Mpande, sending in his regiments to fight one at a time, instead of together in ox horn formation', ' Maquongqe Dingane had to flee Natal completely, but before he did so, he had Ndlela slowly strangled by cow hide for high treason, on the grounds that he had fought for Mpande, with the same disastrous result for Dingane as at Ncome-Blood River', "" Dambusa, Dingane's other general, had already been executed by Mpande and Pretorius when he fell into their hands before the battle"", '  Pretorius approved and attended the crowning of Zulu King Mpande in Pietermaritzburg', ' They agreed on the Tugela River as the border between Zululand and the Republic of Natalia', '  Legacy Popular Afrikaner interpretations of the Battle of Blood River (bolstered by sympathetic historians such as George Theal) played a central role in fostering Afrikaner nationalism ', "" They believe that the battle demonstrated God's intervention and hence their divine right to exist as an independent people"", '

underestimated the Zulus\' capabilities', ' The experience of numerous colonial wars fought in Africa was that the massed firepower of relatively small bodies of professional European troops, armed with modern firearms and artillery and supplemented by local allies and levies, would march out to meet the natives whose poorly equipped armies would put up a fight but in the end would succumb', ' Chelmsford believed that a force of over 4,000, including 2,000 British infantry armed with Martini–Henry rifles, as well as artillery, had more than sufficient firepower to overwhelm any attack by Zulus armed only with spears, cowhide shields and a few firearms such as Brown Bess muskets', "" Indeed, with a British force of this size, it was the logistical arrangements which occupied Chelmsford's thoughts"", ' Rather than any fear that the camp might be attacked, his main concern was managing the huge number of wagons and oxen required to support his forward advance', 'Colenso,

reluctant to agree since his orders had been specifically to defend the camp', '  Chelmsford had underestimated the disciplined, well-led, well-motivated and confident Zulus', "" The failure to secure

forts built by the government of the South African Republic (ZAR) just before the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Boer War around their capital of Pretoria', '  History After the abortive Jameson Raid, the government of the ZAR became concerned about the safety of its capital city, Pretoria, both from foreign invasion as well as from the growing number of Uitlanders (Foreigners) on the Witwatersrand', ' Consequently, a defence plan for Pretoria was drawn up by a former French artillery officer, Léon Grunberg', ' This plan was approved on 24 March 1896 by the Executive Council of the ZAR', '  The plan recommended that eight strategic positions around the city should be fortified by means of armoured turrets equipped with artillery', ' The positions identified were Schanskop, Kwaggaspoort, Daspoortrand, Magaliesberg-wes, Wonderboompoort, Derdepoort, Strubenkop and Klapperkop', ' The armoured turrets were subsequently found to be unacceptable, and thus the plan of two German engineers, Otto Albert Adolph von Dewitz and Heinrich C Werner to build forts instead, were accepted', ' However, due to a lack of money, only four forts were eventually built', '  The three German forts Fort Schanskop, Fort Wonderboompoort and Fort Klapperkop were designed by Von Dewitz and Werner of the German engineering company Krupp, assisted by architect Christiaan Kuntz and building contractor Celso Giri', '  The three forts are pentagonal reinforced, with more fire range possibilities through numerous facets', ' Attacks from any direction could be warded off by revolving guns on their ramparts', ' To prevent infantry attacks, loopholes were built into the walls', ' Trenches, barbed-wire entanglements and fortified rooms were erected as reinforcements', '  These forts were the most modern structures of their time and modern mediums of communication, such as telephones, were used to equip the telegraph room', '  Many black labourers and about 400 white builders, mostly Italians, were involved in the building of these forts', ' To address technical aspects such as the electrical connections between forts, German and Dutch experts were consulted', '  Fort Schanskop  This fort was built at a cost of GBP £47,500', ' It was handed over to the government on 6 April 1897', ' It was supplied with a paraffin engine powered generator for electricity, electrical lighting and a search light', ' A telephone and telegraphic links were also installed', ' Water was supplied from a pump station in the Fountains Valley which was shared with the nearby Fort Klapperkop', '    The garrison was initially armed with one officer and 30 men and was armed with 37\xa0mm Maxim-Nordenfeldt cannon, Martini-Henry hand-cranked Maxim machine guns and a 155 mm Creusot gun (also known colloquially as a ""Long Tom"")', ' By October 1899, only 17 men were still stationed at the fort', '  Both the garrison and the armaments were gradually reduced during the course of the Second Anglo-Boer war until there was only one man and no guns left over on 5 June 1900, the day on which British forces occupied Pretoria', ' The fort was briefly occupied in 1993 by Willem Ratte to protest the multi-racial government of South Africa at the cost of Boer and Afrikaner heritage', '  The fort was acquired by the Voortrekker Monument complex in June 2000', ' A refurbished statue of Danie Theron, originally from the Danie Theron Combat School in Kimberley, was placed on the perimeter of the fort and unveiled on 6 March 2002', ' A scale model replica of the
