The first encounter went smoothly enough—gestures were exchanged expressing peaceful intentions, and several of the natives were invited aboard, and given food and drink by the Portuguese, before setting back in their canoes and returning to the mainland. Alvaro Fernandes returned to Portugal thereafter, with the two captives from Bezeguiche, the barrels of Senegal River water and the hunters' weapons to show for it. The caravel resumed sail, and continued ""for a certain distance"", until they reached a large river, which is recorded in the chronicles as ""Rio Tabite"" (location uncertain, see below). Although probably aware of the fate of Nuno Tristão on a similar river venture, Alvaro Fernandes nonetheless decided to set a launch to explore upriver. Zurara reports Fernandes sailed as far as 110 leagues beyond Cape Vert.Zurara, p.261  If Zurara was exactly correct, that would mean Fernandes reached the environs of Cape Verga (, in modern Guinea), an incredible leap beyond his last point.Teixeira da Mota, 1946: p.280  Chronicler João de Barros goes even further, identifying the river Fernandes sailed up as the ""Rio Tabite"". Reviewing the evidence, Teixeira da Mota suggests that the ""Tabite"" river Fernandes sailed up was probably the Casamance River (, Senegal) and the low cape and sandy bay that marked his final point was the stretch around Cape Varela (, just below Cape Roxo, at the northern end of what is now Guinea-Bissau).Teixeira da Mota (1946: II, p.283). Given Tristão's fate, Zurara may have simply assumed all tribes south of Cape Verde used poison.Teixeira da Mota, p.282-83)  The other footnote is why Fernandes' caravel was ambushed on the river by the Jola of the Casamance, who were unfamiliar with the Portuguese. Teixeira da Mota points to the abduction of the woman on the bank may have alerted the river peoples to the hostile intentions of the Portuguese."

During low tide the island is connected to the mainland, but during high tide it is separated by about 150 metres from the headland of Dog Island Point on the north bank of the river. In 1661, the English captain Robert Holmes arrived on behalf of the Royal African Company to establish an English presence in the Gambia river (and, less explicitly, to eject the Courlanders from the area). Currently, tourists are occasionally ferried from Banjul to Dog Island to observe the dolphins swimming in the Gambia River estuary."
