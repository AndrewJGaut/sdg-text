months later—would be greeted by a hail of arrows and poisoned darts, and forced away', '  Álvaro Fernandes sailed further south than any prior Portuguese captain, setting up the Cape of Mastos as the farthest marker', ' For that, he and his uncle, João Gonçalves Zarco, were amply rewarded by Prince Henry', 'Zurara, p', '229   2nd expedition  In the following year, João Gonçalves Zarco set out

(probably Serer), intent on defending their village', '  Álvaro Fernandes killed what he believed was the native chieftain at the beginning of the encounter, prompting the rest of the local warriors to briefly halt the fight', '  The Portuguese landing party availed themselves of the pause to hurry back to their ship', 'Zurara, p', '259', '  [[File:Sénégal-Bagnones', 'jpg|thumb|200px|The environs

continued ""for a certain distance"", until they reached a large river, which is recorded in the chronicles as ""Rio Tabite"" (location uncertain, see below)', ' Although probably aware of the fate of Nuno Tristão on a similar river venture, Alvaro Fernandes nonetheless decided to set a launch to explore upriver', '  The first exploratory boat made a landing on the bank near some local huts, where they quickly captured a local woman and brought her back to the caravel', '  Then refitting the boat, they set out again, this time intending to sail further upriver', ' But they did not get far before they came upon four or five native canoes with armed men heading towards them', '  Fernandes immediately turned the boat around and began racing back to the caravel, with the canoes hot on his tail', ""  One of the canoes went fast enough to nearly catch up with Fernandes's boat, prompting Fernandes to turn and prepare for a fight"", '  But the lead native canoe, realizing it was alone, slowed down to wait for the others, thus giving the Portuguese boat the opportunity to resume their flight back to the caravel', '  The Portuguese escaped, but Álvaro Fernandes himself was gravely wounded in the leg by a poisoned arrow shot from one of the canoes', '  Once aboard ship, he disinfected the wound with urine and olive oil', '  He lay in fever for a few days, on the edge of death, but recovered', 'Zurara, p', '260  Despite the near-fatal experience, the caravel proceeded straight south for a little longer, until they reached a sandy cape and large sandy bay', 'Zurara, p', '261 They put a small boat to explore near the beach, but found a force of some 120 natives, armed with shields, assegais and bows marching towards them', '  The explorers immediately returned to the caravel', '  Nonetheless, the armed native party gave what seemed like a peaceful festive demonstration from the beach - waving and inviting the Portuguese to land', ""  But given Fernandes's ill condition and still shaken by their earlier near-escape, the decision was made to quit the area and set sail back to Portugal"", '  On the way home, Fernandes stopped by Arguin island and a nearby cape in the bay, where they negotiated the purchase of a black slave-woman from some Berber traders', '  Upon arrival in Portugal, Álvaro Fernandes was amply rewarded by Prince Henry the Navigator who offered him 100 dubloons, and regent Peter of Coimbra, who gave him another 100, for having sailed further than any other Portuguese captain thus far', 'Zurara, p', '261   Extent of explorations   Of all the Henrican captains of the 1440s,  Álvaro Fernandes seemed to have pushed the discovery marker farthest', ' It is almost certain that, on his first expedition (1445), Álvaro Fernandes surpassed all others and was the first European to land on Bezeguiche (Gorée island, in the bay of Dakar), sailing as far as the Cape of Masts (Cape Naze) in central Senegal', '  The extent of his second 1446 journey is more uncertain', '  Zurara reports Fernandes sailed as far as 110 leagues beyond Cape Vert', 'Zurara, p', '261  If Zurara was exactly correct, that would mean Fernandes reached the environs of Cape Verga (, in modern Guinea), an incredible leap beyond his last point', 'Teixeira da Mota, 1946: p', '280  Chronicler João de Barros goes even further, identifying the river Fernandes sailed up as the ""Rio Tabite""', '  The exact identification of ""Rio Tabite"" is uncertain, for that name is not found on old charts', 'Quintella (p', '149n)   Barros notes merely that Rio Tabite is 32 leagues beyond the ""Rio de Nuno Tristão""', 'Barros (p', '121)', '   If we assume the latter to be the Nunez River (in modern Guinea), that would lead us to identify the ""Rio Tabite"" with the Forecariah River  in modern Guinea, implying Fernandes sailed a tremendous 135 leagues beyond Cape Vert, well beyond the 110 suggested by Zurara', 'The identification of the Tabite with the Forecariah is due to Teixeira da Mota (1946: II, p', '278-80), basing himself on indications in Duarte Pacheco Pereira and elsewhere', '  Cortesão (1931: p', '20-21) however, identifies the Tabite with the Pongo River (),  a tad bit closer, but  also in Guinea and still exceeding 110 leagues', '  At the other extreme, the Viscount of Santarém identified the Rio Tabite with the Rio do Lago (Diombos River, in the Sine-Saloum Delta of Senegal), a mere 24 leagues from Cape Vert', 'Viscount of Santarém, in the first edition of Zurara, (1841: p', '408), basing himself on a Juan de la Cosa map', '  But then Santarém (p', '410) goes on to dramatically claim they continued sailing as far as Cape St', ' Ann in Sierra Leone, a gigantic leap from Diombos', ' Another source, the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica (op', ' cit), describes Fernandes as having sailed to ""perhaps in the neighborhood of Conakry', '', '', 'but little short of Sierra Leone', '"" However, the Diombos is the prime candidate location for the death of Nuno Tristão himself', 'Teixeira da Mota, (1946: Pt', ""1)  If that was also sailed by Fernandes, then that eliminates Fernandes's claim to have exceeded Nuno Tristão's last point by many leagues"", '  The Tabite has also been tentatively identified with the Gambia River,Beazley & Prestage (1896: p', 'xii)', ' Although in their endnotes (p', '349-50), they seem to endorse the Diombos of the Viscount of Santarem', "" although this does not find many adherents for the same reasons of being too close to Tristão's last point"", '  Modern historians believe both Zurara and Barros greatly exaggerated in implying Álvaro Fernandes reached modern Guinea', 'Duarte Leite (1941), Damião Peres (1943), Magalhães Godinho (1945), Teixeira da Mota, 1946 In particular, it is highly unlikely he would have sailed past the huge Geba River and the many Bissagos Islands and other notable promontories and landmarks without exploring them or making the least mention of them', '  Moreover, Zurara claims that all along Fernandes\'s route from Cape Vert, the ""coast tendeth generally south"",Zurara, p', '261 thus eliminating the wilder estimates (the coast runs steadily southeast after Cape Roxo)', '  Reviewing the evidence, Teixeira da Mota suggests that the ""Tabite"" river Fernandes sailed up was probably the Casamance River (, Senegal) and the low cape and sandy bay that marked his final point was the stretch around Cape Varela (, just below Cape Roxo, at the northern end of what is now Guinea-Bissau)', 'Teixeira da Mota (1946: II, p', '283)', '  That means Fernandes really sailed 50 leagues (not 110) beyond Cape Vert', '  That still makes it the farthest point reached by the Portuguese discoveries of the 1440s', '  The only real difficulty with the Casamance hypothesis is the use of poisoned arrows, which was common among the Serer, Nimoninka and Mandinka peoples of the Saloum-Gambia area, but not among the Jola people (Felupes) of the Casamance', '  But historians doubt whether Fernandes was actually hit with a poisoned arrow at all, rather than a regular arrow and simply suffered a common infection in the aftermath', '  The very fact that he survived suggests it was not poisoned, as does the fact that no other sailors reported any similar injuries', 'Teixeira da Mota, p', '282  (It contrasts sharply with the fate of Nuno Tristão and his crew in the Diombos River, where a score of men fell dead quickly from Niominka poison', "" Given Tristão's fate, Zurara may have simply assumed all tribes south of Cape Verde used poison"", 'Teixeira da Mota, p', ""282-83)  The other footnote is why Fernandes' caravel was ambushed on the river by the Jola of the Casamance, who were unfamiliar with the Portuguese"", ' Teixeira da Mota points to the abduction of the woman on the bank may have alerted the river peoples to the hostile intentions of the Portuguese', '  This contrasts with the Jola people on the beaches of Cape Varela, whose festive reception and hailing to the Portuguese ships from the shore reveals they had little or no prior notion of Portuguese slavers', 'Teixeira da Mota, p', '282-83  Unfortunately, Zurara reports no topographic names bestowed by Álvaro Fernandes on his second journey, and the imprecise magnitudes reported (""some days"", ""a certain distance"") are not very elucidating, leaving this conclusion still open to dispute', ' All that seems certain is that Fernandes sailed beyond his previous marker in 1446, and that this would remain standing as the record length reached by the Portuguese discoveries for the next decade', ""  Fernandes's marker was only surpassed ten years later, in 1456, by Alvise Cadamosto, a Venetian explorer in Henry's service"", '  Cadamosto laid claim

years because of the Casamance Conflict, Carabane has continued to attract ornithologists interested in its wide variety of birds', ' Various species of fish are plentiful around the island, but there are very few mammals', '  The earliest known inhabitants of the island were the Jola, the ethnic group which is still the most populous on the island', ' The Portuguese were active in the region from the 16th century onwards; however, they did not linger on ""Mosquito Island"", the mosquitoes and black flies convincing them to establish their trading post in the town of Ziguinchor instead in
