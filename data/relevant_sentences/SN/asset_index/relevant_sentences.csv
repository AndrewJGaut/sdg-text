SN-2012-6Z-00000194,"The rice cycle plays a central economic and religious role in the lives of the population. The fishery has long been dominated by artisan fishing, which supplies the daily needs of the island's population; however, broader economic possibilities have been exploited since the early 20th century. There are various reasons for the degradation, including crustaceans and the unregulated exploitation of wood. These palm trees are a valued resource on the island. The colonial administration wanted to expand its influence around the river, particularly because the inhabitants of Gorée were threatened with losing part of their resources with the imminent demise of the slave trade, and also because of their competition with Saint-Louis. Still, another treaty made Sédhiou the primary trading post of Casamance, and the exploitation of Carabane was left for some time in the hands of the Baudin family, first Pierre then his brother Jean. In 1850, the island's economic growth was disturbed because of an extensive livestock raid which precipitated further incidents the following year. Under Senegalese law, the leader of the village has certain prerogatives, including law enforcement, tax collection, and keeping of vital records in the village. The island experienced a decline in the 20th century, when Ziguinchor emerged as the regional capital, and more recently because of the negative economic consequences resulting from the Casamance Conflict and the Joola tragedy. Transportation and energy From the colonizers' perspective, Carabane's position at the mouth of the river was an undeniable asset. In Basse Casamance, the rice cycle structures the lives of the population and plays a central economic and religious role. Palm oil and palm wine Among the agricultural activities practised during the dry season, which halts work in the rice fields, the most traditional are those related to the exploitation of African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), which provides two products which are very popular in the region: palm oil and palm wine. They are harvested during the dry season, mainly by women, who control, from harvest to distribution, an activity that requires little investment and provides them with some financial independence. Those who opposed tourism in Senegal described it as a new form of colonialism while supporters saw it as a panacea that would cure the country of underdevelopment. Inspired by Gorée's example, Carabane is attempting to pay homage to victims of slavery by starting a small museum like the House of Slaves"

SN-2012-6Z-00000194,"The rice cycle plays a central economic and religious role in the lives of the population. The fishery has long been dominated by artisan fishing, which supplies the daily needs of the island's population; however, broader economic possibilities have been exploited since the early 20th century. There are various reasons for the degradation, including crustaceans and the unregulated exploitation of wood. These palm trees are a valued resource on the island. The colonial administration wanted to expand its influence around the river, particularly because the inhabitants of Gorée were threatened with losing part of their resources with the imminent demise of the slave trade, and also because of their competition with Saint-Louis. Still, another treaty made Sédhiou the primary trading post of Casamance, and the exploitation of Carabane was left for some time in the hands of the Baudin family, first Pierre then his brother Jean. In 1850, the island's economic growth was disturbed because of an extensive livestock raid which precipitated further incidents the following year. Under Senegalese law, the leader of the village has certain prerogatives, including law enforcement, tax collection, and keeping of vital records in the village. The island experienced a decline in the 20th century, when Ziguinchor emerged as the regional capital, and more recently because of the negative economic consequences resulting from the Casamance Conflict and the Joola tragedy. Transportation and energy From the colonizers' perspective, Carabane's position at the mouth of the river was an undeniable asset. In Basse Casamance, the rice cycle structures the lives of the population and plays a central economic and religious role. Palm oil and palm wine Among the agricultural activities practised during the dry season, which halts work in the rice fields, the most traditional are those related to the exploitation of African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), which provides two products which are very popular in the region: palm oil and palm wine. They are harvested during the dry season, mainly by women, who control, from harvest to distribution, an activity that requires little investment and provides them with some financial independence. Those who opposed tourism in Senegal described it as a new form of colonialism while supporters saw it as a panacea that would cure the country of underdevelopment. Inspired by Gorée's example, Carabane is attempting to pay homage to victims of slavery by starting a small museum like the House of Slaves"
SN-2010-6#-00000373,"Some historians argue that the commoditization and commercialization of healthcare, moving from the colonial to the post-colonial era, has reduced health care to a convenience that is only available to the wealthy, with those in dire poverty often unable to access care. As a result of the development of health care infrastructure in the colonial era by the French, access remains very uneven across regions and between income levels. The system has been the subject of much criticism, especially because of the increasing demands of profitability and the corruption in this part of the government as in other domains of public life. However, because most local officials have no training on how decentralization should work; there has been a vacuum in terms of planning and management, and weak institutional capacity and the few resources to allocate among increasing responsibilities have exacerbated issues. There have been additional issues in creating conflicts between city officials and medical district officers over disbursement of money for the health sector. Privatization in Senegal has meant that user fees and the sales of pharmaceuticals finance a significant part of the health sector. The state still funds the health sector by paying salaries of state employees and giving each district a discretionary budget each year that it decides. At the individual level, the likelihood of seeking treatment is influenced by the relationship to the head of the household, employment status, gender, and age.
