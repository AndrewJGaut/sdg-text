However, it was not very long before the Chinese began to reassert their authority in the region:  From an earlier part of the same text comes the following addition:  The first passage continues:   Three Kingdoms to the Sui dynasty  These centuries are marked by a general silence in sources on Kashgar and the Tarim Basin', '  The Weilüe, composed in the second third of the 3rd century, mentions

seems to have ended roughly about (170), near the end of Han power', ' So, we cannot be sure that this is a reference to the state of affairs during the Cao Wei (220-265), or whether it refers to the situation before the civil war during the Later Han when China lost touch with most foreign countries and came to be divided into three separate kingdoms', '  Chapter 30 of the Records of the Three Kingdoms says that after the beginning of the Wei Dynasty (220) the states of the Western Regions did not arrive as before, except for the larger ones such as Kucha, Khotan, Kangju, Wusun, Kashgar,
