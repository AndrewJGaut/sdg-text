sandstone that has been subject to the ""atmogenic process"" (defined in the Merriam Webster dictionary as ""atmospheric origin by condensation, wind action, or deposition from volcanic vapors"") of water and wind erosion resulting in ""rare and colourful formations"" in the form of sculptures.The Canyon of Temirlik River within a band of foothills of a mountain river Charyn included in a protected area of Saranskiy National Park formed in 2004.On the territory of this object was a huge lake before.At this point, the river is relatively wide, shallow and calm.Like all canyons cut by river waters, the Temirlik appears across the road unexpectedly, it is difficult to notice it from a distance.Wind, water and sand sculpted Charyn's red sandstone to form its shapes and shades.Adventure sports activities in the river include white-water rafting and canoeing.One of the most striking parts of the canyon is known as ""Valley of Castles"", for its unusual rock formations created by wind, sun, and water and vertical cliffs reminding the ancient castles.In 2021, the Chair of Kazakh National Geographic Society’s, Orman Nurbayev, and project manager, Zhanibek Alkeev, announced the addition of eco-toilets, gazebos, shade awnings, drinking fountains, and observation decks to the Charyn Canyon tourism area"

sandstone that has been subject to the ""atmogenic process"" (defined in the Merriam Webster dictionary as ""atmospheric origin by condensation, wind action, or deposition from volcanic vapors"") of water and wind erosion resulting in ""rare and colourful formations"" in the form of sculptures.The Canyon of Temirlik River within a band of foothills of a mountain river Charyn included in a protected area of Saranskiy National Park formed in 2004.On the territory of this object was a huge lake before.At this point, the river is relatively wide, shallow and calm.Like all canyons cut by river waters, the Temirlik appears across the road unexpectedly, it is difficult to notice it from a distance.Wind, water and sand sculpted Charyn's red sandstone to form its shapes and shades.Adventure sports activities in the river include white-water rafting and canoeing.One of the most striking parts of the canyon is known as ""Valley of Castles"", for its unusual rock formations created by wind, sun, and water and vertical cliffs reminding the ancient castles.In 2021, the Chair of Kazakh National Geographic Society’s, Orman Nurbayev, and project manager, Zhanibek Alkeev,
