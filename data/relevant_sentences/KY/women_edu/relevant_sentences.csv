 Non-adherence to visual approach rules, as the crew did not keep visual contact with the runway and/or ground references and did not follow the prescribed procedures after they lost visual contact;  Loss of altitude control during the missed approach (which was performed because the PIC incorrectly evaluated the aircraft position in comparison with the required descent flight path when he decided to perform visual straight-in approach);

Forest Preserve in 1885', ' Early on, skiers would side-step or hike their way more than 3,000 feet to the top of the wooded trails', '  Skiing enthusiasts in the 1940s pressured politicians to develop Belleayre for families and extreme skiers alike', '  In 1947, bills were introduced allowing the State of New York to create Belleayre Mountain', '  Construction began in 1949, and Belleayre began its premier winter season with five trails, an electrically powered rope tow, New York’s first chairlift (A Roebling Single, later converted to a double), a summit lodge, a temporary base lodge with a cafeteria and dirt floors, and parking for 300', '  Belleayre was immediately popular among local residents and became a center for winter sports in the region and an economic catalyst for surrounding communities', '    As business increased, Belleayre expanded its skiing terrain, adding 12 new trails, 3 lifts, and a new base lodge in the 1950s', ' Major expansions and technology and equipment upgrades continued in the following decades', '  The 1970s included the addition of snowmaking technology', '  In 1977, the Roebling Double Chairlift was replaced by a Double Chairlift from Hall', ' The Hall Double was called the Summit Double Chairlift', '  In 1982, two double chairlifts sharing towers by Doppelmayr were installed to service the lower green terrain, called Lift 1 and Lift 2', '   In 1986, a Riblet Triple Chairlift with a mid-station was installed to service the top of the mountain from the Overlook and Sunset Lodges', ' This lift was used for summer sky rides until 2017', '  In 1991, the current Deer Run trail and Cayuga were cut on the west side', '  In 1999, Garaventa installed two fixed-grip quad chairlifts with mid stations were installed that served the upper half of the mountain these two chairlifts were called Superchief and Tomahawk', ' The Superchief Quad was installed to replace the Hall Summit Double Chairlift', ' The Hall Summit Double was relocated to Plattekill Mountain as the North Face Double Chairlift', ' The Tomahawk Quad was installed on the west side of Belleayre to serve the Belleayre summit', ' It served new terrain from the summit and terrain formerly accessible by a Roebling T-Bar', '   In 2001, the Tomahawk parking lot along with the Dot Nebel opened on the west side of Belleayre', ' Which was able to provide the new area with easier access and increase skier visits to that area', '  In 2006, the Superchief Fixed Grip Quad was upgraded to a Detachable High-Speed Quad by Doppelmayr/CTEC, and many parts were installed as the Ridge Quad at Catamount Ski Area', '  In November 2012, the resort was transferred from the NYS DEC to the Olympic Regional Development Authority (ORDA)', ' ORDA also operates Gore Mountain and Whiteface Mountain ski resorts', '   During the 2017-2018 ski season, an eight-passenger gondola, named Catskill Thunder, began operation', ' It is the only gondola lift in The Catskills', ' And only one of 3 gondolas in NY state, all of them being on ORDA mountains', ' This lift is the longest in the Catskills and revolutionized the future of Belleayre forever', '  In the 2018-19 season, a new state-of-the-art medical building was constructed on the side of parking lot E on the old location of the Tee Pee Flats learning area', ' The building replaced an old and small facility at the top of the Lightning Quad', ' The new facility is also more accessible to the discovery lodge, where most people visit today due to the gondola', '  During the 2019-2020 season, a new fixed-grip quad lift named Lightning replaced Lift 1 and Lift 2', ' This lift had a loading carpet, hockey puck footrests that are safer for children, and comfortable padding for the seats', ' Even though no problems were reported with the old lifts, the new lift was most likely installed to make it easier for beginners and to create a new bunny slope by shortening the liftline', '  Trails
