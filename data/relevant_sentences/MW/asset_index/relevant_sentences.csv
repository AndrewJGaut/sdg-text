protectorate and they set up a military administration at the north of the mountain at Fort Lister and to the south at Fort Anderson', "" The staffing of these forts with Indian soldiers started Malawi's now longstanding links with the Indian sub-continent"", '  From this time, there were also inward migrations of the Lomwe people from the Portuguese east, escaping both colonial and Yao

under threat of extinction', ' Mulanje cedar is a pioneer species, not a climax species, meaning that it is good at taking advantage of sites that become free of other competing species but it is not successful in open competition', ' When fire destroys the trees in an area of woodland, Mulanje cedar will normally be the first tree species to re-establish itself', ' Other species will come in later, but because the cedar is relatively fast growing, it will not face much competition for sunlight', '  The Malawi Department of Forestry is responsible for protecting the cedar forests from damaging fires', ' Each year, at the beginning of the dry season, firebreaks are cleared of vegetation to provide barriers that will impede the advance of wildfires', ' In addition, controlled early burning is carried out to reduce the build-up of combustible material that might cause intense and damaging fires later in the dry season', ' For further safety, gangs equipped with fire-fighting equipment are stationed on each of the main plateau areas whenever there is a fire hazard', '         As well as providing protection from fires, the Department of Forestry is responsible for

of rain water at the head of almost every river that runs through this part of Malawi', '  The forested slopes of the Massif support a sizeable timber industry', ' At one time there was a cableway to

protectorate and they set up a military administration at the north of the mountain at Fort Lister and to the south at Fort Anderson', "" The staffing of these forts with Indian soldiers started Malawi's now longstanding links with the Indian sub-continent"", '  From this time, there were also inward migrations of the Lomwe people from the Portuguese east, escaping both colonial and Yao

under threat of extinction', ' Mulanje cedar is a pioneer species, not a climax species, meaning that it is good at taking advantage of sites that become free of other competing species but it is not successful in open competition', ' When fire destroys the trees in an area of woodland, Mulanje cedar will normally be the first tree species to re-establish itself', ' Other species will come in later, but because the cedar is relatively fast growing, it will not face much competition for sunlight', '  The Malawi Department of Forestry is responsible for protecting the cedar forests from damaging fires', ' Each year, at the beginning of the dry season, firebreaks are cleared of vegetation to provide barriers that will impede the advance of wildfires', ' In addition, controlled early burning is carried out to reduce the build-up of combustible material that might cause intense and damaging fires later in the dry season', ' For further safety, gangs equipped with fire-fighting equipment are stationed on each of the main plateau areas whenever there is a fire hazard', '         As well as providing protection from fires, the Department of Forestry is responsible for
