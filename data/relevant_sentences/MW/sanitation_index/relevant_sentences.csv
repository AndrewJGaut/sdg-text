The overall cost to the economy (and healthcare system) is unknown. There are many investment barriers in Malawi, which the government has failed to address, including high service costs and poor infrastructure for power, water, and telecommunications. In 2012, most foreign investments flowed to infrastructure (62%) and the energy sector (33%). In 2013, the Malawi Investment and Trade Centre put together an investment portfolio spanning 20 companies in the country's six major economic growth sectors, namely: agriculture; manufacturing; energy (bio-energy, mobile electricity); tourism (ecolodges); infrastructure (wastewater services, fiber optic cables, etc. , master's and first-degree levels, supported by the UK Wellcome Trust and DfID; Strides made in conducting cotton confined field trials, with support from the US Program for Biosafety Systems, Monsanto, and LUANAR; Introduction of ethanol fuel as an alternative fuel to petrol and the adoption of ethanol technology; Launch of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Policy for Malawi in December 2013, to drive the deployment of ICTs in all economic and productive sectors and improve ICT infrastructure in rural areas, especially via the establishment of telecentres; and A review of secondary school curricula in 2013. Malawi's healthcare goal is for ""promoting health, preventing, reducing and curing disease, and reducing the occurrence of premature death in the population"".
