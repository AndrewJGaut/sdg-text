Mount Kenya is a major water tower for the Tana river which in 1988 supplied 80% of Kenya's electricity using a series of seven hydroelectric powerstations and dams. Combined, these water sources feed 11 glaciers. As the streams flowed even in the driest seasons he concluded that there must be a source of water up on the mountain, in the form of glaciers.
