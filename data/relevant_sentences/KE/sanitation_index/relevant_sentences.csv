in the following years', ' It was first climbed in 1899 by Halford Mackinder', ' The mountain became a national park in 1949, played a key role in the Mau Mau events in the 1950s, and became a UNESCO

Mount Kenya received its current name by European missionaries who, wrote the name as 'Kenya' from the Akamba word 'kiinyaa'"", ' The first missionaries, Johann Ludwig Krapf, and Johannes Rebmann,

what they called the mountain, and the guide, believing that the Germans were referring to the gourd, replied kĩĩ-nyaa, which became the name of the mountain and then the country', ""  Other ethnic groups living around the mountain such as the Agikuyu called this mountain 'Kirinyaga'; 'nyaga' in Kikuyu means white patches, hence it is also the Kikuyu word for Ostrich, and 'kiri' means with: so

note that at the time this referred to the mountain without having to include mountain in the name', ' The current name Mount Kenya was used by some as early as 1894, but this was not a regular occurrence until 1920 when Kenya Colony was established', ' Before 1920 the area now known as Kenya was known as the British East Africa Protectorate and so there was no need to mention mount when

Kenia was occasionally used', ' At this time both were still pronounced  in English', '  Kenya achieved independence in 1963, and Jomo Kenyatta was elected as the first president', ' He had previously assumed this name to reflect his commitment to freeing his country and his pronunciation of his name resulted in the pronunciation of Kenya in English changing back to an approximation of the original native pronunciation, the current ', ' So the country was named after the colony, which in turn was named after the mountain as it is a very significant landmark', ' To distinguish easily between the

KE-2015-7Z-00000084,"['[[File:Mount Kenya Summit photomap-en', 'svg|thumb|right|225px|Summit of Mount Kenya, with names of main glaciers,  valleys and peaks]] Mount Kenya () is the second highest mountain in Africa and the highest mountain in Kenya, after which the country is named', ' It lies just south of the equator and currently has eleven small glaciers', ' Various expeditions reached it in the following years', ' It was first climbed in 1899 by Halford Mackinder', ' The mountain became a national park in 1949, played a key role in the Mau Mau events in the 1950s, and became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997', ' It is climbed and walked up by up to 15,000 tourists every year', '  Mount Kenya right|thumb|This 1911 map shows the region around Mount Kenya labelled as Kenya', "" Mount Kenya received its current name by European missionaries who, wrote the name as 'Kenya' from the Akamba word 'kiinyaa'"", ' The first missionaries, Johann Ludwig Krapf, and Johannes Rebmann, were led into Kenyas interior by Akamba long-distance traders', "" So when they asked the name of the mountain, they were given the name 'kiima kya kenia'"", "" 'kenia' in Kamba means to glitter, or to shine, hence the Akamba people referred to it as the mountain that glitters, or the shining mountain"", ' So these missionaries recorded it as Mt', ' Kenya, a Kamba word, and the country was then later named after this mountain', ' Wangari Maathai tells the following story about the naming: Krapf and Johannes Rebmann asked their guide, a member of the Kamba community, who was carrying a gourd, what they called the mountain, and the guide, believing that the Germans were referring to the gourd, replied kĩĩ-nyaa, which became the name of the mountain and then the country', ""  Other ethnic groups living around the mountain such as the Agikuyu called this mountain 'Kirinyaga'; 'nyaga' in Kikuyu means white patches, hence it is also the Kikuyu word for Ostrich, and 'kiri' means with: so in essence they called it the mountain with ostriches"", ' The Maasai call it Ol Donyo Eibor or Ol Donyo Egere, which mean ""the White mountain"" or ""the speckled mountain"" respectively', '  Krapf was staying in a Wakamba village when he first saw the mountain', ' Krapf, however, recorded the name as both Kenia and Kegnia', ' According to some sources, this is a corruption of the Wakamba Kiinyaa', ' Others however say that this was on the contrary a very precise notation of a native word pronounced ', ' Nevertheless, the name was usually pronounced  in English', '  It is important to note that at the time this referred to the mountain without having to include mountain in the name', ' The current name Mount Kenya was used by some as early as 1894, but this was not a regular occurrence until 1920 when Kenya Colony was established', ' Before 1920 the area now known as Kenya was known as the British East Africa Protectorate and so there was no need to mention mount when referring to the mountain', "" Mount Kenya was not the only English name for the mountain as shown in Dutton's 1929 book Kenya Mountain"", ' By the 1930s Kenya was becoming the dominant spelling, but Kenia was occasionally used', ' At this time both were still pronounced  in English', '  Kenya achieved independence in 1963, and Jomo Kenyatta was elected as the first president', ' He had previously assumed this name to reflect his commitment to freeing his country and his pronunciation of his name resulted in the pronunciation of Kenya in English changing back to an approximation of the original native pronunciation, the current ', ' So the country was named after the colony, which in turn was named after the mountain as it is a very significant landmark', ' To distinguish easily between the country and the mountain, the mountain became known as Mount Kenya  with the current pronunciation ', ' Mount Kenya is featured on the coat of arms of Kenya', '  Peaks thumb|right|Lenana was the Chief Medicine-Man of the Maasai circa 1890', ' Pt Lenana was named after him by Halford Mackinder', ' Lenana was the son of Batian who was the previous Chief Medicine-Man', ' The peaks of Mount Kenya have been given names from three different sources', ' Firstly, several Maasai chieftains have been commemorated, with names such as Batian, Nelion and Lenana', "" These names were suggested by Mackinder, on the suggestion of Sidney Langford Hinde, who was the resident officer in Maasailand at the time of Mackinder's expedition"", ' They commemorate Mbatian, a Maasai Laibon (Medicine Man), Nelieng, his brother, and Lenana and Sendeyo, his sons', ' Terere is named after another Maasai headman', '  The second type of names that were given to peaks are after climbers and explorers', ' Some examples of this are Shipton, Sommerfelt, Tilman, Dutton and Arthur', ' Shipton made the first ascent of Nelion, and Sommerfelt accompanied Shipton on the second ascent', ' Tilman made many first ascents of peaks with Shipton in 1930', ' Dutton and Arthur explored the mountain between 1910 and 1930', "" Arthur Firmin, who made many first ascents, has been remembered in Firmin's Col"", ' Humphrey Slade, of Pt Slade, explored the moorland areas of the mountain in the 1930s, and possibly made the first ascent of Sendeyo', '  The remaining names are after well-known Kenyan personalities, with the exception of John and Peter, which were named by the missionary Arthur after two disciples', "" Pigott was the Acting Administrator of Imperial British East Africa at the time of Gregory's expedition, and there is a group of four peaks to the east of the main peaks named after governors of Kenya and early settlers; Coryndon, Grigg, Delamere and McMillan"", '  The majority of the names were given by Melhuish and

assumed this name to reflect his commitment to freeing his country and his pronunciation of his name resulted in the pronunciation of Kenya in English changing back to an approximation of the original

mountain in Africa and the highest mountain in Kenya, after which the country is named', ' It lies just south of the equator and currently has eleven small glaciers', ' Various expeditions reached it in the following years', ' It was first climbed in 1899 by Halford Mackinder', ' The mountain became a national park in 1949, played a key role in the Mau Mau events in the 1950s, and became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997', ' It is climbed and walked up by up to 15,000 tourists every year', '  Mount Kenya right|thumb|This 1911 map shows the region around Mount Kenya labelled as Kenya', "" Mount Kenya received its current name by European missionaries who, wrote the name as 'Kenya' from the Akamba word 'kiinyaa'"", ' The first missionaries, Johann Ludwig Krapf, and Johannes Rebmann, were led into Kenyas interior by Akamba long-distance traders', "" So when they asked the name of the mountain, they were given the name 'kiima kya kenia'"", "" 'kenia' in Kamba means to glitter, or to shine, hence the Akamba people referred to it as the mountain that glitters, or the shining mountain"", ' So these missionaries recorded it as Mt', ' Kenya, a Kamba word, and the country was then later named after this mountain', ' Wangari Maathai tells the following story about the naming: Krapf and Johannes Rebmann asked their guide, a member of the Kamba community, who was carrying a gourd, what they called the mountain, and the guide, believing that the Germans were referring to the gourd, replied kĩĩ-nyaa, which became the name of the mountain and then the country', ""  Other ethnic groups living around the mountain such as the Agikuyu called this mountain 'Kirinyaga'; 'nyaga' in Kikuyu means white patches, hence it is also the Kikuyu word for Ostrich, and 'kiri' means with: so in essence they called it the mountain with ostriches"", ' The Maasai call it Ol Donyo Eibor or Ol Donyo Egere, which mean ""the White mountain"" or ""the speckled mountain"" respectively', '  Krapf was staying in a Wakamba village when he first saw the mountain', ' Krapf, however, recorded the name as both Kenia and Kegnia', ' According to some sources, this is a corruption of the Wakamba Kiinyaa', ' Others however say that this was on the contrary a very precise notation of a native word pronounced ', ' Nevertheless, the name was usually pronounced  in English', '  It is important to note that at the time this referred to the mountain without having to include mountain in the name', ' The current name Mount Kenya was used by some as early as 1894, but this was not a regular occurrence until 1920 when Kenya Colony was established', ' Before 1920 the area now known as Kenya was known as the British East Africa Protectorate and so there was no need to mention mount when referring to the mountain', "" Mount Kenya was not the only English name for the mountain as shown in Dutton's 1929 book Kenya Mountain"", ' By the 1930s Kenya was becoming the dominant spelling, but Kenia was occasionally used', ' At this time both were still pronounced  in English', '  Kenya achieved independence in 1963, and Jomo Kenyatta was elected as the first president', ' He had previously assumed this name to reflect his commitment to freeing his country and his pronunciation of his name resulted in the pronunciation of Kenya in English changing back to an approximation of the original native pronunciation, the current ', ' So the country was named after the colony, which in turn was named after the mountain as it is a very significant landmark', ' To distinguish easily between the

Giovanni Battista Cairati, it was built between 1593 and 1596 by order of King Felipe II of Castille, who also reigned as King Filipe I of Portugal and the Algarves, to guard the Old Port of Mombasa', ' Fort Jesus was the only fort maintained by the Portuguese on the Swahili coast, and is recognised as a testament to the first successful attempt by a Western power to establish influence over the Indian Ocean trade', '  Cairato, the designer of the fort, was inspired by Italian architect Pietro Cataneo, while the master builder was Gaspar Rodrigues', "" The fort was Cairato's last overseas work"", ' Although the design of Fort Jesus is an example of Renaissance architecture, the masonry techniques, building materials and labour are believed to have been provided by the local Swahili people', ' The fort was built in the shape of a man (viewed from the air) and is roughly square, with four bulwarks at its corners', ' The fort is considered a masterpiece of late Renaissance military fortification', '  Fort Jesus was captured and recaptured at least nine times between 1631, when the Portuguese lost it to the Sultan Yusuf ibn al-Hasan of Mombasa, and 1895 when it fell under British rule and was converted into a prison', ' After the Portuguese recaptured it from the Sultan in 1632, they refurbished it and built more fortifications, subsequently making it harder for the fort to fall', ' The fort was subject to an epic two-year siege from 1696-98 by the Omani Arabs, led by Saif bin Sultan', ' The capture of the fort marked the end of Portuguese presence on the coast, although

clear, but perhaps linked to the Kikuyu, Embu and Kamba words Kirinyaga, Kirenyaa and Kiinyaa which mean ""God\'s resting place"" in all three languages', '  In the 19th Century, the German explorer, Ludwig Krapf, recorded the name as both Kenia and Kegnia believed by some to be a corruption of the Kamba version', ' Others however say that this was on the contrary a very precise notation of the correct African pronunciation ', '  Wangari Maathai tells the following story about the naming: Krapf and Johannes Rebmann asked their guide, a member of the Kamba community, who was carrying a gourd, what they called the mountain, and the guide, believing that the Germans were referring to the gourd, replied kĩĩ-nyaa, which became the name of the mountain and then the country', '  In any case, the name was for a long time pronounced by colonial-heritage Europeans as ', ' The European pronunciation has been abandoned in modern times, in favor of the African version', '  Names of peaks The peaks of Mount Kenya have been given names from three different sources', ' Firstly, several Maasai chieftains have been commemorated, with names such as Batian, Nelion and Lenana', ' They commemorate Mbatian, a Maasai Laibon (Medicine Man), Nelieng, his brother, and Lenana and Sendeyo, his sons', ' Terere is named after another Maasai headman', '  The second type of names that were given to peaks are after European climbers and explorers', ' Some examples of this are Shipton, Sommerfelt, Tilman, Dutton and Arthur', '  The remaining names are after well-known Kenyan personalities, with the

KE-2015-7Z-00000084,"['[[File:Mount Kenya Summit photomap-en', 'svg|thumb|right|225px|Summit of Mount Kenya, with names of main glaciers,  valleys and peaks]] Mount Kenya () is the second highest mountain in Africa and the highest mountain in Kenya, after which the country is named', ' It lies just south of the equator and currently has eleven small glaciers', ' Various expeditions reached it in the following years', ' It was first climbed in 1899 by Halford Mackinder', ' The mountain became a national park in 1949, played a key role in the Mau Mau events in the 1950s, and became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997', ' It is climbed and walked up by up to 15,000 tourists every year', '  Mount Kenya right|thumb|This 1911 map shows the region around Mount Kenya labelled as Kenya', "" Mount Kenya received its current name by European missionaries who, wrote the name as 'Kenya' from the Akamba word 'kiinyaa'"", ' The first missionaries, Johann Ludwig Krapf, and Johannes Rebmann, were led into Kenyas interior by Akamba long-distance traders', "" So when they asked the name of the mountain, they were given the name 'kiima kya kenia'"", "" 'kenia' in Kamba means to glitter, or to shine, hence the Akamba people referred to it as the mountain that glitters, or the shining mountain"", ' So these missionaries recorded it as Mt', ' Kenya, a Kamba word, and the country was then later named after this mountain', ' Wangari Maathai tells the following story about the naming: Krapf and Johannes Rebmann asked their guide, a member of the Kamba community, who was carrying a gourd, what they called the mountain, and the guide, believing that the Germans were referring to the gourd, replied kĩĩ-nyaa, which became the name of the mountain and then the country', ""  Other ethnic groups living around the mountain such as the Agikuyu called this mountain 'Kirinyaga'; 'nyaga' in Kikuyu means white patches, hence it is also the Kikuyu word for Ostrich, and 'kiri' means with: so in essence they called it the mountain with ostriches"", ' The Maasai call it Ol Donyo Eibor or Ol Donyo Egere, which mean ""the White mountain"" or ""the speckled mountain"" respectively', '  Krapf was staying in a Wakamba village when he first saw the mountain', ' Krapf, however, recorded the name as both Kenia and Kegnia', ' According to some sources, this is a corruption of the Wakamba Kiinyaa', ' Others however say that this was on the contrary a very precise notation of a native word pronounced ', ' Nevertheless, the name was usually pronounced  in English', '  It is important to note that at the time this referred to the mountain without having to include mountain in the name', ' The current name Mount Kenya was used by some as early as 1894, but this was not a regular occurrence until 1920 when Kenya Colony was established', ' Before 1920 the area now known as Kenya was known as the British East Africa Protectorate and so there was no need to mention mount when referring to the mountain', "" Mount Kenya was not the only English name for the mountain as shown in Dutton's 1929 book Kenya Mountain"", ' By the 1930s Kenya was becoming the dominant spelling, but Kenia was occasionally used', ' At this time both were still pronounced  in English', '  Kenya achieved independence in 1963, and Jomo Kenyatta was elected as the first president', ' He had previously assumed this name to reflect his commitment to freeing his country and his pronunciation of his name resulted in the pronunciation of Kenya in English changing back to an approximation of the original native pronunciation, the current ', ' So the country was named after the colony, which in turn was named after the mountain as it is a very significant landmark', ' To distinguish easily between the country and the mountain, the mountain became known as Mount Kenya  with the current pronunciation ', ' Mount Kenya is featured on the coat of arms of Kenya', '  Peaks thumb|right|Lenana was the Chief Medicine-Man of the Maasai circa 1890', ' Pt Lenana was named after him by Halford Mackinder', ' Lenana was the son of Batian who was the previous Chief Medicine-Man', ' The peaks of Mount Kenya have been given names from three different sources', ' Firstly, several Maasai chieftains have been commemorated, with names such as Batian, Nelion and Lenana', "" These names were suggested by Mackinder, on the suggestion of Sidney Langford Hinde, who was the resident officer in Maasailand at the time of Mackinder's expedition"", ' They commemorate Mbatian, a Maasai Laibon (Medicine Man), Nelieng, his brother, and Lenana and Sendeyo, his sons', ' Terere is named after another Maasai headman', '  The second type of names that were given to peaks are after climbers and explorers', ' Some examples of this are Shipton, Sommerfelt, Tilman, Dutton and Arthur', ' Shipton made the first ascent of Nelion, and Sommerfelt accompanied Shipton on the second ascent', ' Tilman made many first ascents of peaks with Shipton in 1930', ' Dutton and Arthur explored the mountain between 1910 and 1930', "" Arthur Firmin, who made many first ascents, has been remembered in Firmin's Col"", ' Humphrey Slade, of Pt Slade, explored the moorland areas of the mountain in the 1930s, and possibly made the first ascent of Sendeyo', '  The remaining names are after well-known Kenyan personalities, with the exception of John and Peter, which were named by the missionary Arthur after two disciples', "" Pigott was the Acting Administrator of Imperial British East Africa at the time of Gregory's expedition, and there is a group of four peaks to the east of the main peaks named after governors of Kenya and early settlers; Coryndon, Grigg, Delamere and McMillan"", '  The majority of the names were given by Melhuish and

following entities made outright donations to the project:   Government of the Netherlands - €10 million  EU Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund (part of the European Commission) - €25 million', '  Transmission line and substation  In 2010, the Spanish government offered to finance the construction of a 427\xa0km double circuit transmission line southwards from the site to Suswa, approximately 100\xa0km west of Nairobi', ""  The $150 million offer comprises:    A 'concessional loan' of €55 million ($74 million) at an interest of 0"", '10 percent, with a repayment period of 30 years, including a 14-year grace period', "" The loan will be supported by a 'Financial Co-operation Agreement' between Kenya’s Ministry of Finance and Spain’s Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade;  €55 million in 'commercial credit' with support from the Spanish Export Credit Insurance Company on OECD terms;  A 'sovereign guarantee' by the Kenyan Government"", '    This means that the Kenya Electricity Transmission Company (Ketraco), a Government-owned entity created in 2008, will also partly fund the transmission line and the substation by means of a tolling arrangement with Kenya Power', ' Spanish company Isolux Corsán won a $208', '1 million tender for this construction', '  World Bank pulls out of project  LTWP suffered a setback in 2012 when the World Bank withdrew its support for the project', ' Bank officials were reported to have concerns that the electricity produced would outweigh demand', ' The World Bank Group’s country director in Kenya, Johannes Zutt, stated that Kenya could be left with excess power on the grid worth up to KSh8', '5 billion (equivalent to $100 million) per year', ' Originally, the project was expected to be fully operational by the end of 2014', ' From the project perspective, the withdrawal of the World Bank could be seen in a positive light as it allowed LTWP to move forward to financial close', ' A source at power transmission firm Ketraco indicated that the agency was happy with the World Bank’s decision to quit', ' ""We are happy that the World Bank has withdrawn', ' They were putting a lot of hurdles in our way but now we can go ahead', '""  Economic impacts  LTWP will be the largest single private investment in Kenya at the time it is made', "" LTWP claims the wind farm will reduce and possibly eliminate Kenya's dependency on diesel and heavy fuel power stations, however, this claim is unsubstantiated"", ' Fuel imports to power thermal power stations, cost the Kenyan taxpayer US$150 million (KES:17 billion) annually', ' It is anticipated that the project will contribute KES:3 billion (US$35 million) annually, and KES:58', '6 billion (US$673 million), in tax revenue over a period 20 years', ' During construction, approximately 2,500 workers will be hired', ' Once commissioned, the power station will employ 200 full-time staff', '  Impacts on Kenyan State and consumers  The Project is of significant strategic benefit to Kenya, and at Ksh70 billion (€625 million) will be the largest single private investment in Kenya’s history', ' With a power tariff of Euro 7', '52 cents per kWh (11 KSh/kWh), LTWP is one of the lowest power tariffs in Kenya along with geothermal power at 9 Sh', ' Other prices are 3 Sh for hydro and 18 Sh for oil', ' It is estimated that Kenya will save up to $120 million a year in fuel cost by reducing reliance on diesel power plants', '  LTWP’s contract (Power Purchase Agreement) with government-owned Kenya Power obliges the utility to buy all electricity produced by the wind farm, even if it is not needed, or if more economic electricity sources are available; ""The power produced will be bought at a fixed price by Kenya Power (KPLC) over a 20-year period in accordance with the signed Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)', '""  Furthermore, the Kenyan Government has signed guarantees with LTWP to cover costs in case Kenya Power cannot afford to pay for excess electricity for the duration of the PPA', "" In order to mitigate this risk the African Development Fund has provided a 'partial risk guarantee' up to the value of €20 million"", ' The Kenyan Government is also liable for losses incurred by delay due to political causes or project failure, as happened with the power line', ' These costs, as well as the expenses for the transmission line, are therefore likely to be passed on to Kenyan taxpayers and electricity consumers on top of the electricity produced', ' Before the power station opened, some feared that this could result in higher prices for electricity users than previous rates', '  For the fiscal year of 2019, Kenya Power paid KSh 11 billion to LTWP for 1', '1 TWh', '  Grid stability  The LTWP project is of such a large scale that it will provide up to 20% of the Kenyan power grid’s capacity to absorb wind energy', '  It is generally accepted in wind technology research that intermittent resources can destabilise a small grid such as that in Kenya, especially if it is concentrated all in one location', '  Denmark has over 19% wind power (wind capacity of 4,885MW) connected to the grid, but this capacity is supplied across thousands of projects', ' While LTWP aims to provide 310\xa0MW of reliable, low cost wind power to the Kenya national grid, equivalent to approximately 18% of Kenya’ current installed electricity generating capacity', ' As of 2018, Kenya had a total installed capacity of 2300\xa0MW, largely being generated by hydro (46', '3%) and thermal (37', '4%)', ' The Government targets to increase generating capacity to 6762\xa0MW in 2017', ' Kenya also plans to change the energy generation mix, with a view of reducing dependency on hydro and thermal', ' LTWP will play a key role in balancing the energy generation mix', '  In January 2021 Clir Renewables, a Canadian software company based in Vancouver, British Columbia, signed a contract with LTWP, to optimise power generation at the power station', ' The software company will analyse data from each of the 365 turbines at the power station', ' Fluctuations in wind speed at each turbine will be detected and mapped', ' Causes of underperformance at each turbine will be identified and solutions suggested', ' The overall objective is to improve the efficiency of the power plant and improve power output and grid stability', '  Controversies  Indigenous rights issues  LTWP commenced its community engagement activities in 2005, nine years before construction started in October 2014', '  Local Turkana communities filed a lawsuit against LTWP in October 2014 at Meru High Court, Kenya to nullify the titles obtained by the company and return the land to its original status as community land', ' In November 2016 Justice Peter Njoroge of the Meru High Court rejected the application filed by Marsabit residents, requesting the court to stop the Wind Power project', '  In 2015 the intertribal Sarima Indigenous Peoples’ Land Forum (SIPLF) was created as an attempt to bring indigenous communities together in order to stop the wind power project', ' The forum is named after the village of Sarima that was displaced by the project', ' In their Declaration of 7th February 2015 the SIPLF stated the ""El Molo, Rendille, Samburu, Turkana and other indigenous and pastoralist communities of Laisamis Constituency and Karare Ward, in Marsabit County, Northern Kenya, reject the illegal privatization of  of our ancestral land by the European consortium \'Lake Turkana Wind Power Limited\'""', '  The SIPLF stated they were not against wind farm development, if they own and lead the business: ""We are determined to make this happen on the basis of our communities\' ownership and leadership', ' We won\'t allow the theft of our land under any circumstance""', '  Social and Environmental Impacts  Negative social and environmental impacts have also been highlighted in LTWP’s own Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) which would have serious implications for the social, cultural, economic and political well-being of the communities affected', '   LTWP documents detail plans for the construction of a new ""camp"" for 2,500 construction site workers', ' LTWP states that these workers will be employed local workers, trained for the job', ' However, this part of Northern Kenya lacks enough people to provide the labour so LTWP will need to employ most of these workers from outside the local area', '  According to the ESIA, there are a number of potential negative local impacts due to the arrival of the 2,500 workers and the construction work in general', ' These include: cultural contamination, increased risk of disease, community conflicts, challenges of labour force management, occupational hazards, increase in antisocial behavior, increased demand for wood resources in an area with an already ""acute shortage"", sanitation and waste disposal problems, and a decreased livestock grazing area', ""  However, the project's positive social impacts have outweighed the negative ones and the project continues to share project benefits with the local communities through its Winds of Change Foundation"", ' Some locals were informed about the project in 2007, while others expressed a lack of information', ' 1180 people of the Sarima village were relocated and compensated with KSh13,000 (approximately €113), while Samburu people expressed appreciation of the project', '  Capacity charge In August 2017, the Daily Nation reported that  the owners of this power station had, in January 2017, started to bill the Kenya Power Company a monthly ""capacity charge"" of KSh700 million (approx', ' US$7 million), for power produced by the power station that cannot be evacuated due to lack of a high voltage line to transmit it to the substation at Suswa', ' Following negotiations, in September 2017, the government of Kenya agreed to pay the developers of Lake Turkana Wind Power station, a total of Sh5', '7 billion (approx', ' US$55', '83 million), in monthly installments, spread over a six-year period', ' The monthly payment will amount to Sh78,600,000 (approx', ' US$769,833)', ' The monthly surcharge will be passed on to the consumers, beginning in May 2018, when the high-voltage  power line is expected to be completed', '  The transmission line was completed and connected to the national grid on 24 September 2018', ' The delays attracted total penalties of €127 million (KSh14', '5 billion at that time)', ' In a deal struck in 2017, Kenya committed to pay €46 million (KSh5', '7 billion at the time) of the total penalty in lump sum, while the balance of  €81 million (KSh9', '25 billion under prevailing rates) was to be

KE-2015-7Z-00000084,"['[[File:Mount Kenya Summit photomap-en', 'svg|thumb|right|225px|Summit of Mount Kenya, with names of main glaciers,  valleys and peaks]] Mount Kenya () is the second highest mountain in Africa and the highest mountain in Kenya, after which the country is named', ' It lies just south of the equator and currently has eleven small glaciers', ' Various expeditions reached it in the following years', ' It was first climbed in 1899 by Halford Mackinder', ' The mountain became a national park in 1949, played a key role in the Mau Mau events in the 1950s, and became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997', ' It is climbed and walked up by up to 15,000 tourists every year', '  Mount Kenya right|thumb|This 1911 map shows the region around Mount Kenya labelled as Kenya', "" Mount Kenya received its current name by European missionaries who, wrote the name as 'Kenya' from the Akamba word 'kiinyaa'"", ' The first missionaries, Johann Ludwig Krapf, and Johannes Rebmann, were led into Kenyas interior by Akamba long-distance traders', "" So when they asked the name of the mountain, they were given the name 'kiima kya kenia'"", "" 'kenia' in Kamba means to glitter, or to shine, hence the Akamba people referred to it as the mountain that glitters, or the shining mountain"", ' So these missionaries recorded it as Mt', ' Kenya, a Kamba word, and the country was then later named after this mountain', ' Wangari Maathai tells the following story about the naming: Krapf and Johannes Rebmann asked their guide, a member of the Kamba community, who was carrying a gourd, what they called the mountain, and the guide, believing that the Germans were referring to the gourd, replied kĩĩ-nyaa, which became the name of the mountain and then the country', ""  Other ethnic groups living around the mountain such as the Agikuyu called this mountain 'Kirinyaga'; 'nyaga' in Kikuyu means white patches, hence it is also the Kikuyu word for Ostrich, and 'kiri' means with: so in essence they called it the mountain with ostriches"", ' The Maasai call it Ol Donyo Eibor or Ol Donyo Egere, which mean ""the White mountain"" or ""the speckled mountain"" respectively', '  Krapf was staying in a Wakamba village when he first saw the mountain', ' Krapf, however, recorded the name as both Kenia and Kegnia', ' According to some sources, this is a corruption of the Wakamba Kiinyaa', ' Others however say that this was on the contrary a very precise notation of a native word pronounced ', ' Nevertheless, the name was usually pronounced  in English', '  It is important to note that at the time this referred to the mountain without having to include mountain in the name', ' The current name Mount Kenya was used by some as early as 1894, but this was not a regular occurrence until 1920 when Kenya Colony was established', ' Before 1920 the area now known as Kenya was known as the British East Africa Protectorate and so there was no need to mention mount when referring to the mountain', "" Mount Kenya was not the only English name for the mountain as shown in Dutton's 1929 book Kenya Mountain"", ' By the 1930s Kenya was becoming the dominant spelling, but Kenia was occasionally used', ' At this time both were still pronounced  in English', '  Kenya achieved independence in 1963, and Jomo Kenyatta was elected as the first president', ' He had previously assumed this name to reflect his commitment to freeing his country and his pronunciation of his name resulted in the pronunciation of Kenya in English changing back to an approximation of the original native pronunciation, the current ', ' So the country was named after the colony, which in turn was named after the mountain as it is a very significant landmark', ' To distinguish easily between the country and the mountain, the mountain became known as Mount Kenya  with the current pronunciation ', ' Mount Kenya is featured on the coat of arms of Kenya', '  Peaks thumb|right|Lenana was the Chief Medicine-Man of the Maasai circa 1890', ' Pt Lenana was named after him by Halford Mackinder', ' Lenana was the son of Batian who was the previous Chief Medicine-Man', ' The peaks of Mount Kenya have been given names from three different sources', ' Firstly, several Maasai chieftains have been commemorated, with names such as Batian, Nelion and Lenana', "" These names were suggested by Mackinder, on the suggestion of Sidney Langford Hinde, who was the resident officer in Maasailand at the time of Mackinder's expedition"", ' They commemorate Mbatian, a Maasai Laibon (Medicine Man), Nelieng, his brother, and Lenana and Sendeyo, his sons', ' Terere is named after another Maasai headman', '  The second type of names that were given to peaks are after climbers and explorers', ' Some examples of this are Shipton, Sommerfelt, Tilman, Dutton and Arthur', ' Shipton made the first ascent of Nelion, and Sommerfelt accompanied Shipton on the second ascent', ' Tilman made many first ascents of peaks with Shipton in 1930', ' Dutton and Arthur explored the mountain between 1910 and 1930', "" Arthur Firmin, who made many first ascents, has been remembered in Firmin's Col"", ' Humphrey Slade, of Pt Slade, explored the moorland areas of the mountain in the 1930s, and possibly made the first ascent of Sendeyo', '  The remaining names are after well-known Kenyan personalities, with the exception of John and Peter, which were named by the missionary Arthur after two disciples', "" Pigott was the Acting Administrator of Imperial British East Africa at the time of Gregory's expedition, and there is a group of four peaks to the east of the main peaks named after governors of Kenya and early settlers; Coryndon, Grigg, Delamere and McMillan"", '  The majority of the names were given by Melhuish and
